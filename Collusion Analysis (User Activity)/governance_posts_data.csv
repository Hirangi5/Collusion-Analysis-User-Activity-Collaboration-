[Non-constitutional] Proposal to fund Plurality Labs Milestone 1B(ridge)
Vote: For
We are very supportive of this proposal and truthfully believe in the value that funding can create. Creating “the most robust pluralistic grants ecosystem in DAO history” will be challenging, and you will make mistakes. We appreciate that you admitted your mistakes and proposed a solution for them; that is why we are improving.
It takes time to see another 250+ projects succeed. However, as long as Arbitrum still exists and has the proper structure/vision, that time will come.",3

[1]  ARDC Research Member Election
Vote: 75% for Blockworks/Delphi Digital, 25% for The Block
We believe that both of the options will suit the role well. However, we weighted Blockworks and Delphi Digital more based on the active participation of Blockworks Research in the Arbitum DAO and the JV between the two firms.
[2] ARDC DAO Advocate Election
Vote: 100% for L2BEAT/Ant Federation
L2BEAT actively participates in the Arbitrum DAO, commenting, proposing ideas, and creating proposals, making them well-suited for the ARDC DAO Advocate role.
[3] ARDC Security Member Election
Vote: 40% for Trail of Bits, 40% for OpenZeppelin, 10% for Halborn, 10% for Nethermind
We believe that OpenZeppelin and Trail of Bits, with their undisputed expertise in security research, deserve a significant share of the vote. Recognising the importance of nurturing a diverse security landscape, we also support emerging firms like Nethermind and Halborn.

[5] [Non-Emergency Action] Fix Fee Oversight ArbOS v20 “Atlas”
Vote: Set L1 Surplus Fee and L2 minimum
This proposal seeks to adjust Arbitrum’s fee structure to reflect Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade changes. It proposes reducing the L1 surplus fee to 0 and the L2 base fee to 0.01 gwei, aligning with Arbitrum Nova’s settings. While it’s expected to reduce short-term revenue for the ArbitrumDAO, we believe that it will create long-term benefits through increased transaction volume.",4

About Us
Hello Arbitrum community! 404 DAO is Atlanta’s City DAO. We are a community of web3 professionals and students focused on advancing education, innovation, and adoption of blockchain technology in Atlanta. Our governance team is composed of Georgia Tech graduates, Atlanta professionals, and current Georgia Tech students. More information about our team, organization, and voting profiles can be found on our Governance Page.
In addition to our governance work, 404 DAO is the host of Web3 ATL, Atlanta’s largest web3 conference, and is the team behind the 404 Accelerator.
Delegate Statement
The goal of the Arbitrum DAO is to facilitate the success of the Arbitrum network. We believe the DAO should prioritize the following objectives in the support of the aforementioned goal:

Ensure the critical infrastructure and technical mechanisms are developed to enhance user experience, security, and decentralization.
Support the existing projects and protocols that contributed to Arbitrum’s initial success while also incentivizing new users to build on the protocol.
Take a conservative approach to incentivize activity. We believe that implementing thoughtful and well-detailed requirements for grants and incentive programs is crucial to ensuring Arbitrum doesn’t become reliant on subsidized activity.

Skills and Areas of Expertise:
Our team encompasses a wide range of both technical and non-technical backgrounds. These range from analytics and business development to cybersecurity and MEV. The 404 DAO governance team is composed primarily of current and former Georgia Tech students with a wide range of degrees including: Computer Science, Data Science, Business, Finance, Cybersecurity that makes us uniquely able to apply expertise in a wide range of interdisciplinary challenges.
Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest:
404 DAO is also an active delegate in the Optimism DAO and Uniswap DAO. When necessary, we will also disclose other conflicts of interest and at times abstain from voting.",1

Thank you @DisruptionJoe and @thrivegiraffe for answering our questions above, we greatly appreciate the additional details!
At this time our team is still reviewing the documents & sheets provided by PL in their Milestone 1 Review , the January Report , and the information provided above and have therefore voted ABSTAIN in the snapshot.
We look forward to seeing more data points outlined in the upcoming February report as well as the advisory board charter before the onchain vote. Additionally, like @cattin, we would value quantifiable objectives wherever possible and KPIs based on the winners of Milestone 1a. Overall, the Grow, Coach, Cut approach is a great strategy but for it to be effective we strongly believe it needs these quantifiable measuring points.

Some Governance Discussions:
Double-Down on STIP Successes (STIP-Bridge)
Description:
A new proposal has been unveiled to support successful projects under Arbitrum’s Short-term Incentive Program (STIP).
With the competitive landscape heating up in the blockchain space, this initiative aims to empower top projects with grant extensions to bolster Arbitrum’s position.
The proposal includes a budget of 37.5M ARB and utilizes existing vendors and multisig structures to manage overhead efficiently. A simplified voting mechanism will streamline project evaluation, while a clear timeline guides community engagement.
This endeavor seeks to foster growth and resilience in the ecosystem, helping projects thrive amidst rising competition.
Status:
The proposal is currently open for feedback, and a clear timeline has been provided.
Delegate to a public access, public good citizen enfranchisement pool through Event Horizon
Description:
This proposal aims to delegate 5,000,000 ARB to a public-access voter block within the Arbitrum ecosystem to empower small retail voters. By granting a clear voice to retail voters, incentivizing participation with additional governance authority, and promoting governance enthusiasts over those seeking financial gain, the model seeks to address the lack of meaningful representation for individual voters.
Through the concept of Implicit Delegation, which mobilizes the full public governance block, this model aims to boost participation and foster an inclusive governance ecosystem in line with Arbitrum’s values of social inclusivity and openness.
The proposal also suggests future features like an Arbitrum Event Horizon Oversight Committee and anti-Sybil measures.
Status:
The proposal is currently open for feedback, and seeking for funding.
Catalyze Gaming Ecosystem Growth on Arbitrum
Description:
The Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) aims to accelerate the growth of the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum by attracting and supporting top game builders.
With a budget of 200m ARB over two years, the program will provide resources, mentorship, and funding to expedite game development on the network.
By positioning Arbitrum as an attractive platform for game builders, the GCP seeks to diversify the network’s ecosystem and foster the creation of high-quality games that attract and retain users.
Status:
The GCP proposal is currently open for community feedback and discussion. A snapshot vote is scheduled for March 13th, 2024, to gather delegate agreement and receive detailed feedback.
The GCP Council elections and the formation of the GCP Venture Team are planned for April-May 2024.
Grant applications and requests for proposals will also open during this period.

About
Previously, I led the StableLab delegate team that spanned over 15+ DAOs, personally actively engaging in various DAOs including Optimism and Balancer, among others.
My experience spans beyond being a delegate, having served on DeFi Committee A at Optimism, Optimism badge holder since RPGF 2, participated in the GSC at Element Finance, and contributed to the grants council at Compound.
Moreover, I have been an active contributor to the Arbitrum DAO through the LTIP initiative and am excited to escalate my involvement in this DAO.
Purpose
Since becoming a delegate in early 2022, my extensive involvement across multiple DAOs has afforded me valuable insights into the prevalent challenges faced. I plan to use that experience to support Arbitrum DAO in various ways possible, as a delegate, participating in working groups, and other opportunities that arise.
Delegate Communication Intent
I intend to regularly update the community, ensuring transparency and providing comprehensive insights into my decision-making process.
Disclosure
Presently, I am engaged with UMA & Across.",1

AIP: Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix
Vote: For

Vote: For
Rationale: Prior to the approval of plurality labs initial proposal, I was unsure of how this would play out, but I’m glad to say that it exceeded my expectations. Their consistent presence and support has been remarkable.They initiated working groups and programs and retained talent that would have otherwise been unpaid and gone elsewhere. A lot of experiments were conducted, albeit not all successful, but the aim was to experiment, reflect, and improve. There is a lot more that can be done in the arbitrum ecosystem.
Fund Continuation of the Arbitrum DDA Program
Vote: For
Rationale: Questbook has served as a valuable source of funding for the Arbitrum DAO, and the lack of access to the DDA Program has negatively impacted builders in recent months. We are pleased to endorse this proposal, ensuring that builders can tap into these funding opportunities.

Type: Snapshot and Onchain
We supported the aforementioned decision because aligning Arbitrum’s fee structure with these improvements enables the network to accommodate higher transaction throughput while decreasing costs for users. This is crucial for sustaining Arbitrum’s attractiveness in a competitive Layer 2 environment. Although we anticipate a decrease in revenue, it’s a necessary step to ensure Arbitrum remains competitive in pricing. The expectation is that increased transaction volume will offset the reduction in marginal revenues, ultimately restoring total revenue to its previous level—and hopefully surpassing it.",3

Introduction
Hello Arbitrum community, Abdullah and I here! A few months ago, when Arbitrum first airdropped ecosystem projects a significant portion of $ARB, Uniswap received a little over 4 million tokens. After some healthy discussions on how to allocate and use those tokens, a vote was passed through Uniswap governance to create a Uni-Arb Grant Program (UAGP) and Delegate Program (UADP). See the vote here.
The Uniswap-Arbitrum Delegate Program is the Uniswap community’s unique entrance into metagovernance, and Abdullah and I are excited to steward the first 6 months as the committee’s delegation facilitators.
Objectives
Having both led university delegate arms (at Penn and Michigan) across 10+ protocols collectively, we have each voted and participated in hundreds of votes and governance decisions. Arbitrum holds a unique place in the L2 ecosystem, and our goal is to help it scale sustainably, all the while establishing more synergies with Uniswap.
We will transparently and accountably represent both the Uniswap & Arbitrum communities’ interests throughout the governance process. In an effort to be proactive and discerning in our voting contributions, we will ensure that each decision is well-considered and thoroughly researched. Open lines of communication will be a priority, as we plan to regularly share our voting justifications and insights with delegates and community members of both Arbitrum and Uniswap.
Our goal for the UADP is to strive for transparency, efficiency, and broad community involvement.
Disclosure & Waiver of Liability
When applicable, we will disclose conflicts of interest and at times abstain from voting with proper forum rationale.

While it is certainly vital for the DAO to support ecosystem contributors like Arbiters, it’s also important to structure a clearly substantiated plan behind implementing such a rewards program. As far as where this proposal is in its current state, it doesn’t seem to sufficiently outline the details behind who will be distributed the stated $ARB rewards. Since there seems to be a cap of 25 recipients, it would be best to first outline those names explicitly for transparency purposes BEFORE going forward with a vote. This isn’t necessarily for the community to judge the selected individuals, it’s merely to track who is being rewarded prior to voting. It is also unclear what metrics exactly are used to determine the top 25 candidates and if 25 is in fact the optimal number. We are in favor of the spirit of this proposal and hope to enable more contributor-based reward programs in the future, but a more systematic approach at designing this initiative would, in our view, make it more compelling.

Vote: Yes
Creating this proposal was very much a strategic move by the Layer3 team. They could very well have applied as a participant in the STIP race, but they decided to wait until afterwards so they could frame themselves as an initiative that would tie together all the other STIPs. Another reason for not applying during the STIP round is likely because the contents of this proposal would have failed to successfully meet the criteria designated by the STIP designers. Layer3 is NOT distributing the 1M ARB as incentives. The incentives simply come from the $50M STIP pot. Instead, the 1M ARB will be used for development and marketing purposes. Although the breakdown of expenses is not fleshed out to a sufficient degree–granted it’s often hard to anticipate such expenses, but estimates wouldn’t hurt their case–we do see the merits behind questing programs. And since this one is directly tied to helping facilitate the current incentive program that has already been given $50M, it would be a shame if the STIP initiative didn’t prove to be as successful as anticipated. The current Layer3 proposal effectively helps give the STIP initiative a spurt of momentum.

19225,juanbug,2023-11-04 22:25:07,"The Arbitrum Coalition 
Vote: Fund the Coalition
Going forward, large DAOs need to begin hiring professional research and development contractors to equip voters with the information to make informed decisions. Expecting token holders & delegates to over a long period of time and remain consistently up-to-date about proposals is idealistic. Mitigating issues like groupthink is quite difficult and becomes increasingly prominent with technically complex or cumbersome proposals, like the STIP process. Funding well-known groups like Blockworks and Gauntlet to provide data-driven summaries and recommendations is a step towards alleviating voter fatigue/apathy along with groupthink.
The proposal is formatted in a manner that can reasonably prevent concentration of power amongst a small group of service providers. For example, the Advocate will act as the intermediary between the coalition and the DAO, hopefully creating proper checks and balances. We trust that the members that we are electing will act in an unbiased manner and not directionally influence voting decisions. Our previous interactions with the Blockworks and Gauntlet teams is why we can make such a statement.
One of our main concerns, however, is how turnover will be handled between service providers. If a certain SP decides to leave the coalition and they have remaining work to complete, that can become an issue. The departure of an SP that’s had a long tenure is also a friction point. Each new SP will have to go through a slight learning curve to provide services on par with the quality of the previous SP. A good example of this issue can be seen in Aave DAO, in particular with the departure of Llama.",5

Vote (Ranked Choice Voting):

Do not fund staking
Fund staking with 100M ARB
Fund staking with 125M ARB
Fund staking with 150M ARB
Fund staking with 175M ARB

Although the premise of this proposal is that it will create long-term ARB token holders, this activity is entirely incentivized by inflation and should therefore be discounted significantly–this is simply how all incentive programs should be viewed, especially this staking initiative. What makes an ecosystem thrive is the quality of the dapps. That’s why we were in favor of the STIP proposal. Driving users to use dapps is a more effective way to distribute treasury funds, as opposed to just paying token holders. Even though the hope is that a handful of the new ARB holders become long-term investors and/or Arbitrum ecosystem participants, stickiness is very difficult to measure. Instead, more sticky demographics should be rewarded, like builders and devoted community members, which is currently being done via the grant and STIP distributions.
Investors should, however, at some point be compensated–but a pure inflation play, without recognizable ARB utility, isn’t the best way to facilitate that goal. Sharing decentralized sequencer revenue with $ARB stakers is much better utility and can be implemented when the time is right. Incentivizing sequencer stakers is real utility, and that’s an example of where the DAO should designate its future incentive allocations.
Plus, the $ARB token will suffer in other ways because of the alluring staking APRs. Who would want to lend $ARB or be a liquidity provider if you can just stake for a better return? If this proposal passes, the DAO should consider ways to prevent an $ARB drain from dapps. This can be addressed, for example, via protocol owned liquidity provision for particular Uniswap pools. As representatives of the Uniswap DAO and delegates in the Arbitrum DAO, we would like to explore this option.",6
19225,juanbug,2023-11-08 05:10:27,"Non-Constitutional AIP: Arbitrum Security Enhancement Fund
Vote: Against
We are concerned about the proposed funding mechanism. We share similar opinions as @pedrob as allocating 2 million dollars to a single auditor could create a monopoly situation, diminishing the incentive for high service standards due to reduced competition and possibly leading to overcharged service fees due to the large subsidy available.
Additionally, the approach suggested concentrates decision-making power, presenting a risk of centralization in the distribution of funds. This could be counterproductive to the decentralized ethos of the ecosystem​ and crate a lack of checks and balances within this security system.
Possibly, an alternative funding approach suggested in the forums that we’d like to consider more is direct subsidies to protocols that need auditing before deployment on Arbitrum, rather than to a service provider. This would allow for a more equitable and decentralized allocation of funds, ensuring a wide range of protocols can access audit services from a variety of reputable auditors, avoiding the centralization of power and potential service quality issuess.
Overall, we’re happy to see the discussion for the “Consolidate Security Proposals into a RFP Process” arise from this and believe this sets a good standard for votes to come.

This proposal aims to create a structured and transparent approach to selecting auditors and security service providers. This move seeks to replace the current piecemeal method, where individual auditors make separate budget requests, with a comprehensive framework that ensures the community’s due diligence and financial responsibility.
The importance of smart contract security in the Arbitrum ecosystem cannot be overstated, and the proposed RFP structure is intended to attract and fairly compensate top-notch security professionals. This process would be open to all security engineers, researchers, and organizations, ensuring that the selection of service providers is based on merit and qualifications, as well as most importantly, cost-effectiveness​.
The criteria for selection would include the experience and qualifications of security professionals, their audit methodology, and competitive pricing. A committee appointed by the Arbitrum DAO would oversee this selection process, reviewing submissions and choosing the most qualified candidates based on these criteria. We are heavily in favor.",7

One can argue that the 50M allotment was anticipated for a smaller number of participants, and now, back funding is our way to compensate for the unprecedented number of successful applications.

This is in part due to heuristic voting–people just vote for entities that they’re familiar with.

19225,AbdullahUmar,2023-11-17 03:39:17,"Funding Gas Rebate and Trading Competition Program to Amplify Arbitrum’s Ecosystem Growth
Vote: Do Not Fund
We voted against this proposal because general incentive programs initiated by individual protocols are not favorable for the DAO from an organizational perspective. It makes operations more messy. If an individual protocol has a unique contribution to propose–something that goes beyond mere user acquisition via incentive programs–then such a proposal would be intriguing. The reason the STIPs were created was to collectively enable the DAO to choose which protocols should be involved in a large-scale incentive program. Therefore, Rage Trade should have applied for the first round of STIPs. Plus, it’s probably best to ask for incentives when Rage is out of its closed beta phase. Waiting for round 2 of STIPs would therefore be best to re-propose this rebate program.
We also feel that this proposal would be better received if it were created by a collection of perp platforms, not just Rage. This would make it more of a community initiative as opposed to just a Rage Trade initiative (yes, we understand that it’s ideally meant to benefit Arbitrum as a whole, but that means other perp protocols should also be involved in the conversation). It may be wise to talk to the teams at MUX & GMX, for example, and try to co-author such an initiative. Without an inclusive ecosystem buy-in, we feel that this proposal is not as appealing as it could be.",9

Vote: Without Karma, then With Karma, then Against
We are in support of more robust delegate compensation initiatives. Most DAOs today don’t have the bandwidth, financial runway, or even the need to pay delegates for their efforts. Arbitrum, however, is a different story. Due to the broad distribution of the token and continual activity by the token holder & delegate community, multiple initiatives have been implemented. Most importantly, Arbitrum DAO has shown a culture open to experimentation, which is the only way forward for DAOs. To make sure the activity from this year persists perpetually into the future, throwing out a carrot for active delegates is not a bad idea.
We’d be curious to see what material changes occur after this initial 6-month pilot phase concludes. One worry that we’ve always had regarding delegate compensation is selecting data points for rewarding certain behaviors. Should voting be the main criteria? Do you get penalized for voting in a non-consensus direction? Does the quality of your comments count towards your reward? The weighted point system described in this proposal makes sense for this pilot and does address some of our concerns behind what is rewarded. We are glad that it takes into account forum participation and not merely voting participation. Again, this has a good side and a bad side. It’s likely that we’ll see multiple throw-away comments just so users can increase their participation rate for the sake of it. Important discussions will become cluttered with fluff. In an ideal world we’d be able to automate reading responses and devise how “thoughtful” a comment was or how much attention it received. From there, thoughtful comments attain points, while fluff is penalized. These intricacies are to be thought about in the future.
All this being said, we are in favor of the manual option for implementing this proposal. Automating this process can be very valuable, but we believe that testing it out manually will help the SEED Latam team become subject matter experts in this compensation process, and with that experience, they can later collaborate with Karma more effectively, introducing more intricate ways to reward participation in the DAO.",13

Predetermining the cost of each division is also, in our view, premature. We’d like there to be increased discussion around what exactly each division does more specifically—and then ascertain a more detailed compensation plan. Broad proposals like this should start simply by asking for community feedback.
Once enough conversation has transpired, the proposal should be divided up into multiple parts, each detailing more intricately the job of each division and how exactly the RFP process will be conducted. It would also be nice for the proposal author to have potential candidates for this program to comment their perspectives on the program. Post discussion, it should be decided how the voting should take place. One vote may just be a snapshot around the structure of the program, without any mention of compensation. This aspect would determine if there is a need for such a program and what the true job-to-be-done is. Assigning budgets could be a separate discussion and should be better outlined.

Vote: Establish Procurement Committee
We are voting in favor of this proposal but have our reservations with the continuity of this program.
The ARDP and ARDC are both examples of how a DAO can become more sophisticated in terms of professionalizing its operations. Creating subcommittees is a good practice for effective decision making and proposal creation. But the introduction of numerous subcommittees can also create unnecessary overlap in jobs. In our eyes, the functions of the ARDP and ARDC have enough overlap to justify combining them to an extent in the long run. Either way, they’ll need to be in close communication. A natural point for something like the ARDP would be to create frameworks based on the interactions they have during their tenure, this way the frameworks are empirically designed. But that’s likely too much to ask for. To establish strong frameworks there should be a dedicated task force like the ARDP, but the current six month timeline, along with the corresponding compensation package, should be limited to 6 months and not subject to an automatic reelection period. Unlike the ARDC, which is more-so a continual program, the ARDP can likely accomplish its tasks within the 6 month period. The hard part about creating these frameworks is the initial stage. Afterwards, it’s about monitoring and revamping current frameworks. Therefore, this committee should be ascribed a passive role long-term. In its passive state, the ARDP should also begin resorting to the ARDC and the DAO for continual feedback. We believe it’s fine for the working group to be limited to 3 competent people, but during the passive lifetime of the ARDP after the initial 6 months, it may be a good idea to add more members to the team. Again, this later stage ARDP is mostly a monitoring committee.",16

We are in support of the Long Term Incentives Pilot Program as its structured approach to enhancing the Arbitrum ecosystem takes into account much of the negative feedback from prior proposals and finds a nice common ground between many different opinions. The program addresses key issues from STIP Round 1, like delegate workload and feedback for protocols, and offers a more streamlined and equitable process. The introduction of a council for application evaluation and Application Advisors for feedback ensures a more fair and efficient selection of deserving protocols. This structure promises a more transparent and balanced allocation of resources.
Opting for the smaller 25 million ARB option is prudent for several reasons. It allows for a cautious approach to gauge the effectiveness of the new system without overcommitting resources. Starting smaller provides a controlled environment to test the new incentive structures and make adjustments based on real-world trial outcomes. This conservative start can lead to more informed decisions in scaling up the program in the future, ensuring the long-term sustainability and success of the initiative.

Vote: For
Type: Snapshot
We believe that one predominant way by which DAOs mature and become sustainable organizations is by establishing a strong runway in the form of a diversified portfolio of assets. Selling off $ARB tokens for ensuring Arbitrum’s future success is an important financing lever. So far, most initiatives that we’ve seen in the past year have revolved around grants. These initiatives are important, but they should be balanced by making sure the protocol remains sustainable with a multi-year horizon.
The forum post raises good points around having a clear and informed roadmap for how the treasury will be deployed. The DAO is, in the short term, not strapped for cash. There’s no immediate need to cover particular expenses, so one could argue that it’s worth waiting before the DAO sells off ARB for RWAs. The best time to reduce native token exposure is when the markets are most frothy. This way, during the bull market, ARB can be sold at a higher price, and those reserves can be rotated into RWAs since stable assets are best held onto during drawdowns. This particular proposal acts simply as a pilot program, so it’s important to highlight that the diversification effort won’t happen immediately–it’s using an insignificant amount of capital relative to the entire DAO treasury. The sourcing component of this proposal is therefore most compelling to us. We’d rather have the DAO be in a position to buy and sell assets effectively, even if the bulk of that diversification effort will occur later on.",22

Generally speaking, community management is not an easy task, and the allotted compensation to these contributors seems reasonable–the reduction of the ARB distribution should make this easier to pass at the onchain stage. The transparency in who contributed to the community efforts is also appreciated. Previously, we stated that “as far as where this proposal is in its current state, it doesn’t seem to sufficiently outline the details behind who will be distributed the stated $ARB rewards. Since there seems to be a cap of 25 recipients, it would be best to first outline those names explicitly for transparency purposes BEFORE going forward with a vote.” V2 addresses these concerns to a degree.

We voted against this proposal because it doesn’t seem befitting to request funding directly through the DAO on a one-off basis.
The game looks pretty cool. Seems like an interesting initiative that likely would’ve been funded by Questbook. From reading over the forums, it seems that “Ali was the first founder to apply AFTER the Gaming Domain was fully allocated and as a result was not able to funded in the first round of Questbook grants.” So, this proposal seems to be an attempt at attaining funding from the DAO since the grant program ran out of allocations. Although the DAO could give case-by-case funding exemptions, we believe that this practice is very much a slippery slope. To preserve a standard for the DAO, regardless of the degree of promise presented by a project, the developing team should seek alternative forms of funding apart from the DAO. It seems thechaingamer.eth is now looking to create a developer grant framework for games, which to us, is a much more promising endeavor. This would reduce the DAO’s overall overhead, prevent bias toward individual project selection, and create a standardized structure for project evaluation.

Vote: For
Type: Snapshot
We voted FOR this proposal. The UADP is excited to see the maturation of Plurality Labs from its acquisition by ThriveCoin. The Plurality team should now have more bandwidth to address some of the issues that they previously ran into, such as communications.
“We funded 250+ projects, and spurred movement all over the DAO. But we didn’t document our work and value well”
“Our bias was for action. We cared about creating value and learning - and put blinders on for everything else. We should have hired a Marketing or Comms person.”
“There seems to be wide agreement that we created value but need to scale, document, and showcase.”
One of the most important aspects of any grant program, working group, or sub-DAO is relaying information to the stakeholder who initially entrusted you with a particular task and set of capital. In this instance, we are appreciative of Plurality’s work and effort that has gone into providing resources for numerous projects.
Another aspect that we’re fans of is the funding of grant programs upon reaching particular milestones. This will allow for funds to be disseminated in a more calculated manner–it’s important to double down on the success stories and move on from defunct projects. As mentioned by a couple of other folks, we would like to see some general KPIs implemented for tracking the continual progression of a project–these can be a mix of both qualitative and quantitative metrics. They can also be done on an ad hoc basis since each grant may be unique.
ARDC Research Member Election
Vote: Blockworks/Delphi Digital
Type: Snapshot
Blockworks Research and Delphi Digital are exemplary candidates for the ARDC Research member role. Both entities demonstrate their mastery in dissecting the complex Arbitrum and Ethereum ecosystems through comprehensive reports and technical evaluations. For instance, Blockworks Research’s analytical deep dives into Arbitrum’s staking proposal and Delphi Digital’s early insights into Ethereum’s scaling solutions underscore their capability to navigate and elucidate sophisticated blockchain mechanisms.
Out of the two groups, we’re more intimately familiar with the Blockworks folks due to their historical involvement with Arbitrum. We look forward to seeing research groups like Delphi follow suit.
ARDC DAO Advocate Election
Vote: L2BEAT/Ant Federation
Type: Snapshot
Krzysztof and DK have been active community members, continually providing input into various discussions and acting in the best interest of the Arbitrum DAO. Therefore, we believe that L2Beat and Ant Federation are a strong group to act as the oversight committee/liaison between the ARDC and the DAO.
ARDC Security Member Election
Vote: OpenZeppelin & Trail of Bits
Type: Snapshot
Both Jun and I have been involved in the Compound DAO for the past few years, and OpenZeppelin is the DAO’s go-to security provider. Due to our familiarity with them and direct interactions with their work, we have given them 50% of our votes. The other 50% goes to Trail of Bits, another group that we’ve seen continually deliver via direct work with various protocols as well as their tools like Slither for contract vulnerability detection.
ARDC Risk Member Election
Vote: Elect Chaos Labs
Type: Snapshot
Chaos Labs has a strong background in assisting DAOs like Aave and GMX with risk assessment. We believe that extending this role to Arbitrum would serve to be beneficial. They’ve published various data-driven analyses in the past, and their CEO is already a part of the Security Council, making their organization an apt candidate.
[Non-Emergency Action] Fix Fee Oversight ArbOS v20 “Atlas”
Vote: Choice 1 as “Set L1 surplus fee and L2 min”
Type: Snapshot
We voted with the above decision since by aligning Arbitrum’s fee structure with these enhancements, the network can support increased transaction throughput while reducing costs for users, which is critical for maintaining Arbitrum’s appeal in a competitive Layer 2 landscape. Sure, we’ll see a revenue decrease, but that’s a needed sacrifice to make sure Arbitrum is able to price compete. The hope is that higher volume compensates for lower marginal revenues, thereby returning total revenue to its previous level–and ideally beyond that.",25

Request for Continuation of the Arbitrum DDA Program Request
Vote: For
Type: Snapshot
The UADP is supporting this proposal since we believe that continuation of this grants program will have an overall net benefit to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Since the program is in its second inning, we believe that the experience garnered by the four domain allocators will serve to be valuable for funding future projects. The budget increase also seems reasonable since there is clear demand for these grants, as highlighted the other week by @thechaingamer.eth–Machinata had to turn directly to the DAO to request funds for their game since the Questbook budget ran its course. Reporting from this program has also been better than other grant programs that we’ve reviewed across other DAOs. We’ve appreciated the disclosure of txns, PPTS, and reports produced by @JoJo, @cattin, @Juandi and @Flook.
This question is more for Questbook–is there a plan to do a retroactive analysis of the impact produced by these grant programs? We have disclosure reports, but going through and assessing which projects have succeeded would be helpful. A VC fund for instance would typically look at ROI, and of the funded projects, only a minority really succeed. Grant success is likely the same. Perhaps later on an analysis can be done regarding volume driven, sticky TVL, increase in user base, etc around the projects. Each domain will have its unique KPIs. This would be something to consider at the termination of this grant program and would allow us to make a more informed decision on whether to continue such grants in the future.
[Non-Constitutional AIP] Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime
Vote: For
Type: Snapshot
The UADP strongly endorses this initiative proposed by WakeUp Labs for creating a front-end interface that enables direct L1 transaction submissions during Arbitrum Sequencer downtimes. This solution enhances the network’s resilience, allowing users to continue their transactions uninterrupted, and will be a big help to non devs during downtimes.
Overall, the expertise and track record of WakeUp Labs in delivering these blockchain solutions are extensive and we believe ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the project. This proposal not only bolsters the network’s operational ease but also will ensure no temporary “mass drama” when systems inevitably go down for a time.",26

Snapshot Votes
Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program
Vote: FOR
We believe it is important for the Arbitrum DAO to diversify its treasury. Arbitrum’s $6B treasury is one of it’s most competitive assets. If managed properly the treasury can sustainably fund ongoing DAO operations, offer builders the resources they need to attract users, and serve as a means of bootstrapping DeFi liquidity.
This is a well thought out proposal which will help aid in both diversifying the treasury and attracting DeFi projects via liquidity. We are excited to support this proposal and future treasury diversification proposals.
ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas”
Vote: FOR
EIP-4844 has been a big piece of the excitement around ETH L2’s. It offers the possibility for gas costs on Arbitrum to get reduced even more and may allow for increased sequencer fees. We are excited for what this will help enable when implemented.
Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix
Vote: FOR
OpSec is an important part of crypto and hacks are too common. Any kind of irreversible hack to the Arbitrum protocol could be catastrophic for it’s long-term adoption. We appreciate this proposal’s efforts to reduce the security risk of Arbitrum by creating a “batch poster manager”.
Empowering Early Contributors
Vote: ABSTAIN
While we do believe it is important to empower and reward early contributors, it can be a tricky balance deciding who does and does not deserve rewards.

If the community values their inputs and opts to rewards these individuals, we support that decision.

Long Term Incentives Pilot Program

Incentives are a core piece of an ecosystem’s ability to grow. It is important for the Arbitrum DAO to deploy their treasury to help ecosystem projects in a responsible fashion. The LTIP is a step in the right direction for getting ongoing project incentives in place, that will rewards developers for coming to Arbitrum.
We encourage the DAO to maintain an analytical approach to their incentive programs, as we learn from these experiments and create positive ROI systems. We hope the committee in charge of LTIP takes time to learn from the STIP program and hones in on long-term value generative incentives for Arbitrum.",1

Funding for Into the Dungeons
Vote: AGAINST
This is a major funding proposal and would be the first time the Arbitrum DAO gave a grant directly to a project. The proposal additionally is asking for the funds to be used for development rather than user incentives or other activity that will directly benefit the DAO. While we understand the importance of helping fund builders, we believe this proposal is a bit premature and would set a bad precedent for project funding.
We would encourage the DAO to continue developing a program to provide funding for gaming projects. It is becoming fairly clear that many of the funding streams are built primarily for the DeFi project lifecycle and gaming projects are struggling to get funding from the DAO. If Arbitrum wants to be competitive in gaming it will need to continue to work with gaming builders.

We collaborated with Trail of Bits on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal and feel strongly about their quality of their work and understanding of the Arbitrum DAO.

It is important for builders to have multiple streams to which they can apply for funding. This enables specialization around different funding types as well as increased likelihood of success in winning developers to the Arbitrum ecosystem.

ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas”
Vote: For
I am really excited to see the development around EIP-4844 and am optimistic about the impact this proposal will have on the long-term adoption of Arbitrum. While many chains have been talking about the positive impact of 4844, Arbitrum is leading the charge in terms of implementation. This is a big step that can both reduce gas costs and improve the profitability of the protocol.
Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix
Vote: FOR
This is a great step from the DAO at improving the safety of Arbitrum and decentralizing operations. I am pleased with the simplicity and elegance of this proposal at addressing a clear problem for the protocol’s security. With other major chains having suffered hacks from compromised wallets, it is great we are able to proactively make this change and not risk having Arbitrum reach the same fate.
Empowering Early Contributors
Vote: ABSTAIN
I am in favor of early contributors getting compensated, but also worry about where/how to draw the line. Abritrum is now quite large and has an abundance of contributors, while we would not have gotten here without the early contributors, we need to focus on how to retain and empower the contributors we currently have.
I am not personally familiar with this contributors actions, so I opted to Abstain. If the community values the contributions that is okay. If this becomes a funding strategy the community wants to lean on more, I would encourage them to create a scalable program more akin to Optimism’s RPGF vs. doing one off payments.
Funding for Into the Dungeons
Vote: AGAINST
Arbitrum needs to figure out how to build a gaming ecosystem, but I am worried that this proposal may cause more delays in rolling out larger, more scalable programs for the rest of the community. This proposal favors a single project and does not result in any user incentives. While there may be merit this structure of funding, the DAO will likely want to monitor it’s performance before continuing with similar programs for other projects. This gives an unfair advantage to this project, as well as risks the DAO deciding not to fund other games.
I would encourage the community to work on a dedicate funding track for games, which can be easily scaled and monitored moving forward.
Tally Votes
Long Term Incentives Pilot Program
Vote: FOR
Arbitrum is at risk of losing new developers and users to emerging ecosystems, which have recently launched tokens and fresh incentive pools.

I encourage the LTIP council to focus on developing a data-driven methodology that can result in positive ROI for the DAO.

There are many great auditing firms, which made it hard to narrow down. The quality of applicants speaks to the success of the original ARDC proposal in scoping for security firms. Zellic took this even further by including a wide range of specific services, which seem highly valuable to the DAO. I would be keen to see more proposals in this form for service providers. Halborn and OpenZeppelin had slightly more cost effective proposals for the DAO and do great work in other ecosystems. I believe this range of options from great firms is a big success for DAO selection processes.

In ideal circumstances, we would recommend applying with a proposal like this in a grants program.

[Snapshot] AIP-1.05: Return 700m ARB to DAO Treasury
Summary: This proposal seeks to do several things:

Return 700 million tokens.
Conduct a buyback with proceeds from the unauthorized token sale.
Disclose terms to a nonpublic agreement with Wintermute.
Pause AIP-1.1 and AIP-1.2.

Recommendation: Vote Abstain.
GFX strongly supports the first goal. 700m+ is a needlessly large budget for the newly created Foundation. We fully favor the 700m being returned to the DAO, which still leaves the Foundation with significant funds to utilize, given the Foundation can always request additional funds at a future date.
We’re voting to abstain because we generally agree with the proposal’s intention. However, a buyback at this stage is unnecessary. Additionally, the market-making agreement between Wintermute and the Foundation isn’t significant to the proposal’s objective.",1

[Snapshot] AIP-1.1: Lockup, Budget, Transparency
Summary: This proposal seeks to instruct the Arbitrum Foundation to place 700,000,000 ARB into a smart contract for a 4-year, linearly vesting lockup. It also authorizes a $36,000,000/year budget for the Foundation’s operating, legal, research, and technical expenses.
Recommendation: Vote No. This is a very large budget, and no clear justification for it. The Foundation has also already chosen to engage with DAO service providers, but not disclosed who they are or the terms. We would be much more comfortable with a smaller budget to begin, and then the Foundation can return every quarter or six months to request authorization for further spending. This ensures the Foundation can be held accountable, particularly given the small number of board seats, paucity of data on who it is paying and for what services, and the directors’ fiduciary responsibility being exclusively to the Foundation itself and not to tokenholders.
[Snapshot] AIP-1.2: Foundation and DAO Governance
Summary: This proposal seeks to amend the Arbitrum Constitution, the Foundation bylaws, and memorandum of association for the Foundation. Changes are largely confined to clarifying language, removing references to AIP-1 (which did not pass), lowering the proposal threshold from 5,000,000 ARB to 1,000,000 ARB, and more details about the Data Availability Committee for Arbitrum One.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. These changes are largely housekeeping, with the most notable change being a lowering of the threshold to propose, which we support.",4

Fund the Arbitrum Grants Framework - Milestone 1
Summary: This poll requests input from ARB holders on whether to advance this proposal to an on-chain vote on Tally. Broadly speaking, this would allocate 3.971 ARB to a grants program overseen by Plurality Labs.
Recommendation: Vote No. The concept of this program is admirable, but it essentially adopts a diversified way of distributing grants – a council, a more decentralized approach, and through matching funds on Gitcoin. This means that the fixed drawbacks (operationally, reputationally, and for efficiency) of all three methods come into play without realizing the benefits that largely grow with scaling a grants program. Particularly with competing grants program proposals public or soon to be made public, this proposal seems like it could be stronger with a clear focus on both methodology and in specific grant categories. Also, most of the contributors are already selected via the proposal rather than being elected, so to vote Yes, we would need to be convinced of both the methodology and the contributors being the ideal choice.

Summary: This AIP would activate on One and Nova mainnets RPC endpoints that support EIP-4337 account abstraction. This upgrade has already been made to One and Nova testnets. There are no costs associated with this upgrade, since Offchain Labs has already performed the relevant work.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. This change keeps Arbitrum and Nova aligned technically with Ethereum, and a similar upgrade is also being explored by OP Labs.",5

Accelerating Arbitrum - Leveraging Camelot as an Ecosystem Hub to Support Native Builders
Summary: This proposal seeks to grant Camelot DEX 1,500,000 ARB per month for 6 month, earmarked for a variety of liquidity incentives.
Recommendation: Vote No. Camelot spends time comparing this request to the grant(s) that Velodrome got on Optimism. In hindsight – and the continuing grant requests by Velodrome on Optimism – it’s not clear that the Velodrome grant cited has produced unambiguous value for Optimism. More specifically, it’s unclear whether subsidizing incentives on Camelot would increase the number of users or assets interacting with Arbitrum.
Additionally, we feel Arbitrum governance should not get into the habit of supporting protocols that are already engaged in healthy competition in a robust market. Camelot is only one DEX on Arbitrum, and subsidization of a profit-seeking protocol is most appropriate if it provides a service otherwise unavailable, or if a grant plan very clearly provides a path to onboarding protocols, users, or assets to Arbitrum. That is not present in this proposal, and the administrative aspects need far more detail.
There are already several grants programs already being proposed. There is a limit to how many are required, and governance will probably have difficulty providing proper oversight, given how unstructured the two that have already passed Snapshot have been.
As a final note, we would ask that all grants proposers include the following:

Clearly state that team wallets will be excluded from any rewards and reported metrics.
Clearly disclose any relationships that would likely result in financial gain. An example would be serving as (or having ownership interest in an entity that is serving as) a paid consultant for grant applicants while also serving on a grant-giving body.
Provide or require clear, unambiguous milestones for any grant plan, with an easy method for Arbitrum governance to claw back funds or not disburse subsequent tranches of a grant.

Update Security Council Election Start Date to Ensure Time for Security Audit
Summary: This offchain poll asks ARB holders whether to support an amendment to the ArbitrumDAO Constitution. This change would alter the election schedule of Security Council members. The relevant change is from the election beginning September 15th, to September 15th or the earliest possible date an onchain election can begin.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. This change is necessary to prevent conflict between a hardcoded constitutional requirement and practicality. In practice, there are several intermediate steps that may not take an exact amount of time, owing to the nature of smart contracts, permissionless calling of functions, and human error. In practice, Security Council terms are not a set period of time, but a minimum period of time that comes to an end when someone calls for a new election. Because of this, the proposed change harmonizes reality with the constitution.",7

Summary: This proposal establishes the technical implementation of the Arbitrum Security Council and its elections calendar. Full details can be found here.

Some minor changes have been made since its original outline in the Arbitrum Constitution, mainly around some minor technical points. An example is elections occurring no earlier than every 6 months vs no later than every 6 months, since the function to initiate the process is permissionless and there is no guarantee it would be called exactly at 6 months.",9

While there are some risks, namely a delay attack vector, that could be introduced by adding Matrixed.Link as a validator, as pointed out by Blockworks. However, Matrix.Linked has already secured large TVLs through its work with Chainlink feeds, and the risk of Matrixed.Link either acting maliciously (at cost) or being compromised seems low given their history of successfully operating infrastructure for other projects.",10

Recommendation: Vote Yes. Rarible has an identifiable brand/platform in the NFT industry.

Historically, bringing many grant proposals to a delegate-wide vote has not resulted in prudent spending (Optimism’s early grants are an excellent example). Realistically, most will receive de minimis review and likely be approved. We recognize, however, that there is a strong desire in the community to do something and this is something.

Summary: This proposal authorizes 127,351 ARB to subsidize Rarible supporting Arbitrum. 50% would be payable upon passage of this proposal, with the remainder at completion.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is a relatively small amount of ARB, and while we don’t feel it will really require the stated cost for Rarible to support Arbitrum, the potential to introduce new users and assets to Arbitrum makes this worth funding.
Arbitrum as official sponsor of Ethereum Mexico 2023
Summary: This poll seeks to gauge ARB holder support to use 9,483 ARB to sponsor Ethereum Mexico. Details of the milestones, deliverables, timeline, etc can be found on the original post.

While we don’t think this will result in any new users, assets, or developers interacting with Arbitrum, it will likely make the Arbitrum community feel positively about supporting Ethereum Mexico.

IMPORTANT: A limited amount of time to review often results in suboptimal approvals of grants. GFX Labs has reviewed hundreds of grants, which received more than one hundred million of dollars in the past. The STIP process is not optimized for providing time for applicants to craft quality proposals, or for reviewers to do any significant level of diligence or evaluation. Therefore, we wish both delegates and applicants to be charitable and kind with each other, as we are all operating in a process that encourages mistakes to be made.
GFX Labs has adopted a relatively conservative stance to grants approvals, partly owing to the requirement that all grants run simultaneously. This makes some grants, which in isolation would be desirable, compete with each other, and do so at Arbitrum governance’s expense.
We will post a retrospective on the STIP process in the coming days, and constructive criticism on how to avoid creating an environment that disadvantages both applicants and reviewers in the future.
UniDex
Summary: 750,000 ARB to UniDex to incentivize or provide slippage protection.
Recommendation: Vote No. This protocol has only $1.5m TVL according to DefiLlama, with only $270k on Arbitrum. While it may be useful as an aggregator for spot and perps trading, it just doesn’t seem like a good use of ARB in a crowded field.
Good Entry
Summary: 200,000 ARB to Good Entry to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. Good Entry offers leveraged trading on top of Uniswap V3. While Good Entry has a TVL on Arbitrum of only $1m, it is a new protocol and its TVL has remained steady. The requested amount is a bit high, but we’re willing to support since it is built on top of a key piece of the Arbitrum economy (Uniswap).
IZUMi
Summary: 200,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. This protocol has only ~$1.5m TVL according to DefiLlama. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Synapse Protocol
Summary: 2,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. Synapse still has more than 1m ARB it received in the initial airdrop, so does not require ARB to fund user incentives.

Sanko GameCorp
Summary: 500,000 ARB to incentivize viewership.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. The amount requested is high and we are not familiar with the applicant’s past work or track record beyond what a cursory search shows. That being said, the grant is at least moderately tailored to appeal to users that may not already be onboarded into Arbitrum
Wombat Exchange
Summary: 750,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. Half of this amount is intended to incentivize Wombat’s cross-chain swaps/pools. That helps connect the Arbitrum economy to other chains, such as Binance and L2s. More commerce between chains is a net positive, and it also exposes new users to Arbitrum and lowers the friction for them to move assets to the chain via swaps.

Recommendation: Vote Abstain. Onboarding new users for onchain options is the first stated goal of the grant plan. We are unfamiliar with the applicant, however, and have not performed diligence given the compressed timeline for voting on these proposals. The grant request is also several times the entire Arbitrum TVL of the protocol.
PancakeSwap
Summary: 200,000 ARB to incentivize usage.

Beefy
Summary: 900,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. A stated goal of the grant is to incentivize Beefy’s existing user base on other chains to bring assets to Arbitrum. Beefy has users on a large number of chains, including several where it has a bigger footprint than Arbitrum.
TimeSwap
Summary: 200,000 ARB to incentivize usage.

QiDAO
Summary: 500,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. While there is not an obvious attempt to migrate or attract users to Arbitrum that are not already present, a deep, competitive stablecoin market is important for the Arbitrum economy to prioritize. The grant size, while not small, is also considerably more modest than many others.
DeFi Edge
Summary: 200,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum. The requested amount is also a significant percentage of the current TVL on Arbitrum.

Recommendation: Vote Yes. A stated goal is to onboard users of their centralized products onto Arbitrum. Given time constraints to review, no significant diligence on WOOfi was performed in making this recommendation.
Quadrat
Summary: 1,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
CVI
Summary: 200,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Artichoke Protocol
Summary: 370,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
HMX
Summary: 750,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Gamma
Summary: 750,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. While there is not an obvious attempt to migrate or attract users to Arbitrum that are not already present, Gamma has a significant active user base on a number of competing chains that will be alerted to these incentives.
Perennial Finance
Summary: 750,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. The grant plan has a stated goal of “bringing new users, projects, and developers to Arbitrum,” which is what we view as the primary reason to offer grants.
Wormhole
Summary: 1,800,000 ARB to incentivize migration of USDC to Arbitrum.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. A deep, competitive stablecoin market is important for the Arbitrum economy to prioritize. Wormhole has a significant active user base on a number of competing chains that will be alerted to these incentives. As a secondary effect, this will help the Arbitrum ecosystem begin to migrate from bridged USDC to Circle-minted, native USDC, which would be facilitated by Wormhole. GFX Labs advised the Wormhole Foundation on this grant plan.
Angle Protocol
Summary: 700,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. A deep, competitive stablecoin market is important for the Arbitrum economy to prioritize. Angle also provides a stable denominated in non-USD, which offers the opportunity for activities centered on euro stables to concentrate on Arbitrum.
OmniBTC
Summary: 200,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. The grant will subsidize bridging new assets to Arbitrum.
Magpie, Penpie, Radpie, Campie
Summary: 1,250,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Galxe
Summary: 500,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. A stated goal of the grant plan is to onboard new users and increase community participation. While it’s not clear how Galxe will onboard new users, its core product is often used to increase the intensity and frequency of community interactions.
Solv Protocol
Summary: 150,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Realm
Summary: 300,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum. We would have preferred to see a focus on new user acquisition for the Realm gaming ecosystem.
Wombex
Summary: 200,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum. We do appreciate the stated goal of increasing user activity, but it’s not clear from the grant how the funds would achieve that goal specifically.
dForce
Summary: 1,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Relay Chain: James Bot
Summary: 400,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. This product is not live on Arbitrum.
Equilibria
Summary: 750,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Balancer
Summary: 1,200,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. While there is not an explicit focus on migrating users and assets to Arbitrum, Balancer has a large following and user base on other chains, who presumably will be exposed to the existence of these incentives and migrate some of their assets to Arbitrum.
Arrakis
Summary: 806,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Abstain. Arrakis is a well-known protocol, but the TVL on Arbitrum is less than $2m, which makes this grant size quite large. The majority of its users on Ethereum are also utilizing inexpensive leverage from MakerDAO that’s not available on Arbitrum, so it’s unclear how many of those users would be responsive to migrating assets to Arbitrum.
tBTC
Summary: 750,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. This is simply a large grant considering the ~$3m of tBTC currently on Arbitrum. Given time to prepare a grant plan tailored to sourcing new users and migrating them to Arbitrum, we would support seeing Threshold seek a grant in the future.
Vela Exchange
Summary: 1,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Socket
Summary: 1,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. Socket is a cross-chain protocol, and the stated goal of the grant plan is to drive usage onto the various Arbitrum chains. Socket has become well-known in the L2 space, and has a good reputation.
Lido
Summary: 4,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Abstain. This is a very large grant request, and directed at one of the few crypto assets to have already found extensive product-market fit. It’s difficult to see how this can meaningfully increase liquidity for wstETH on Arbitrum. We do support that outcome, but subsidizing an already successful product is difficult – at some point you’re just pushing on a string.
Stargate Finance
Summary: 2,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. Stargate still has 1.5m ARB from its initial airdrop, which it hasn’t used.
MUX Protocol
Summary: 6,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Tally
Summary: 200,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is targeted at growing the number of DAOs on Arbitrum and using onchain governance.
Dopex
Summary: 1,500,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. A stated goal of the grant plan is to onboard new users. We wish there was more clarity about how that will be done, but given the time constraints when writing these grant plans, that’s perhaps to be expected.
GMX
Summary: 14,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. This is just too large a proportion of the total ARB available for this grants wave.
Prime Protocol
Summary: 300,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Lodestar Finance
Summary: 750,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
KeplarHomes
Summary: 960,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
LogX
Summary: 750,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Range Protocol
Summary: 450,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Frax Finance
Summary: 1,500,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. Frax’s suite of products – with FRAX and Frax ETH in particular - provide important infrastructure for the economy of Arbitrum. This grant plan is intended to use Frax’s large existing user base and community to migrate more of those assets to Arbitrum, creating deeper liquidity in the stablecoin market and increase the capital flowing to the chain with Frax’s yield-bearing asset (staked ETH). GFX Labs advised Frax Finance on this grant plan.
Abracadabra
Summary: 1,500,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum. We would have preferred to see an emphasis on Abracadabra encouraging its user base on other chains to give Arbtirum a try.
Umami
Summary: 750,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Webacy
Summary: 812,600 to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. While this grant plan does not explicitly attempt to onboard new users to Arbitrum, making wallet security products available is akin to vaccination. It makes everyone safer when even some people use the product. Making Arbitrum a less inviting target for malicious actors, even by a modicum, is worth this grant. Wallets with assets the size of this grant request are drained every week (or maybe even every day) across DeFi.
Chronos Finance
Summary: 525,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
OpenOcean
Summary: 500,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. This grant plan includes subsidizing cross chain asset swaps, making Arbitrum more interconnected to other crypto ecosystems. That makes it easier for new users to find and use Arbitrum.
Cryptex
Summary: 1,300,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Florence Finance
Summary: 250,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Abstain. In theory, any RWA protocol is by definition onboarding new users and assets to Arbitrum – and importing capital to the chain by paying interest. We’re not familiar with Florence, though, and have had a front row seat to how complex RWA implementation can be. So we support this conceptually, but feel much more diligence would be needed before disbursing a grant.
0xGen
Summary: 250,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. 0xGen is a cross-chain liquidity aggregator. Cross-chain commerce introduces new users and assets to Arbitrum.
Stella
Summary: 186,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Notional Finance
Summary: 500,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. While this proposal doesn’t explicitly attempt to onboard new users, Notional dominates the fixed lending vertical on Ethereum, and this is an opportunity to build that functionality out on Arbitrum, while the incentives will be advertised to Notional’s existing user base.
Gains Network
Summary: 7,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Tide Protocol
Summary: 80,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Trader Joe
Summary: 1,510,000 ARB to incentivize usage and onboarding new protocols to Arbitrum.
Recommendation: Vote Abstain. This grant request is not a small sum. It does, however, stand out for emphasis on bringing new protocols and developers to Arbitrum and providing incentives for some cross-chain activities. Unfortunately, those are not the majority of the grant plan, which makes it hard to support, since it would direct ARB inwards to users and assets already on Arbitrum.
Archi Finance
Summary: 750,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
KyberSwap
Summary: 1,500,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Cian
Summary: 380,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Modular Wallet
Summary: 200,000 ARB to incentivize MOD/ARB liquidity.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Savvy
Summary: 200,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
XY
Summary: 500,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. This grant is to subsidize onboarding new users via XY’s cross chain element. As a reminder, we have not had time or opportunity to diligence this protocol or its team.
Pendle
Summary: 2,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. While this proposal doesn’t explicitly attempt to onboard new users, Pendle has a broad user base on other chains that these incentives will be advertised to, and seems likely to generate some user or asset migration.
Ramses
Summary: 1,248,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Abstain. This grant request is large. It does, however, have a goal of bringing new protocols and developers to Arbitrum. Unfortunately, those are not the majority of the grant plan, which makes it hard to support, since it would direct ARB inwards to users and assets already on Arbitrum.
Shell
Summary: 750,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.

Summary: 133,700 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.

Summary: 375,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Premia
Summary: 900,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
RabbitHole
Summary: 1,000,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. While this proposal doesn’t explicitly attempt to onboard new users, this is to incentivize quests on Arbitrum, which are a widely used method of increasing community engagement and user acquisition.
ArbiDEX
Summary: 240,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.
Radiant Capital
Summary: 2,852,044 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. While this proposal doesn’t explicitly attempt to onboard new users, Radiant’s niche is cross-chain money market.

Summary: 500,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote No. While it may be useful, this grant looks like it would only spend DAO funds to compete with other liquidity programs on Arbitrum, with no clear focus on onboarding new users or assets to Arbitrum.

Summary: 500,000 ARB to incentivize usage.

Tales of Elleria
Summary: 50,000 ARB to incentivize usage.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. Gaming is a potential route to onboard new users. We’re not familiar with this game company, but the amount requested is small, so it’s acceptable to take a risk on this grant plan.",20

Summary: Tokenholders are asked to vote for up to five choices to hold seats on the Arbitrum Security Council.
Recommendation: Vote Pablito.eth, Harry Kalodner, Phillip Jovanic, Emiliano Bonassi, Matt Fiebach
Briefly, what made each candidate stand out to use:
Pablito is a career cybersecurity professional, including on blockchain.
Harry Kalodner is the Chief Technology Officer of the DevCo that built Arbitrum.
Phillip Jovanic is a professor of Information Security at University College London and has cybersecurity experience in both academia and the private sector.
Emiliano Bonassi is a security researcher who has identified security issues or assisted in war rooms at protocols such as Yearn, Convex, and Aura.

Empowering Early Contributors: The Community Arbiter Proposal
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders whether they support giving 20,000 ARB each to 25 early contributors. This document provides loose guidelines on what may trigger payment.
Recommendation: Vote Abstain. This would benefit from a list of the exact 25 recipients and what contribution merits 20,000 ARB. The amounts and concept are good, but we can’t vote for just sending money to 25 someones. We would vote in favor with this list.

Activate ARB Staking
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders whether they support creating a staking mechanism for ARB. ARB would be staked for 365-day periods, with a penalty for early unlock. Staked ARB would earn yield in the form of additional ARB, with a suggestion of 1.25% of total supply being distributed annually (125,000,000 ARB). Additional options are available for voting:
Fund with 100,000,000 ARB
Fund with 125,000,000 ARB
Fund with 150,000,000 ARB
Fund with 175,000,000 ARB
Do not fund staking
Recommendation: Vote Do Not Fund Staking. There are many good reasons to fund staking. Yield is one of them. However, all yield would come through dilution of existing ARB holders, since there’s not a large stream of revenue to distribute.
Build Optimal Onboarding For STIP Teams
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders whether they support 1,000,000 ARB tokens to fund quests for users of STIP-approved protocols.
Recommendation: Vote No. We’re leery of approving more funds when the 50,000,000 ARB of the STIP program has not yet begun to be digested by markets. Also, there is not robust oversight of this program, relying upon “Should we fall short of fulfilling our obligations at any point within the specified period, a new proposal can be initiated to stop the stream of funds.”",22

Proposal to Backfund Successful STIP Proposals
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders whether they support allocating an additional 21,400,000 ARB to fund projects that were approved under STIP, but were not provided a grant due to a funding gap.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. The STIP process was not something we were in favor of, nor do we feel it went well. However, Arbitrum actively solicited proposals and went on to approve more than were provided for under the initial 50m ARB allocation. While we feel spending is rapidly approaching an unsustainable rate at Arbitrum, this proposal would simply fund projects that were already approved. It is important for Arbitrum to live up to commitments it made to projects it approved for grants funding. Additionally, given the non-prohibition on protocols voting to approve their own funding, many projects that were approved were only de-prioritized because they are not incumbents who were able to vote with previous grants and airdrops. As a result, we vote yes on this proposal.",24

Summary: This poll asks ARB holders if they support allocating 1,500,000 ARB to Rage Trade to fund trading incentives and gas rebates to run concurrently with STIP grants.
Recommendation: Vote No. We do not feel gas costs are a factor in Arbitrum activity, and also would prefer not to see trading incentives bundled into the same proposal. We are also not familiar with Rage Trade, which has a TVL smaller than the requested grant (according to DeFi Llama).",25

Procurement Framework | Security : Non-Constitutional Proposal
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders if they support this procedural framework for security vendor procurement.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. Inevitably, some portion of this will need to be revised – no process is ever perfect right out of the gate. But the structure this framework provides for purchasing services is a considerable improvement over a free-for-all on the forums by competing providers. Crucially, this framework begins with a needs assessment to identify what needs to be done, and only then proceeds to solicit proposals from vendors. We fully support this proposal as directionally correct, and also like that it does not attempt to lock in the persons responsible for administering this important process. Those parties will be determined after this framework has been adopted.",27

Summary: This poll asks ARB holders if they support altering the latest date for STIP grant usage to March 31, 2023 (currently January 31, 2023). This would apply to backfunded STIP grants as well.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is a commonsense amendment to the STIP program, particularly in light of the funding for previously approved proposals. Without this or another extension, grantees just now receiving funds would have 4 to 6 weeks to utilize their grants.",28

Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders if they support funding an Arbitrum R&D Collective. This is a similar proposal to an earlier one made by Blockworks, Trail of Bits, and Gauntlet, but with elections for each position to occur later. The choices for voters are:
Fund with 880,000 ARB
Fund with 1,300,000 ARB
Fund with 1,715,000 ARB
Don’t fund
Abstain
NB: This is a ranked choice vote.
Recommendation: Vote Don’t Fund, Abstain. The proposal lacks clearly bounded, objective deliverables in its mandate. The overarching goal is to provide expert advice to delegates on proposals, but narrowing the scope of what exactly is and is not covered by ARDC member assessments would be more convincing that the ARDC is staffed with highly qualified subject matter experts that opine only in their areas of specialization. The danger here is that the ARDC comes to be seen as the expert on everything, which would centralize governance and probably not lead to high-caliber advice. We recommend more specific, bounded areas of expertise or breaking the ARDC into much more specialized roles.",29

Summary: This poll asks ARB holders if they support the creation of a long-term grants program. The budget would be between 25m and 45m ARB. The program would include creation of several council seats and application advisor positions to be filled by election if the program is approved.

Proposal to Establish Arbitrum Research & Development Collective
Summary: This is essentially a resubmission of a failed initiative from November. The key difference is that the service providers are now elected positions rather than being set by the proposal itself.
Recommendation: Vote No. We actually support this proposal conceptually, and our previous opposition was based on the lack of elections for each seat on this body. We vote No now simply because the budgets were outlined in ARB, which has doubled in market price in the interim. This highlights the need for budgets to be denominated in dollars, even if they are paid in ARB. This critique is not unique to this proposal, and is easily amended to provide stable-value budgets that protect against unintended windfalls or impoverishment for those engaged by governance.
Pilot Program Council Elections
Summary: This is the poll to elect the 5 members of the council to run the Long Term Incentive Pilot Program, which is budgeted to distribute approximately $90m of ARB (45m ARB tokens) over a 12-week period.
Recommendation: Vote GFX Labs.
GFX Labs has experience working on and building high-quality grants programs. We have held a seat on the Optimism Grants Council since its inception, which has reviewed 455 grants and awarded grants of more than 11,000,000 OP during our tenure. GFX also has experience working on some smaller and less well-known grants programs.
There are few candidates with experience running large grants programs, and Arbitrum’s “pilot program” is slated to be one of the largest and shortest grants programs in crypto – or perhaps anywhere. It’s vital that experienced candidates staff the council if anything approaching 45m ARB is going to be granted intelligently over 12 weeks.
NB: Included in the Snapshot is a stipulation for applicants not to vote for themselves. This was not in the original proposal. We will make sure our votes are taken off of ourselves prior to close of the poll, though GFX has a relatively small number of votes (331k) and is incapable of affecting the outcome of this poll.

Summary: This is the poll to elect the 3 advisors to the Long Term Incentive Pilot Program, which is budgeted to distribute approximately $90m of ARB (45m ARB tokens) over a 12-week period.
Recommendation: Vote Abstain. To our reading, advisors are supposed to assist and to some extent advocate for (via recommendations) grant applicants. Because GFX Labs is also running for a seat on the council for this program, we are abstaining to respect the separation of that role and that of the council members.
2 Polls Closing January 24, 2024
Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders if they support changes to the Security Council structure in order to maintain a Stage 1 rating by the watchdog group, L2Beat.
Recommendation: Vote Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days. Consultation with L2Beat representatives confirmed that any action beyond no action would preserve the Stage 1 rating. Of the two options – or their combined implementation – increasing the timelock delay seems more decentralizing and making trustless than simply raising the msig threshold, but also less disruptive than doing both.
Experimental Delegates Incentive System
Summary: This proposal creates a 6-month trial incentive program for Arbitrum delegates with >50k ARB voting power. The budget will provide incentives for up to 50 delegates of the 194 eligible, and requires delegates to opt in during a 2-week period following the initiation of this program.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. We have some reservations about some of the scoring categories - in particular the large (30%) bonus category. That being said, there is no incentive system in place now, and this is only a trial with a non-renewing budget.",31

Election of Procurement Committee Members (ADPC)
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders to select members of the ADPC. There are three seats.
Pavel Fedotov [pfedprog]
Joseph [immutablelawyer]
Jeff G [jeff_g]
Bernard Schmid [bernard]
Paul Imseih [pablo]
Recommendation: Vote Joseph, Bernard, and Jeff G. Joseph (ImmutableLawyer) provides legal background for the committee. Paul does as well, but one lawyer is enough with only three seats available. Jeff G works in US government procurement and has the most directly relevant experience to develop procurement frameworks for governance to consider. Bernard of Areta likewise has procurement/allocation experience from grants program administration.

Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee
Summary: This poll seeks to release funds to and authorize an ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC). This body’s mandate would be to create and oversee procurement frameworks for governance to adopt, including the already approved Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. Someone needs to administer the Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers. This body would do that. Further mandate increases would be subject to proposals drafted and submitted by the ADPC.",32

[Non-Constitutional]: Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders whether they support the creation of a treasury diversification program, with an initial goal of diversifying 35,000,000 ARB into stable-value, yield bearing assets. This program would establish a screening committee to initiate an RFP, and then provide finalists to ARB holders for consideration. ARB holders would determine the final asset allocation (if any) through voting on these finalists.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. GFX Labs would be one of the screening committee members, and we fully support this proposal.
NB: GFX Labs would serve on the screening for this program
1 Poll Closing February 9, 2024
AIP: ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas”
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders whether they support an upgrade to support the anticipated Dencun Ethereum upgrade, allowing Arbitrum stack chains settling on Ethereum to post data as blobs or call data.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. Keeping Arbitrum up to date with the latest capabilities on Ethereum is a positive. We will caution, however, that we will not support this as executable code until audits have been completed and published. At the time of this Snapshot vote, they are still pending.
1 Poll Closing February 12, 2024
AIP: Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders whether they support creating a batch posting manager. This would separate the addresses associated with this new role and the sequencer, which are currently shared. Bundled with this proposal is also a change to the futureBlocks value for the sequencer’s inbox. This proposal would raise the max block height from 12 to 64, which Offchain Labs states is in line with Ethereum’s security guarantees and less likely to result in valid batches reverting.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. The separation of batch posting address and sequencer address makes sense, and Offchain Labs’ argument is convincing that governance can still indirectly control the batch poster while the arrangement improves key rotation and other security options for the management of the role. Separately, the change to futureBlocks appears reasonable, as changing that one parameter alone doesn’t look like it will increase the ability of the sequencer to censor transactions.",33

Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0
Summary: This poll asks if ARB holders support providing 125,000 ARB in retroactive rewards to a group of 25 contributors.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. We previously voted Abstain for the original poll on this subject due to not having a list of these contributors. With the reduced ask to 5k ARB each and a list provided, we vote in favor of rewarding these early contributors.
1 Poll Closing February 15, 2024
Proposal: [Non-Constitutional] Funding for Into the Dungeons: Machinata - a PvP Digital 
Miniature Game V2
Summary: This poll asks if ARB holders if they support granting 180,000 ARB to finish development of Dungeons: Machinata.
Recommendation: Vote No. Milestones are based on inputs (grantee efforts) vs outputs (such as user adoption). While we personally enjoy miniatures and collectible card games with a fantasy theme, this seems beyond the scope of typical governance grants. Rather than focusing on the product, it would be more useful if the grant applicants made their milestones based on metrics that indicate they have onboarded new users to Arbitrum or increased the frequency with which existing users interact with it.",34

Summary: This proposal asks ARB holders to upgrade Arbitrum to allow for batch posting as blobs to lower costs. This proposal also includes upgrading to support the Dencun update for Ethereum. Full details, including associated Github repos, can be found in the proposal copy.
Recommendation: Vote Yes. This has been proposed by Offchain Labs and has undergone auditing and review. Similar upgrades have taken place on other L2s without issue.",35

Summary: This poll asks ARB holders if they wish to renew Plurality Labs’ grants program at substantially the same terms.

Summary: This poll asks ARB holders if they support fixing an error where user fees calculated remained 32 gwei and .1 gwei rather than reduced to 0 and .001 gwei, respectively.
Recommendation: Vote Set L1 Surplus Fee and L2 minimum. This corrects the fee structure for Arbitrum to reflect the changes in Dencun. These changes are already in effect on Arbitrum Nova.
ARDC Risk Member Election
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders who they support for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to fill the Risk seat.
Recommendation: Vote Chaos Labs. Chaos Labs is the only candidate.
ARDC Security Member Election
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders who they support for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to fill the Security seat.
Recommendation: Vote Trail of Bits. Trail of Bits is synonymous with top-of-the-line security research. We have no doubt they will do a wonderful job in this role.
ARDC DAO Advocate Election
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders who they support for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to fill the DAO Advocate seat.
Recommendation: Vote L2Beat/Ant Federation. L2Beat is a large delegate and consistently a voice that advocates for Arbitrum governance and ARB holders. This formalizes that role within the ARDC.
ARDC Research Member Election
Summary: This poll asks ARB holders who they support for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to fill the Research seat.
Recommendation: Vote 50% Blockworks/Delphi Digital, 50% The Block. Either of these providers would be able to fill this role well.",37
22213,lino,2024-03-06 17:05:06,"As a recent grantee from an Arbitrum DAO program, the last couple of weeks on ETH Dever were fantastic. I had dozens of wonderful meetings and specifically enjoyed the opportunity to contribute to the DAO during GovHack!
One key area that I got involved in is Arbitrum Ventures, a nascent initiative that revolves around four interconnected questions:

how do we attract and support builders?
how do we bring the best returns to Arbitrum?
how do we diversify revenue streams?
and how do we ensure sustainability and defensibility?

The typical approach is deploying grants to incentivize ecosystem development. Although very powerful, grants also have some limitations that manifest in tensions, such as:

Concerns about retention of grantees in the ecosystem
Concerns about the ROI of incentive programs
Concerns with the incentive alignment of service providers
Challenges with forecasting the sequencer fees that different programs could generate
Growing reporting structures and additional resources consumed in oversight

Multiple conversations were underway exploring complementary options to grants. What if we invested in projects and programs and could benefit from their growth directly (on top of sequencer fees)?
From that point of view, one might ask why don’t we put the treasury in A16Z or whatever your flavor of best-performing fund in Web3? Does that, however, align with developing Arbitrum? Likely, the token holders betted on scaling Ethereum and creating a vibrant Arbitrum ecosystem, not just on increasing the treasury of an investment DAO.
Could a middle way between pure ROI or pure developmental objectives provide the ideal answer?
This is the same question that a lot of corporate venture arms and government-backed VC instruments have been faced with for decades, leading to different answers based on their unique circumstances…
For example, when I worked with supporting venture scientists in the UK and we deployed over £25m, the answer proved to be:

Developing a community of the funding recipients and measuring entrepreneurial mindset in all the individuals over extended periods of time regardless if they continued to run a venture, engaged in licensing deals or became supporting talent.
Measuring how networks evolved
Measuring the propagation of relevant knowledge related to our thesis

This model prioritized development objectives over ROI, being close to some DAO grant programs.
In contrast, when I was negotiating a mandate to deploy EUR 35m, coming mostly from the European Investment Fund, the solution was

A straightforward VC with €30m, where 70% were anchored and 30% had to come from the market
Commitment for 50% in fund 2 and 30% in fund 3.
An additional 5 mil accelerator fund where the LP agreement was more akin to a grant. The fund manager was allowed to take an equity stake on the back of them, as long as very specific developmental criteria were met and a strict schedule for their deployment was followed. Where the upside of every successful exit was split 50:50 between the funder and manager, regardless if the overall instrument made a net loss.
What was being measured was how much pipeline value was created from the accelerator, where the same manager can capture a lot of it from the fund mixed with private market capital, and how much co-investment from top-tier other funds was attracted to this pipeline.

This second model provided for both ROI and developmental objectives, by adjusting parameters around the “hurdle rate” and other important details.
Both models are flavors of developmental venture capital (dVC, for short). And many more models in this spectrum have been tried and could be explored.
During GovHack, we started to explore with delegates, representatives from the Foundation, and other experts in the community, and the conversation was beyond inspiring and encouraging.


So the question is:
Should the Arbitrum DAO explore dVC? And if so, On the spectrum between:

Arbitrum development focus: “We get that we need to go beyond grants, but we don’t care about equity value as long as more and more builders come to build on Arbitrum, scale up, and are happy.“

And

ROI focus: “As long as we are invested in the best builders in the market and they are growing, we do not care if they build on Arbitrum in the long run“

Where do we want to land?


And, crucially, how much capacity to design a dVC model is currently available in the Arbitrum DAO, given other needs.
As such, this post is an invitation to engage with this discussion and find out who’s interested in contributing so we can start maturing the idea!
What are your thoughts? Is this something exciting? Do you have expertise in this area and are available to contribute? Where in the spectrum should we go?",1
22213,cp0x,2024-03-06 21:27:00,"Hello, @lino
I don’t have much experience in Ventures, but I think, that main purpose of Arbitrum community to development and quality improvement to increase competitiveness of Arbitrum chain. And for this, the DAO has enough funds.
However, this does not mean that the DAO should throw money left and right, but you need to understand how grants increase the above parameters.
It seems to me that we need to look for a balance in these two approaches that you proposed.",2
22213,lino,2024-03-11 05:31:00,"@cp0x, indeed! For the avoidance of doubt I wouldn’t describe grants as throwing away money. They can and do have their ROI.
On the flip side there’s something to be said about keeping the treasury sustainable. Perhaps there’s nothing wrong to put some of it in assets that are not Arbitrum aligned or even crypto aligned for that matter.
Something that would be incredibly useful would be if we can come up some rules of thumb or approaches that can guide us.
E.g. if we’re investing money with primarily chain development objectives, we should aim to achieve at least 7% return pa and beyond that optimise for strategic value.",3

FAQ and Best Practices Guide for the Delegate Incentive Program

How should delegates calculate the Participation rate (PR)?
The participation rate for delegates will be determined through the dashboard provided by Karma, specifically designed to measure each interested delegate’s participation in Tally. To prevent manipulation of the system, the PR will be calculated based on the DAO’s voting history  (excluding tests and [OLD] tags).
Only votes that conclude by the last day of the current month will be considered for the PR calculation. This means a proposal that starts in January and ends in February will not be counted towards January’s PR calculation, even if voted on in January.

Note: In future iterations of the program (as decided by the DAO), this criterion could be adjusted to an average of the last 90 or 120 days of voting activity. This adjustment aims to lower the entry barriers to the program.

Yes, delegates can enroll in the program at any time, provided they meet the requirements specified in this document . To apply, please refer to the enrollment thread available here .
When does a delegate’s participation become effective if they subscribe at any time?
To minimize the potential for program manipulation, delegates who register before the third day of the month will be included for the incentive calculations of the current month. This three-day margin, approximately 10% of the month, is set as the maximum grace period for those delegates who wish to join the incentive program at the time of their registration.

21319,danielo,2024-02-18 15:41:26,"You might’ve heard the saying, “great minds think alike!” That couldn’t be further from the truth.
Many of the most productive partnerships throughout history worked precisely because two great minds thought differently in complementary ways. Case in point: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Jobs was more sales-minded and more of a “big picture” guy, while Wozniak was the more technical electronics guru. Clearly, their partnership worked out well for Apple — despite (or likely because) the two Steves frequently butted heads.
Great minds don’t think alike. They think together.
This principle poses a serious challenge to DAO governance as we know it. We must enable the broader community to advocate for their interest, lest they’re exploited, and the organization is led to failure through pillaging. BUT, a large group with low context can be easily captured by narcissistic populists, as the history of humanity shows.
On the other hand, extensive research has shown that groups of non-experts can outperform individual experts in certain situations. “The Wisdom of the Crowds” is an excellent mechanism to make simple judgments on a variable; for example, it’s been shown that a crowd can judge, visually, the weight of a cow (using the median, not the average value) better than individual experts can. So we could apply this “vote a number” technique to for example determine the amount of compensation for a specific role or the value of a variable in a prediction market.
When crowds voting make bad decisions is in complex situations. If there are complex trade-offs and individuals have incomplete information (e.g. most strategy decisions for organisations), then a crowd simply voting will likely result in the minimum common denominator being selected. This is a recipe for mediocrity.
For this reason, democracy researchers have been looking for a method to

bridge the information gap between participants (so it’s not just their initial judgments but their best judgments after having a more comprehensive set of insights and unpacked tradeoffs)
While preserving democratic-legitimacy

Elections with vigorous debates being broadcasted somewhat fulfill this pattern somewhat. However, elections are very prone to capture by capital (only those who afford massive advertising stand a fair chance); perhaps more critically, this method of decision-making requires massive bandwidth (just look how much attention presidential elections consume). The consequence is a low throughput of decisions, i.e., the crowd can only participate in a few decisions, thus limiting actual democracy.
Another answer that’s gained momentum over the last 2 decades is Citizen Assemblies - the selection of a diverse group of participants through the lottery, who will receive input from experts and key stakeholders and have extensive space to deliberate on the answer to a challenge and make a proposal (optionally ratified by vote).
Citizen Assemblies work by

addressing the information gap through deliberation (facilitated workshops) and plennaries (public input from experts and stakeholders).
Reducing the risk of bribes or agenda capture thanks to selecting citizens by lottery as opposed to by popular election.
Using a representative sample to balance legitimacy with throughput (i.e. multiple assemblies can be run in parallel or over a short period of time on varying topics).
Paying participants a nominal amount so economically disprivileged groups can afford to participate.

And as a bonus, Citizen Assemblies tend to be bridging instead of polarising, that is, the format enables participants to find common solutions as opposed to making extreme takes to gain clicks or denigrating their opponent.
As a downside, Citizen Assemblies do cost more than appointing a single or small group of experts to decide, and take time (about 2-4 months) to run as a full process. In consequence, not every decision should be run by an assembly but only those that are a) complex b) important enough to justify the time and cost.
We (currently an informal and amorphous group including a dozen delegates, serious people, RnDAO members, etc) have been discussing the need and approach to define a Strategy for the ArbitrumDAO. We’d love you to join us discussing this topic and finding a way forward

The few are educated on governance, philosophy and the relevance subjects then they are the once that do research on the agendas of the people seeking to be voted into office and make the appropriate decisions.
After thinking about if for a while I thought of a hybrid; the few individuals have more weight than the common citizens. Then again it occurred to me that such a system is also prone to bribery due to a small subset of the population being the single point of failure to a degree.
Societies and their systems are just fascinating… Somehow an equilibrium sets in pegged to the morality and the tolerance of its core.",2
21319,ChrisB,2024-03-07 13:29:54,"A DAO’s weakest link is its own governance. Citizen’s Assemblies are one of a number of ways that Sortition can solve this.
Sortition is the use of random selection to create manageable, representative panels of community members who are then empowered to make decisions on behalf of the whole group or organization. It is slowly beginning to gain some traction as an alternative to local and national electoral systems. I believe that in an era of polarizing algorithms and AI, it could offer the same benefits and be even more relevant to DAO governance. In essence, I believe that:

DAOs are vulnerable to attack via their community and governance structure
Voting is a key weakness due to its inherent corruptibility
DAOs need to harness the power of random representation to address the risks of vote-based electioneering

Proposal: AIP 1.05: Return 700M $ARB to the DAO Treasury

Vote: Against
Rationale: This is a duplicate proposal and we are aware that sending 750M ARB could have been communicated more effectively and open, It is reasonable to give the Arbitrum Foundation the budget necessary for the next few years, especially with the implementation of AIP 1.1 providing more structure.

Rationale: We were not in support of this proposal. We would have preferred to see how the projects that already received STIP funds perform before sending out more funds
Proposal: Funding Gas Rebate and Trading Competition Program to Amplify Arbitrum’s Ecosystem Growth
Voted: Against
Rationale: We believe the timing of this proposal was all wrong. It should have been included when the STIP was live rather than coming as a stand-alone proposal
Proposal: AIP: ArbOS Version 11
Voted: For
Rationale: We were in support of the changes and upgrades to the Arbitrum chain seeing they have been audited
Proposal: Timeline Extension for STIP and Backfund Grantees
Voted: Voted Extend for both
Rationale: After reviewing the proposal, and sighting the extreme variations in KYC timing and inappropriate timing for the backfund STIPs, it only made sense to extend the deadline
Proposal: Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates
Voted: For
Rationale: We voted in favor of incentivizing delegates for their participation in the ArbitrumDAO. We have been in a few communities that implemented this and have seen how such programs foster more active participation, bringing in newer contributors in the process
Proposal: Establish the ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’
Voted: Abstain then Lowest to Highest
Rationale: We abstained and then voted from lowest to highest. If the ARDC should be implemented, we should start with the lowest possible cost iteration, and see how that turns out before pushing to scale
[Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee
Voted: For
Rationale: Establishing the Procurement Committee adds a needed layer of structure to the ArbitrumDAO. DAOStewards vote in favor of this proposal.
Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal
Voted: For
Rationale: Sighting the potential risk of removing the lower threshold, DAOStewards votes to increase the multi-sig threshold to 9/12 as this is a more straightforward approach to tackling the Stage requirement
[Constitutional] Changes to the Constitution and the Security Council Election Process
Voted: For
Rationale: Providing better wording is essential to ensure clarity in the Constitution and the community at large. DAOStewards voted in favor of these changes.
AIP: Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix
Voted: For
Rationale: These proposed changes are highly welcome as it doesn’t affect the original model but add a layer of security. DAOStewards votes in favor of this proposal.
Empowering Early Contributors: The Community Arbiter Proposal 2.0
Voted: Abstain
Rationale: When this proposal dropped last time out, some clarifications were requested by the DAO. These weren’t still tended to so DAOStewards voted to abstain.
Funding for Into the Dungeons: Machinata - a PvP Digital Miniature Game
Voted: Against

 Some Governance Discussions:
[Proposal] Fix Fee Oversight ArbOS v20 “Atlas”
Description:
This proposal addresses an oversight in the ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade related to transaction fees on the Arbitrum network. It suggests reducing the L1 surplus fee per byte from 32 gwei to 0 and the L2 base fee from 0.1 gwei to 0.01 gwei to better align with the upcoming Dencun upgrade on Ethereum and the configurations implemented in Arbitrum Nova.
The changes aim to lower fees for users and potentially increase transaction throughput, although they would reduce the short-term revenue for the ArbitrumDAO. The proposal seeks a temperature check and ultimately a vote from the ArbitrumDAO, with the Security Council executing the changes if approved.
Status:
A temp check voting is about to happen and available in snapshot.

Voting Reminders
Active Proposals Live for Voting
The following proposals are available for voting, and we encourage all delegates to analyze and exercise their right to vote.

Proposal to fund Plurality Labs Milestone 1B(ridge) (temp check)This proposal aims to advance the development of a diverse grants framework for the Arbitrum DAO. The total cost and timeframe are: 3.36M ARB over 6 months, with 336k ARB allocated to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management.Deadline: Thursday, March 7, 2024.

Risk MemberDeadline: Tuesday, March 12, 2024.


[Non-Emergency Action] Fix Fee Oversight ArbOS v20 “Atlas” (temp check)The ArbOS 20 proposal neglected changes to 2 parameters, which would lead to significantly higher fees post-implementation than if these changes are made. This proposal seeks the DAO’s approval for the security council to make the necessary adjustments to these 2 parameters to optimize fees.Deadline: Tuesday, March 12, 2024.

22155,SEEDGov,2024-03-05 03:48:35,"Hello everyone! After so many preparations, the incentive program for delegates is finally running.
During February we created a post named “Incentive Program Delegate Application” where all delegates submitted their applications to the program.
We collected all data for these delegates and made a list that can be found here.
1350×651 75.4 KB
As you can see on the table, those delegates who have the “Check” are the ones who met the initial requirements to be part of the program. The total number of delegates that will participate in this first month of the program is 36. You can find all information about the participants on this Karma Dashboard.
Historic Participation Rate on tally explained
We would like to comment that the Historic Tally participation (PR) is calculated considering all votings that Arbitrum has done on Tally, excluding the [OLD] and test proposals.
The PR is calculated automatically by this Karma Dashboard, where in order to accomplish the PR requirement of the program the users must have a PR greater than 25%.
1566×1600 164 KB
This must not be confused with the “on-chain votes” that is shown on the profile of each delegate, this a percentage of the participation rate on tally of each delegate since the of the account on tally

If you are a delegate and you want to know what is your historic participation rate on tally, just check and find your delegate address on this Karma Dashboard.
Note: This dashboard only shows those delegates with a voting power greater than 50k ARB.
Application Rules
Even though the program has started, we would like to remind you of the rules of the program:

A delegate can submit an application to participate in the program anytime.
If a delegate submits the application before the first 3 days of the month, the delegate’s score will begin to count from the same month.
If a delegate submits the application after the first 3 days of the month, the delegate’s score will begin to count from the next month.

Snapshot and Tally profiles are straightforward to provide. However, the ARC is comprised of 8 members who provide feedback on the Arbitrum forum under their personal accounts. Should all of these individual’s forum username and twitter profile be provided, or just the @TreasureDAO for handle and Treasure Governance twitter account.
In connection with the previous point, since most of the ARC’s actions are carried out through the personal forum accounts of ARC members, can we assume that their actions will contribute to Treasure’s Delegate Incentive Program score, rather than solely activity originating from Treasure’s DAOs organization account?",6

Want to point out to @SEEDGov that the Tally metrics for everyone may need to be manually adjusted since there are versions marked [OLD] for 2 votes that were re-started, and the initial test proposal that is also captured in the statistics for every delegate.


Yes, we have contemplated and clarified it here. I think Karma does the calculation automatically, I will check.

2. Historical Tally Participation Greater than 25%: This value is taken directly from the tally, specifically from the profile of each delegate, only those with a participation greater than 25% will be considered as eligible.

 Bob-Rossi:

Is there expectations for delegates who act as one person to create delegate threads? Would it make it easier?


Hi, it is not obligatory, but we recommend it as a good practice, as it makes it easier to follow the decisions of each delegate. The most important thing we believe is the feedback on the proposals and also the rational of each delegate (it does not necessarily have to be a thread).

It is valid to point out that we need to find a balance in this aspect. We understand that technical proposals may be more complex to comment on, and we do not want the process to become mere formalism or spam. However, we believe that it may be worthwhile to comment on certain technical proposals, which are simpler to understand.
In addition, we believe that if a delegate maintains his or her vote consisting of snapshots and tally, it is not necessary to justify every vote, unless he or she wishes to clarify something. However, should you change your vote, we expect you to provide justification.
We will reflect on the concerns you have raised and work on developing more specific guidelines.",11

I think that is fair. Where multisig signers and conceptual things like that are easier to understand and delegates should have input on them.

Incentive Program Delegate Application

Ok, thnx for reply
Another question: do I have to have >50k during the entire program? Or just at the start of the program?


@ruslanklinkov sorry for the delay in responding. I think this answers your question



FAQ and Best Practices Guide for the Delegate Incentive Program

How long must the delegate have >50k ARB voting power?
Upon enrollment in the program, and throughout each month, delegates must ensure that they maintain, for at least 85% of the monthly duration, a VP equal or greater than 50k ARB. This translates to maintaining the required VP for a minimum of 25 days per month. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the delegate not being considered for the program for the current month and subsequent months until they manage to restore their VP to the required level and maintain it above 85% of the time.


We have created a guide that I believe answers several questions:

FAQ and Best Practices Guide for the Delegate Incentive Program

When does a delegate’s participation become effective if they subscribe at any time?
To minimize the potential for program manipulation, delegates who register before the third day of the month will be included for the incentive calculations of the current month. This three-day margin, approximately 10% of the month, is set as the maximum grace period for those delegates who wish to join the incentive program at the time of their registration. Those who register after the third day will be considered for the program starting the following month.

Test
It is important to note that for this new test, we took into consideration only those delegates that applied on the application thread of the program until the end of February. The other delegates that didn’t apply to the program or apply after February were not taken into the calculations.
With these criteria, we proceeded to manually load the data of all the delegates in a table. The following raw data were obtained.
Test month
For the elaboration of this test, we have taken February 2024 as a sample. Where we collected information from the delegates for February about their:

Snapshot votings (SV)
Tally votings (TV)
Communication Rationales (CR)
Comments in proposals (CP)
History Tally Participation rate (PR)

Proposals considered
Just like the test #2 (January), we took in consideration those proposals that ended on the month of study, in this case, February
Snapshot:


AIP: Changes to the Constitution and the Security Council Election Process
(Ended February 5)


Final: Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program
(Ended February 7)


AIP: ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas”
(Ended February 9)


AIP: Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix
(Ended February 12)


[Non-Constitutional]: Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0

Proposal: [Non-Constitutional] Funding for Into the Dungeons: Machinata - a PvP Digital Miniature Game V2

Tally:


Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee

Long Term Incentives Pilot Program

Changes to the Constitution and the Security Council Election Process

Table: FEB24 (60% TP)
According to the criteria expressed above (TP 60%), in conjunction with the results of the calculations in the table, the delegates that would receive compensation would be as follows:
1246×397 43.8 KB
To see the complete table click here.
Test Results
As in the previous test, despite the fact that the program is designed to give incentives to the TOP 50 thin people who meet all the criteria, for the month of February 2024 only 15 Delegates met enough attributes to obtain compensation. These can be viewed below:

We would like to emphasize that the requirements are not exhaustive. Even if you are a delegate with a low Participation Rate (PR%) but with active participation during the month you can exceed 60% of the required TP.
In case there is any error in the data upload or any other concerns, we encourage the community to provide feedback to make this process as accurate as possible.
Considerations

As a source of truth we used Tally votes, Snapshots and delegate comments posted on the Forum.
While we understand that delegates use other platforms to discuss, for the moment we will only use these platforms as a source of truth, in the future if the DAO wishes, new sources can be added.
For this test, only comments during the month of February were considered.
As in the previous test and as mentioned in the proposal @cattin should not be included in the accounting.

Conclusions
In this third and final test we were able to try out new ideas to optimize the framework before its official first month of the program (March). These new ideas helped us to see more of the true potential of the program. However, for this program to have the desired effect, the active participation of the forum delegates is necessary.
In this test the table was filled in manually, so there may be a human error factor. To address this we are actively working with Karma to automate the counting of certain parameters.
As in the previous test there was a low number of delegates who met all the requirements to be compensated.
Once the program starts, we are confident that there will be a greater dynamism in the DAO and a better organization when it comes to voting, commenting and communicating voting intentions.
We invite all delegates to apply for the program and fill in the template with all the information requested in this thread.
In case you have any questions, need help or think you can give feedback on how to improve the program, you can do so by posting in this thread.
We encourage delegates to participate and give their best effort to improve participation in the forum and the arbitrum ecosystem in general.",1

Context
Arbitrum has significant resources; however, the space counts with many strong players (alt-L1s and L2s, Solana, etc). Without both short-term wins AND ambitious medium to long-term bets, Arbitrum risks becoming irrelevant. More urgently, workgroups, proposers, and delegates need shared context to work together (e.g., at a recent KPI working group call, participants tried to create a rubric for the incentive program. However, we realized that without objectives and a north star, it was difficult to create it).
This document proposes a “strategy ontology” - a framework serving as an agreed format to define the strategy for the Arbitrum DAO.
“All frameworks are wrong but some are useful”. Our hope is that having the ontology agreed upon will streamline a subsequent discussion on the content of the strategy.
The Ask:
Please review the framework below and let us know if

Is it clear and understandable?
Would you support Arbitrum DAO using it or what would you change?

TLDR:
This framework, called SKIs Framework, showcases a comprehensive mapping of essential functions of a system (as applied to ArbitrumDAO) for viability. All functions identified in the framework are essential; however, they’re not equally urgent. The areas marked in green are recommended as priorities to agree on and fund.

Implementation
Using the framework would mean using this ontology to run a collective process:

Map inputs into the strategy (Market Sensing)
Define a 2-3 Year Goal & accompanying metrics (Goal’s KPIs & Health Metrics)
Define a set of Strategic Pillars
Allocate funding for the Pillars

Theory: How to do Strategy in DAOs
Top-down strategy, although refined as a discipline, has been extensively criticized as executives removed from the front lines fail to appreciate opportunities and challenges.
Equally, DAOs, where a broad community decides on local matters, risk failing to appreciate local complexities and miss opportunities. On the opposite end, if all decisions are made locally without common agreements, synergies and strategies suffer. After all, strategic thinking is as much choosing what to do as about choosing what not to do.
Strategy as a lighthouse
Strategy is only effective when implemented, and this requires combining large decisions (large-scale funding allocation) and small ones (onboarding documentation, content curation in meetups, etc.). Naturally, no single actor can effectively control all such decisions (not even in centralized organizations), which requires strategic considerations (trade-offs and priorities) to be widely understood. And for creating such understanding, reading a document is not enough, as words are quickly forgotten. It’s only when actors engage in critical reflection on the strategic trade-offs and priorities and when they reflect on how those impact their own situations and choices that a strategic process becomes meaningful and memorable.
The tools and processes to facilitate this collective participation and reflection, although having significantly advanced over the last decade, are still a work in progress. As such, certain trade-offs are needed (as well as investment in advancing tooling and processes for collective deliberation).
An approach to mitigate the tension outlined above is a metaphor we call “strategy as a lighthouse”: we don’t tell people what to do, but we show where the shore and the rocks are.
In this model, strategic planning can be done by a workgroup that proposes recommendations. This model is akin to a think tank for nation-state strategy. Wherever possible, the lighthouse model should be enhanced with tools and processes for larger groups to provide input and feedback.
In this document, we are aiming to strike a balance between this consideration and the time constraints to advance a strategy. As such, the proposed approach starts with an imperfect but faster version and then aims to evolve over time towards increasingly robust and collective processes.
Horizons
For our strategy, we distinguish between four horizons of activity, all equally important:

Operations and Improvement: doing and refining what we’re already doing.
Innovation: creating new products or capabilities.
Transformation: disrupting ourselves and transforming the fundamentals of our business model.
Foundational Research: exploring new horizons and possibilities.

The horizons progress from more measurable and predictable to harder to measure and unpredictable. Equally, the risk-reward ration varies across horizons, from lower risk but lower potential reward to high risk and higher potential reward.
System Viability
Ultimately, any strategy framework seeks to address the viability of the system. As such, the strategy framework is anchored within a larger framework of organizational viability. Borrowing from Cybernetics, we thus embed our strategy framework as one component of 6 essential functions for system viability (i.e. Six Key Interactions):

Identity: Who are we, and what needs do we exist to serve? Outputs alignment and belonging.
Future: How will we evolve to meet those needs, given how our environment is evolving? Outputs foresight.
Change: How do we transform to move from here to that future? Outputs strategy and strategic initiatives.
Coordination: How do we coordinate and harmonise our work? Outputs mechanisms to reduce conflicts and use resources effectively.
Operations: What are we doing every day to deliver our value to our stakeholders? Outputs maintenance and operation of the Infrastructure.
Support: How do we make it possible for every participant to give their best sustainably and evolve our mindsets? Outputs top performing teams.

All these six layers are interdependent and equally essential for viability over the medium to long term; however, they’re not equally urgent to implement.
Proposed Framework Details
The framework is divided into a series of artifacts. Each artifact fulfills a specific function, enabling us to break down the discussion into manageable chunks.
Identity Layer Artefacts
Guiding Question
Definition: What’s the big question (i.e. challenge) that we seek to answer as an organization?
Time horizon: decade(s)
Example: How can we fuel financial sovereignty? + list of stakeholders and their needs
Values
Definition: When we pick between multiple options, which principles shall inform our choice?
Time horizon: 3-10 years
Example: Ethereum-aligned, Sustainable, Secure, Socially inclusive, Technically inclusive, User Focused, Neutral and Open.
Mission
Definition: What role will we take in answering said question?
Time horizon: 5-10 years
Example: Spearhead the evolution of decentralized technologies and governance.
MetaGovernance
Definition: Process to change the governance system of the DAO
Time horizon: 1-5 years
Example: Proposal process to change DAO governance smart contracts, constitution, etc.
Future Layer Artefacts
Market Sensing
Definition: sensing and mapping of

market forces ( growing or shrinking segments; stakeholder switching costs; changing jobs, pains, and gains; etc).
Key Trends (technology innovations; regulatory constraints; sociocultural trends; etc).
Industry forces (competitors; rising value chain actors; new or fading technology providers; etc).
MacroEconomic forces (global market conditions; access to resources; high or low commodities prices; etc).

Time Horizon: primarily 1-5 years (short-term single definitions and medium and long-term scenario mapping)
Examples: competitive landscape, trend reports, etc.
Business Model(s)
Definition: How do we create, deliver, and capture value?
Time horizon: 2- 3 years
Example: https://images.app.goo.gl/Dqwh7cHx1MtYDSRp6
R&D Bets
Key areas of high uncertainty for foundational research and transformation (because sometimes the best way to predict the future is to invent it).
Time horizon: 2 - 8 years (Transformation & Foundational Research)
Examples: fundamental research in cryptography, quantum computing, etc.
Change Layer Artefacts
2-3 year Goal
Definition: What do we aim to have accomplished in 2-3 years from now?
Time horizon: 2- 3 years
Example: Becoming the defacto place (infrastructure + community) for people to build on and interact with Web3.
Strategic Pillars
Definition: short and medium-term big bets for the success of the network.
Time Horizon: 1-3 years (Improvement & Innovation time horizon).
Examples: Robust Tech stack, World Class DevReel, Leading on Key Verticals (Gaming, Collab Tech, DeFi), Operational Excellence, etc.
Audit (connected to Change Layer but ideally separate group)
2-3 Year Goals & Ecosystem Health KPIs
Definition: Which indicators will we use to measure progress toward our Mission/Vision and 2-3 year Goal, and which to measure network health?
Time horizon: 2- 3 years
Examples: Sequencer Fees, TVL, Dev Activity, Community Health (sense of community, engagement, social network analysis), GDP, etc.
Operations Layer Artefacts
This layer should include the different operational Units, recurring activities (ops activities like reviewing and voting on proposals, reviewing grants performance, etc), and assets that are governed.
Coordination Layer Artefacts
Communication, Knowledge Management, & Scheduling systems
Definition: systems and tools to enable effective interaction between participants in the network.
Time horizon: 6 - 24 months.
Examples: Forums, AI Q&A bots, scheduling and video call tools, etc.
Conflict Resolution system
Definition: systems and tools for conflict resolution between participants in the network.
Time horizon: 6 - 24 months.
Examples: Agreed conflict resolution processes (mediation, arbitration), conflict detection bots, etc.
Support Layer Artefacts
Wellbeing & Performance systems
Definition: systems, tools, and platforms to enable personal and professional development, well-being and inclusivity, and peak performance of network participants.
Time horizon: 6 - 24 months.
Examples: Personal development programs, education programs, suicide hotline, etc.
Implementing the Framework
The suggestion is to launch a minimum viable process to:

Launch a Future Workgroup (analysts, visionaries, and researchers) to facilitate the mapping of inputs into the strategy (Market Sensing, non-binding).
Launch a Strategy Workgroup to facilitate a set of workshops to define a 2-3 Year Goal, accompanying metrics (Goal’s KPIs & Health Metrics), and a set of Strategic Pillars.
Ratify via vote.
Allocate funding pools to advance the strategy.

The Pillars and funding can then be reviewed periodically based on progress across all layers.
Each funding pool can then be allocated across programs that will use said funding. Importantly, programs don’t need to match the Strategic Pillars 1-1; each program should be assessed based on its holistic merit across Pillars (more on the proposed assessment mechanic here).
As a final consideration, an additional pool(s) of funding should be left open for community proposals outside of the 2-3 Year Goal and Strategic Pillars to enable bottom-up strategy.
The suggested balance is 50% allocated to strategic pillars and 50% for bottom-up strategy, this balance is meant to recognize the ability of DAO participants to sense and adapt, navigating a complex environment. In this sense, the allocation to both the Goal’s Strategic Pillars (top-down) and outside the Pillars (bottom-up) represents a trade-off in favor of medium and long-term resilience even over short-term efficiency (in alignment with the Value of Sustainability).
Next Steps
After reviewing the framework, please let us know whether you’d support using it in Arbitrum.
Suggestions, edits, comments, additional references, clarifying questions, etc. are also most welcomed.
If this initiative gathers support, we’ll aim to form a group to advance it by shaping implementation proposal(s) and engaging with the delegates and community to construct it.

Here is the article that taught me the differences.
Here is an exert:
“The Japanese system is inclusionary, as contrasted to the exclusionary system common here in the US. The typical zoning form in America is called euclidian zoning, which specifies the allowed uses and dimensions for a zone. Japan zones limit the “maximum nuisance” in a zone, and allow for any development below that threshold (e.g. a factory can’t be built in a residential neighborhood but housing can be built in a light industrial zone). You can think of this as whitelist vs blacklist approaches. The result in the Japanese case is a lot more mixed use development, while in the US land use is a lot more segregated.”",2

next steps
As mentioned during the call, for now, we’re exploring whether this initiative (defining a strategic framework and using the framework to define strategic priorities) should go ahead. We’re sensing the answer is yes so far but it’s still early and we want to hear from more delegates and other stakeholders.
We’ll be discussing next steps in the telegram group and once we get a clear next step, we’ll share here.
Some initial ideas (feedback on these and other ideas welcomed):

creating a repo for resources on how to do strategy
reaching out to other stakeholders to let them know this is brewing
planning a next workshop

20947,RMan,2024-02-01 21:58:02,"A completely new Arbitrum (ARB) holder and blockchain user here.   Affiliated with reddit community 2-3M subscribers/5K active users /r/ethtrader, but a former Maker Delegate, etc.   Prime reason I am here was to try to find a 20-50K grant to support the community $DONUT infrastructure move from Gnosis Chain to Arbitrum.
So I have been wading through all kinds of grant stuff just to figure out where to post a simple community grant for above community.   In the Telegram group I saw the above posted and decided to read this post which inspired me to make an account and sign in.
What I have to say here is based on now years of experience with MakerDAO and many other DAOs as well as my own 40+ years as a former consultant team lead, and operations specialist passing through hundreds of companies.   I can’t say I have done everything, but sometimes it feels that way.
Rather than comment on the above in specific ways I am going to make a couple general statements regarding business 'process
First…
Almost all business processes have to be cyclic.   Which means whatever is decided now on ANY of the subjects in the post, there needs to be a process related to reviewing the associated KPI metrics, AND a method to incorporate feed back mechanisms allowing long term strategy, frameworks, pillars, even the KPIs themselves to be looked at and changed according to feedback from those subjected to them (managers, directors, delegates, developers, users, etc.)
Key point is, to be adaptable a system must constantly put forward a ‘vision’ for itself, define metrics for success (KPIs), operate the system, collect data, review, then adjust.    This cyclic process needs to have reasonably practical and achievable cycle times.  Far too often I see companies, DAOs get mired down and self destruct simply because they could not adapt quickly enough to changing environments or adapting too slowly or not at all.  I also see very lofty frameworks that take huge amounts of time being put forward, which ultimately don’t meet the immediate community needs.
Great to have a 3-10 year focus but if you don’t spend time getting through the next 3 weeks to 3 months - irrelevant.
KISS, and focus on low hanging fruit to get you to next steps can help focus personal and community priorities.   Not clear to me what Arbitrum envisions, also not clear to me what community envisions in this respect.
There is a fine line between being reasonably adaptable using above, and overthinking or over cycling. In the above Strategy document I see nothing regarding how this process ‘cycles’ allowing for introspection, and change leading to project/people/structure adaptability and how even the cycle time itself on some things might need to be very fast now, but slow later…

The second point.
While we all want to have our fingers in the governance process.  I have seen the results far too often of what happens when too many cooks are in the kitchen, or when too many strong views are in the house.  I want to urge some caution regarding community inclusion.   Here again it may be necessary to have a lot of cooks initially, but maybe less better cooks are required to satisfy getting a community meal in a reasonable time.
We can all talk about visions for the future, but in the end we are focusing on what we need to do today, or tomorrow because maybe next month, or year, is so far out we can’t even begin to take a stab at what we should be building or talking about for next year.  Unlike money that can just slather around to get something done, people time is limited and so we really need to look at what time horizons people/communities are looking at around here and maybe put some more care into what we can accomplish this week, or this month, than what we might envision 3-10 years from now.
I could go on, but the above I think captures two key things I have seen DAOs, companies futz or fluff on.

I will say that my first immersion in Arbitrum Telegram just trying to find what I feel is a smallish grant for /r/ethtrader far more daunting that I would have expected.  It is great to see a lively and dynamic community, and I have had great help from some individuals to steer me, but just trying to connect as an appointed representative of the community I represent to the Arbitrum community in a personal way leading to a positive tangible result for the community I represent, time consuming and very difficult so far practically.   Everyone very kind, respectful, and pretty focused but just no-one to act formally as Arbitrum liason to me Rman (Eth-Man/MakerMan) to Arbitrum community.
I am going to make one suggestion given so much going on.  Please consider putting together a D2A (DAO to Arbitrum) group of professionals.  The specific goal is basically to have DAOs looking to do things on Arbitrum, have a single or dual point contact for information, and assistance to achieving their tangible goals.   I mean I would be fine if I presented my community case to someone knowledgeable and they said “nah we don’t have any grants for you”.  This would have saved me many hours of time.  Or better someone who could say “your community is exactly what we are looking for,  this is our vision of how you can help us, and if that fits your community vision, here is what we have to help you”.    I am suggesting dedicating resources to building a B2B or D2A business team with key goal to act as point people to bring DAOs, projects, businesses to Arbitrum.   Here you can filter projects by size (people, $$ TVL, token market cap, developers, tech, what they want, etc.).  This centralizes Arbitrum in a way that may help everyone looking to do things, vs. hunting around for grants or other information, and also provide a well balanced place for Arbitrum to share a vision of how it sees itself, but also learn about how other projects, communities see themselves within Arbitrum blockchain and community that is personal, building real community relationships.
/r/ethtrader is coming to Arbitrum, grants or no grants.  Individually both our communities will just work towards our own singular visions.   But if Arbitrum can work intimately with other communities this becomes more of what are ‘we’ doing together vs. what ‘everyone else is doing themselves’.
Too many times I see more ‘I’ than ‘we’ in DAO and even if no project in crypto gets there.   I keep working on a completely alternative vision that may ‘give us a chance’.
I will give one example.   How exactly does Arbitrum see itself in the whole ecosystem.   One ring to rule them all (which I have seen people comment that they want Arbitrum to dominate the crypto environment - aka win), or one blockchain supporting the entire ecosystem?   This also extends to how crypto sees itself with respect to Traditional Finance (which in most cases I read people believe crypto will replace or supplant Traditional Finance).    I think we need to get away from competing to win, to how we can cooperate so we all win.",4
20947,danielo,2024-02-03 18:02:15,"Notes on Arbitrum Strategy Discussion 1 (non official) - Thursday 1st Feb 2024
Full recording: AplOttr's Meeting Notes
Summary
The discussion centered on a strategic initiative aimed at defining strategic priorities, and thus informing the creation of KPIs. This initiative seeks to build a solid strategic foundation, facilitate the grant selection process, and enhance collaboration across projects. The initiative is in its early stages, focusing on gathering feedback on whether it should go ahead and input on the approach to do strategy in a DAO.
Strategic Initiative Overview

Origin and Evolution: The initiative began with Alex and Dan and has gradually attracted more participants. Currently, Daniel Ospina (RnDAO) is leading facilitation (informal appointment).
Current Stage: Very early stages, with efforts concentrated on assessing the viability of a strategy-making process in the Arbitrum DAO and discussing the approach we can take.

Goals and Objective of the initiative

Building Foundations: Establishing a solid strategic foundation is key to defining concrete goals and incentives and can also reduce delegate fatigue by providing criteria that can be referenced, thus streamlining discussions.
Complete Work in Progress: There’s an acknowledgment of existing ideas (e.g. PluralityLabs sensing exercise) and discussions across various groups. The initiative aims to consolidate these efforts and create a strategy that can be ratified by the DAO to foster greater alignment and collaboration.
Synergy and Focus: By identifying and concentrating on specific strategic areas, the initiative intends to create synergies between different projects and sharpen the DAO’s focus both in internal resource allocation and comms and positioning.
Careful stakeholder consideration: the initiative proposes to include a careful assessment of stakeholders (building on top of PluralityLab’s work) and ensure the different stakeholders are well represented in the strategy-making process.
Feedback Loops: The strategy encourages ongoing evaluation and adaptation, using insights from KPI assessments to refine and evolve strategic objectives.
Community Engagement: Effective channels for questions and discussions are emphasized to ensure the community’s involvement and input into the strategic process (ensuring critical reflection of implications to prevent a backlash at the implementation phase).

Conclusion

The initiative is positioned as a foundational effort to align the DAO around a shared strategy, optimize resource allocation, and enhance collaboration within the ecosystem.
By focusing on strategic planning with a comprehensive set of stakeholders and the effective use of KPIs, the initiative aims to streamline operations, clarify objectives, and maximize the impact of the DAO’s activities.

Next Steps:

We aim to prepare, gather feedback on, and agree on a process for strategy-making for the DAO. Enabling us to leverage EthDenver as a key occasion to advance this process.
More concrete next steps to be defined (see how to get involved).

Hopes
How would strategy help you personally? (points after voting)
TL;DR: mostly Efficiency and Effectiveness

My governance team would know what they’d need to focus on for our Arbitrum Contributions for that particular timeframe.(6)
Confidence to bet my time, skills, effort towards a strategy I agree looks promising & my skillset is fit to contribute to. (5)
Allows us to move faster, we don’t have to realign on strategy and higher level thinking every time we have a decision. (4)
We wouldnt end up doing work that others have already done. (3)
it would help me justify my votes as a delegate, I sometimes need a reference point that I could use instead of my best judgement (3)
Feel I would have to work less - the DAO wouldn’t be as exhausted because we have agreement. (3)
Shit gets done more efficiently. Instead of focusing on Quantity of proposals, we can focus on less, harmonise, and get stuff done quicker [Increase in quality is expected as well due to more harmonised and focused participation on a particular set of tasks for ex.] (2)
Not just a list of strategies but prioritized so that stakeholders have clarity on what the DAO should focus on (2)
Will give us much needed ‘north stars’ to ladder up into. Especially for KPIs / OKRs / whatever we land on. Streamline conversation. (2)
The ability to easy-track fund things optimistically (2)
Easier to align with other delegates and stakeholders (2)
I personally think we might need a plurality of strategies (2)
More effective proposals in line with what we actually need could be worked on with this as we’d have a direction to strive towards.(1)

Fears
What Concerns do you have?

We can’t get agreement on the strategy (5)
The DAO wont fund work like this and encourage contributors like us to keep building.(5)
The DAO stops funding anything outside the strategic pillars and this kills outside-in innovation (makes the DAO too rigid) (4)
ratifying for the DAO as a whole vs ratifying for a subgovernance structure (4)
The term “Strategy” doesn’t resonate with our community (gives too corporate association) (3)
Strategy becomes focused in the hands of the powerful few builders (3)
that most of the key players in the DAO will not be aware of its existence - like in Optimism most people have no idea of what Optimistic Vision is and what’s the background of RPGF (3)
That we don’t have a representative sample of delegates in the meeting. (2)
What if the strategy doesn’t work? (2)
removing autonomy before it starts working (1)
The PL strategic framework was not ratified by the DAO (1)
This initiative could be viewed as a blocker to other work that may or may not fit within the goals of the DAO (1)

20947,Bob-Rossi,2024-02-04 03:43:49,"Just got a chance to read the proposal as presented here. Thank you to you and everyone who has put in time and effort to bring forth this proposal. ‘Cat-herding’ a decentralized group is always going to be a tricky task.
As a general idea, I think the idea of setting a framework for the DAO is a good one. DAOs are interesting because they sort of just appear into the world and the expectation is for it to self-govern itself into a long-term and sustainable entity. It is pretty interesting to see social and market forces result in any form of governance at all. ARB is now coming up on 1 year of existence and I think it’s a good time to reflect on where the DAO has been and where it will end up being. So having this conversation about frameworks seems to be a logical step in the DAO’s evolution. I’m glad to see the discussion being had.
Specific to the proposal, I’ll address the two questions asked:


Is it clear and understandable?


With the caveat I understand the initial discussions are bound to be very broad in scope until the project has had time to narrow it’s scope, there is a lot going on here. To the point I’m guess I’m not sure what the community expected input is here. I apologize if this is maybe my own shortcomings in understanding, but the original post seems to want to start a discussion on setting up a framework. However, the discussion on the framework and implementation seems all over the place.
Maybe as a starting point - The implementation points to defining a set of strategic pillars, yet the graphic and theory section discuss ‘Layer Artefacts’. Which seem to function in a way that I would expect pillars to be defined. Is there maybe more detail on what you would define a “Pillar” as, especially as to how it would be differentiated from the artefact layers?


Would you support Arbitrum DAO using it or what would you change?


I’d like to see what the final product looks like after revisions and community discussion, but I see no reason not to continue the work on this.",6
20947,danielo,2024-02-06 00:40:19,"Thanks a lot for your comments.
I understand the framework looks very broad. The idea is that we focus on defining just a few urgent components of it, but then we have a framework that is compatible with a much broader and longer scope of work, so we’re not having to redo everything soon after.
To ease the confusion, some of the strategic pillars could be:

specific verticals to focus on in building Swarms (see here our work on this topic so far)
key capabilities: e.g. great developer support
key technologies to develop
or new business models like e.g. licensing the tech stack

So the distinction is between, on one side, essential organizational functions that must be animated to ensure viability but could be just hygiene factors, and on the other side, the areas to double down on.
Note that one of the pillars could be doubling down on a specific Layer. If, e.g., having a strong, cohesive identity was key, then that would be a pillar to double down on (e.g., ideologically driven groups like organized religions emphasize this) or a pillar could also be focusing on the Coordiantion layer as it’s deemed that the key for success in the case of Arbitrum will be coordination between units/projects.
Does that make sense?",7
20947,Bob-Rossi,2024-02-11 01:25:58,"Appreciate the breakdown. It for sure makes some more sense and I’ll keep my eyes out as this grows. I think with that it will become a lot clearer to me, as admittedly I am the type of person who does a lot better understanding when there is a tangible thing to read / view / touch / ect.",8
20947,JupiterBlock,2024-02-15 19:56:26,"This is a very interesting initiative. My own research last Fall about a potential decentralized risk management framework led me to inventory general DAO-related research to develop a risk taxonomy, and I had noted that DAOs have strategy and management gaps. Coming from a traditional organizations background (aka lawyer), and then studying recommended good practices for risk management and governance of large public companies, I must say that DAOs face some of the same complex and costly issues, as well as many others - as an example, DAO participants need to invest a lot of time to track emergence and also face personal liability risks if they take “too much” leadership. Perhaps the most useful from my perspective was the research of how cooperatives deal with things, as well as systems thinking approaches, and I would recommend those be explored in priority (I am of course continuing my own research and will share as available). Decentralization can only be maintained by good design and constant iteration (aka “open systems design”), as well as training DAO members for certain key roles. Therefore, areas such as risk, designing key units and roles,  tracking emergence, and training are essential from my perspective.",9
20947,danielo,2024-02-18 15:43:20,"Diving deeper into the methodology to propose to define Strategic Pillars, I wrote this post to share the research we’ve been doing at RnDAO on this topic and why we currently find Citizen Assemblies to be the best-suited approach for our purpose here. Would love to know your thoughts!




When does voting leads to bad outcomes? Governance


    You might’ve heard the saying, “great minds think alike!” That couldn’t be further from the truth. 
Many of the most productive partnerships throughout history worked precisely because two great minds thought differently in complementary ways. Case in point: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Jobs was more sales-minded and more of a “big picture” guy, while Wozniak was the more technical electronics guru. Clearly, their partnership worked out well for Apple — despite (or likely because) the two Steve…

20947,danielo,2024-03-06 20:55:15,"During EthDenver, we had about 20 conversations with delegates, builders, and other stakeholders.
Our sentiment is that this initiative, although highly valuable, is not the lowest-hanging fruit for the DAO. As such, we’re considering pausing it.
We have developed and refined a method for how the strategic process could work. And this work has been published as part of the GovHack and remains a resource we can leverage when the DAO is ready to move forward with it.

Proposal: AIP-1: Arbitrum Improvement Proposal Framework

Vote: Against
Rationale: We voted against this proposal due to the lack of transparency and rationale behind many of the aspects of the proposal including the “special grants” and the 750M ARB allocation. We would like to see this proposal broken into smaller proposals so they can be discussed with the community.

Proposal: AIP 1.05: Return 700M $ARB to the DAO Treasury [REAL]

Vote: Against
Rationale: While sending the 750M ARB could have been communicated more effectively, It is reasonable to give the Arbitrum Foundation runway for the next few years, especially with the implementation of AIP 1.1 providing more structure and security to the funds.

Rationale: This is a duplicate proposal see our rationale for the original AIP 1.05.

Proposal: AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency

Vote: For
Rationale: It is important to ensure a proper budget is in place so the foundation is held to a high standard and can have adequate runway for the next few years. It is also vital for the Foundation funds to be transparent to prevent mismanagement.

Proposal: AIP-1.2 - Foundation and DAO Governance

Vote: For
Rationale: We support the initiative to create a constitution that creates accountability and provides transparency. We also support changing the proposal threshold from 5M to 1M ARB",2

Procurement Framework | Security : Non-Constitutional Proposal

AIP: ArbOS Version 11
Vote: For
Rationale: StableLab supports these improvements to the Arbitrum chains.
Proposal to Backfund Successful STIP Proposals
Vote: Against
Rationale: StableLab would have preferred a full round 2 as opposed to a backfund as we believe that would have been a more fair way to include additional protocols in an incentives program. We also believe many aspects of this proposal such as the timeline were not adequately considered before going to a vote. However, since the community has demonstrated their desire for the backfund, we will be happy to manage this program and will work hard to ensure it runs smoothly.
Timeline Extension for STIP and Backfund Grantees

However, with the gaming incentives program moving toward a vote we think it would make sense for this proposal to be included in that program considering the potential size of the gaming initiative.
Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0

Introduction and Experience
karpatkey is a DeFi-native organisation specialising in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with GnosisDAO, Balancer, ENS, CoW Protocol, and Lido on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions.
Why karpatkey
The Arbitrum DAO is well-positioned to lead by taking community-driven governance initiatives and turning them into highly impactful programs that strengthen the protocol’s future.
At karpatkey, our governance team taps our network of engineers, DeFi strategists, data/financial/quant analysts, and accountants for subject matter expertise. As DAO treasury developers and contributors to some of our industry’s most reputable DeFi protocols, our team has the knowledge, trust, and alignment to contribute to Arbitrum’s growth moving forward meaningfully.
We pride ourselves on being hands-on delegates in our areas of expertise and upholding our core values in every area of our participation.
In addition to our well-known DeFi and Treasury-related skills, we are interested in making an impact in broader DAO governance discussions, such as delegate incentive programs as discussed in [RFC-2] and taking a more active role in the Arbitrum Incentive Program Working Group. Our governance team is already attending the weekly Arbitrum calls, recently attended DAO Day spaces, and is committed to increasing involvement.
Delegate Communication Intent
This thread will provide regular updates to the community to ensure transparency and fully communicate our rationale as delegates. These updates will include our explanation for voting and may consist of other announcements related to our activity as an Arbitrum delegate.
Disclosure
We are active contributors to the governance of other protocols, such as AAVE, Uniswap, and Safe. We also manage treasuries or serve on treasury committees for protocols such as Balancer, GnosisDAO, and ENS, and we hold multiple crypto assets in our own treasury. More information is freely available on our treasury reports.

Proposal:Pilot program Council Elections
Vote: Abstain
Reasoning: We have abstained from this proposal because we are nominees for a seat on this council.

Proposal: Pilot Program Advisor Elections
Vote: Boardroom, JoJo and SeedLATAM
Reasoning: The advisor role is critical for the LTIPP. While all the available candidates are well-qualified, our final selection reflects our belief that these advisors will provide unbiased and high-quality support for LTIPP applicants. Our selection of Boardroom, JoJo, and SeedLatam represents our trust in these candidates based on their current work with the Arbitrum DAO and also their history of work in other communities.

Proposal: Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal
Vote: Increase the threshold to 9/12
Reasoning: Given the similar signer’s configuration on both safes, this option makes more sense operationally. It is simpler and does not compromise the security.",2

Proposal: Election of Procurement Committee Members (ADPC)
Vote: 33.3% for Joseph [immutablelawyer], 33.3% for Paul Imseih [pablo], Bernard Schmid [bernard]
Reasoning: While we recognize that all candidates had a strong profile and would be a good fit, our approach for this election was to pick candidates with complementary skills and experiences to compose the committee. In our view, @immutablelawyer, @pablo, and @bernard represent the best choices for this strategy.

Proposal: [Constitutional] Changes to the Constitution and the Security Council Election Process 
Vote: For
Reasoning: We support these election procedure changes as they ensure a fair process, giving all candidates the same exposure. The other additional procedures (message signing and constitution text changes) also address known issues.

Reasoning: We are members of the proposed screening committee and, therefore, have abstained.

We are excited to announce that it won’t be long until the start of the program. Since December, we have been collecting a lot of data from delegates to see how impactful their participation was and how we can make significant improvements from now on.
During our work, we have done an exploration of the delegates data to determine the exact participation of each delegate on all tally votes, with the exception of the test proposals and that ones with the [OLD] prefix, here below you can see our previous tests corresponding to the December and January months:
December 2023



Experimental Delegate Incentive Test #1 Governance


    Following the recent approval of the delegate incentive proposal in tally, we did an initial test with the objective of showing the workflow at a high level and having an overview of the delegate participation status. 
Incentive compensation criteria
As the proposal states, certain rules must be complied with in order to obtain compensation at the end of each month. These are as follows: 
1. Voting Power Greater than 50,000 Voting ARB Tokens: According to the information collected from this dune,…

FAQ and Best Practices Guide for the Delegate Incentive Program

Can delegates enroll in the program at any time?
Yes, delegates can enroll in the program at any time, provided they meet the requirements specified in this document . To apply, please refer to the enrollment thread available here .
When does a delegate’s participation become effective if they subscribe at any time?
To minimize the potential for program manipulation, delegates who register before the third day of the month will be included for the incentive calculations of the current month. This three-day margin, approximately 10% of the month, is set as the maximum grace period for those delegates who wish to join the incentive program at the time of their registration. Those who register after the third day will be considered for the program starting the following month.


Also you can check the collected data on this Karma dashboard
This website was created by Karma and checked by the SEED Latam team.
If you see any error, do not hesitate to notify us and we will fix it as soon as possible. We invite delegates and participants to check it out to make it as transparent as possible.
We determined some parameters to see how impactful delegates are for our protocol. That’s why we take into consideration Snapshot and Tally Votings (SV & TV). Also, we wanted to see how delegates communicate their decisions, so we considered another two parameters: Communication Rationale (CR) and Commenting Proposals (CP).
These months of collecting raw data were a lot of work for our team. Luckily, integration with our friends of Karma will make things much easier once the program starts.
We are still receiving feedback from the community. Please let us know if you have doubts or ideas that will improve the program!

How long must the delegate have >50k ARB voting power?
Upon enrollment in the program, and throughout each month, delegates must ensure that they maintain, for at least 85% of the monthly duration, a VP equal or greater than 50k ARB. This translates to maintaining the required VP for a minimum of 25 days per month. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the delegate not being considered for the program for the current month and subsequent months until they manage to restore their VP to the required level and maintain it above 85% of the time.
What is the consideration period for proposals that delegates must vote or comment on?
Proposals that conclude within a specific month will be counted as part of the performance indicators for that same month. This applies to both Snapshot and Tally voting.
To illustrate, let’s take January 2024 as an example:

Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal: This Snapshot proposal started on January 18 and ended on January 25. Any comments or rationale provided by the delegates about this proposal will be considered for the month of January.
Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establishment of the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee: This Tally proposal began on January 21 and ends on February 4. Comments and rationales from the delegates regarding this proposal will be considered for the month of February.

This system ensures that the contributions of delegates are correctly attributed to the corresponding month, based on the conclusion date of each proposal.
What should the delegate understand by Commenting Proposals (CP)?
We expect delegates to comment on and/or provide feedback to proposals both before and during the voting process. Comments and feedback should be aimed at fostering debate, enhancing the proposal, or clarifying questions not explicitly addressed in the proposal itself. We rely on the goodwill of delegates to avoid spam and meaningless comments/feedback.

Key Point: Comments or feedback that violate any community guidelines will not be taken into consideration. It’s essential that all interactions contribute constructively to the deliberation and improvement of proposals.

What should the delegate understand by Communicating Rationale (CR)?
It is crucial for delegates to share the reasoning behind their vote during or after the conclusion of a proposal. This rationale can be posted either in the delegate’s communication thread (if they have one) or in the proposal’s discussion thread itself. To adhere to best practices, we recommend that delegates communicate their voting intention and rationale as soon as possible after casting their vote.
Examples of rationale communication:

Rationale posted in the delegate’s communication thread.
Rationale posted in the proposal’s discussion thread.

Given the voting process in the DAO, where voting typically first occurs on Snapshot and then on Tally, it’s understandable that delegates may keep the same voting stance in both stages. It’s reasonable for delegates not to issue a new rationale for the second stage if it was already provided during the first stage (Snapshot) and their position remains unchanged. In these cases, we simply expect delegates to indicate that they have maintained their vote based on the previously expressed rationale.
How do I communicate my rationale if a proposal ends on the last day of the month?
In exceptional circumstances, such as when a proposal concludes on the last day of the month, we understand it may be challenging for delegates to vote and communicate their rationale within the same monthly period. To accommodate these situations, an extension of up to 3 days after the end of the month will be granted, allowing delegates to post their voting intentions and rationales to be counted for the respective month.
How should delegates calculate the Participation rate (PR)?
The participation rate for delegates will be determined through the dashboard provided by Karma, specifically designed to measure each interested delegate’s participation in Tally. To prevent manipulation of the system, the PR will be calculated based on the DAO’s voting history (excluding tests and [OLD] tags).
Only votes that conclude by the last day of the current month will be considered for the PR calculation. This means a proposal that starts in January and ends in February will not be counted towards January’s PR calculation, even if voted on in January.

Note: In future iterations of the program (as decided by the DAO), this criterion could be adjusted to an average of the last 90 or 120 days of voting activity. This adjustment aims to lower the entry barriers to the program.

How can I earn Bonus Points (BP)?
As outlined in the proposal, at the end of each month, delegates who have submitted proposals of significant impact to the DAO (such as L2BEAT with its proposal on security council changes) will have the opportunity to earn bonus points (up to a maximum of 30%) which will be added to their final score for the month.
It’s crucial to emphasize that this bonus will only be awarded to proposals that do not have funds allocated to the creator, aiming to prevent double funding within the DAO.
What if the delegation had to change accounts?
In cases such as Gauntlet’s, it is important to report your situation in the forum so that both wallets are taken into account when calculating the delegation score. In your specific case, the combined Tally votes from both accounts reached the 25% Participation Rate (PR) required to be eligible for the program. It is important to stay active.
How should delegate platforms with 2 or more members representing an entity submit their application?
Delegate platforms with 2 or more members must state in their application who are the members (forum profile) who will be the voice of the platform.
Example:

Best Practices
During the process of creating and testing this delegate incentive system, we realized that there are certain actions that improve program performance and delegates’ opportunities to earn incentives. Therefore, we would like to share the following best practices:


Actively participate in Snapshot and Tally voting: This contributes greatly to the final result of each month. The more votes you participate, the more participation you will have at the end of the month. It is important to note that only participation is taken into account, not vote choice, i.e. if a delegate votes for, against or abstains, regardless of their choice, it will be taken into account in the final tally.


Express your voting intention in the forum or in a delegate communication thread: In order to facilitate the delegate count, we suggest that delegates communicate their voting intention as a comment in the forum or in a communication thread of their choice. It is important to clarify that both Snapshot and Tally voting intentions must be communicated, as both are considered for the final count.

An example of this practice is the delegation of  @GFXlabs , which has a communication thread where it expresses all its voting intentions for the month.
image769×593 43.1 KB



Avoid spam comments: The proposal indicates that comments that are considered high impact or that contribute to the debate will be counted and will be part of the final score. However, it is important to clarify that repetitive comments or comments that contribute nothing to the debate will be ignored for these purposes.


Make CR and CP communications within the relevant deadlines: We have observed that there are some delegates who communicate their voting intentions several days or weeks after they have voted. Therefore, we recommend that delegates try to communicate their voting intentions as soon as possible after voting so that there are no problems during the final tally. Late comments may affect the final score for the month.


Adding the communicated rationale directly in the snapshot vote: When a delegate votes in snapshot, he has the possibility to add the link of his rationale directly in the vote, which greatly facilitates the final accounting of the snapshot votes and the communication rationale in one step. 852×285 23 KB


Conclusions
The incentive system is quite a challenge, during the process of building the data table we encountered multiple situations which gave us the motivation to create this informative document. There is a possibility that some questions may be missing, so we invite all delegates to continue to ask questions about the program to make this doc more and more complete.
We would like to know the feedback from the delegates",1

13895,cattin,2023-04-15 17:52:18,"
AIP-1
Hey everyone,
@cattin here, representing SEEDLatam and L2 en Español, after discussing this AIP with our community during our first governance call carried out in our Discord, we decided to vote AGAINST AIP-1, for the reasons stated below.

Rationale
As a self-sustaining organization that encompasses other communities, each with different interests, we understand how difficult it is to have clear communication in these scenarios where there is a lot to do (airdrop, forming the DAO, maintaining decentralization, etc.), nobody said that running and forming a DAO was an easy task.
Therefore, we want to thank @stonecoldpat for his post “Clarity around the ratification of AIP-1” which brought more clarity to what is happening in ArbitrumDAO to our community.
However, this does not remove the great dissatisfaction of the community that was expressed during our governance call regarding this situation. Additionally, we believe that AIP-1 encompasses several proposals together which should be voted on and dealt with separately, as it has already been recognized in the latest statement made by Arbitrum on twitter.
While we understand that this is not now a “proposal” but rather a “ratification” of the initial DAO configuration, we will express the will of the Latam community on each point.

On Special Grants
We believe that this point is very vaguely explained, although it is clarified that the Special Grants process and criteria will be published in the future, we do not believe that voting for this point now is correct.
Establishing the scope of these Special Grants and the processes we believe is crucial, as these are funds intended for organizations/institutions or individuals who have somehow helped or supported the Arbitrum ecosystem. We believe that transparency in the processes and that those funds truly have an impact that benefits the Arbitrum ecosystem is really important.

On Directors
We understand that at this point there is a legal and regulatory margin that is beyond our reach and it is necessary for Arbitrum Foundation to assign its board.
However, we would like to have more information regarding the names mentioned before proceeding with this proposal or at least for Offchain Labs/Arbitrum explain why these directors where elected, with some background about them. Also, these directors could introduce themselves in the forum as such, explaining what’s their background, what relationship they have t0 Arbitrum/Offchain Labs, etc. It is important to maintain trust among all parties that make up Arbitrum DAO, the DAO as such has the right to know who is behind this Foundation and why they were appointed.

On the Security Council
On this point, there’s nothing we would really change, just congratulations to Patricio Worthalter for being part of the Council, since he’s pretty close to our community and an important voice from our region. Our community members are big fans of POAP, and we are proud that this attestation tool has emerged from this side of the world!

On the Data Availability Committee (Arbitrum Nova chain only)
Regarding the Data Availability Committee, we would like to have more clarity on the selection criteria of each member and their relationship with Offchain Labs.
We also believe that it is necessary to vote on a removal or appointment process, just in case there’s a scenario where one member should be replaced, such as what happened last year with FTX.

On The Arbitrum Foundation Administrative Budget Wallet
This is what has generated the most debate and dissatisfaction, on the one hand, it is not an exorbitant amount for a DAO Foundation since they have to pay administrative costs and grant funding as mentioned earlier. On this point, our community is completely in favor of the Foundation being funded, and we don’t necessarily have any issues with the amount requested. The problem here, as mentioned earlier, is communication.
We consider that it’s too risky to have 7.5% of the total supply on a multisig, we know this is unlikely to happen, but after what happened with Ronin we don’t think we should run the risk. This allocation should be distributed gradually, and discussed in a separate proposal, with proper guidelines on how these funds are going to be used and what roles would the directors have in all of this. The main issue we had, as a community, is the way that arbitrum carried this out, doing first and asking for permission later. Even if it was just a “ratification”, then at least they should’ve been transparent since day 1 about the Foundation’s wallet being funded at the time of the distribution and regarding funds going to a market maker, which again, we don’t see an issue with this, but we simply don’t understand why couldn’t this be communicated openly in a transparent way.

So how should we proceed?
To fix this error and due to everything that has happened during this temperature check, we believe that if the proposal is rejected, Arbitrum should take another approach, go point by point, and have it voted on by Arbitrum DAO.

Conclusion
Our community is convinced that we are in time to remedy the first misstep that Arbitrum has taken. On the other hand, we are also pleased with the general reactions, we believe that this type of situation is always good for progressing as an ecosystem, we are in very early stages and it’s better to make these mistakes now than later.
Finally, we want to thank our community, more than 60 members showed up to our governance call, and also thank you to our contributors and delegates @axlvaz_SEEDLATAM.eth @Manugotsu_SEEDLatam @SEED_Latam_Joxes @Phenrril @Noa and @ArbiGod.eth for participating and helping us form this statement.

About: AIP-1.05 - Return 700M $ARB to the DAO Treasury
Our vote is against.
To learn about the voting procedure of SEEDLatam and L2 en Español, you can read it here.
Rationale
We believe this proposal is unnecessary and seems more like a power play that could cause legal and reputational harm to the Arbitrum Foundation and, consequently, the DAO. It is worth clarifying that we voted against AIP-1 for the reasons we clarified in this forum. We consider it is time to move forward and not fall into situations that hinder growth since AI-1.1 and 1.2 address the main issues of AIP-1.
Details
Our main reasons to vote agains this proposal are the following:



The Foundation has unilaterally been allocated $750M tokens from the DAO that was not approved by the governance token holders.

This is clarified in the Transparency report: Initial foundation setup and detailed in the AIP-1.1 in the Smart Contract Lockup and Operating Budget section.



Return 700M $ARB from the Foundation to the DAO as a symbolic gesture that the governance token holders hold ultimate power and authority over the resources that were granted to the DAO

As we mentioned earlier, this is an unnecessary step and delays the launch of the Arbitrum Foundation. We believe that funding the Foundation is necessary for the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.



Buyback $ARB via Wintermute with whatever fiat is left from the $10M OTC sale

This action entails unnecessary expenses, and we do not know the legal and regulatory scope of such actions. We must be cautious as the ecosystem is under the scrutiny of regulators.



Disclose terms of the market making deal with Wintermute

We understand that there is a signed legal agreement; this could create unnecessary conflict between the parties. In addition, it would undermine the seriousness and reputation of the Arbitrum Foundation, which could affect future agreements with other entities/institutions or individuals.


Conclusion
Our community previously expressed its anger by voting against AIP-1. Now they consider that the Foundation has set things right with AIP-1.1, AIP-1.2, and the Transparency report: Initial foundation setup. This proposal does not contribute to the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, which is one of our pillars expressed in the Delegate Statement, but rather delays it.

AIP-1.1
Hello everyone,
On Thursday 13 we had our 2nd governance call at SEEDLatam in collaboration with L2 en Español where we discussed with our community the ongoing proposals:

AIP-1.05 - Return 700M $ARB to the DAO Treasury
AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency
AIP-1.2 - Foundation and DAO Governance

Participants: 60 attendees
Duration: 1h

Our voting procedure
True to our ethos, we went through each proposal and explained them in detail to our community. Then the debate was opened for community members to express their opinions on each proposal. Finally, each proposal was voted on individually by community members present in our discord.
Direct collaborators @axlvaz_SEEDLATAM.eth @Manugotsu_SEEDLatam @SEED_Latam_Joxes @Phenrril @MCamere and @Noa also expressed their opinions. We want to thank the regional delegates, @ArbiGod.eth, who joined the debate and contributed their opinions.
As always, any member of this DAO who wants to participate in our governance calls and is open to discussing Arbitrum-related issues is more than welcome.

About: AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency
Our vote is in favor.

Rationale
AIP-1.1 addresses and resolves most of the requests we made previously. However, despite our favorable vote, we want to express the opinion of our community on each point.

About Smart Contract Lockup
We believe it is a wise decision to lock funds in a smart contract. It also restores DAO control over funds by allowing adjustments to future funding and/or modifying the unlock schedule.

About Operating Budget
The community was satisfied with the presentation and description of the operating budget. However, they expressed a desire for future budgets to be more detailed in terms of expenses and aligned with the goals of the Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO.

About Ecosystem Growth Initiatives
In this point, we had requested more details in the previous proposal. We believe the focus and objectives for growth initiatives are better clarified. Although the application and approval process still needs detailing, SEEDLatam and L2 en Español are available to collaborate in the development of these processes, considering the experience of some of our members in such initiatives.

Transparency Reports
Our community was more than satisfied with this transparency report, which provides a description of The Arbitrum Foundation directors and details the initial costs of establishing The Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO. However, the relationship with OffChain Labs and the selection criteria for the Nova Network Data Availability Committee remains a bit obscure.

Conclusion
Although some points still need clarification, AIP-1.1 mostly resolves all previously expressed doubts, and this is not an impediment to voting in favor. Our community believes it is time for Arbitrum to take the next step, and for them, the official launch of the Foundation is essential.

About: AIP-1.2 - Foundation and DAO Governance
Our vote is in favor .
To learn about the voting procedure of SEEDLatam and L2 en Español, you can read it here.
Rationale
After the rejection of AIP-1, amendments to the Constitution and the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of The Arbitrum Foundation (the “A&R M&A”) and the Bylaws are necessary. These are the foundation for the orderly development of the Foundation and the ArbitrumDAO.
We will express some comments.
Amendments to the Constitution



Make explicit that the DAO may make a Non-Constitutional Funding AIP with respect to the Administrative Budget Wallet.

We believe it is important for the DAO to have the ability and can make AIPs on the Administrative Budget Wallet. This gives more legitimacy to the ArbitrumDAO.



Lower the threshold number of Votable Tokens required for an AIP to be posted on-chain from 5,000,000 $ARB to 1,000,000 $ARB.

Contributes to the decentralization of the DAO, we believe it is an appropriate value.



Add a new Section 5, which details the Data Availability Committee, including processes for removing and appointing Data Availability Committee members.

As we clarified in AIP-1 and AIP-1.1, we would like the relationship between OffChain Labs and the Data Availability Committee to be detailed. We would also like to know the criteria for selection.


Amendments to the Bylaws
The majority of the points mentioned have already been resolved; our community is more than satisfied.
Modifications to the A&R M&A
Nothing to comment on.
Conclusion
As we mentioned earlier, these amendments are necessary to continue the orderly path towards the launch of the Arbitrum Foundation.

Arbitrum DAO Grants - Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook
We voted in favor
To learn about the voting procedure of SEEDLatam and L2 en Español, you can read it here.
Rationale
As a community, we agreed that this was a reasonable grant program - it was approved with 17 votes in favor, 3 abstentions, and 0 votes against. However, there’s one thing we think could be discussed further once the proposal is approved and that’s related to the Domains.
Domains
Currently, there are four domains offered by Questbook: Gaming, Developer Tooling on NOVA, New Protocol Ideas and Education, Community Growth and Events. We support the concept of doing this program as oriented as possible towards ecosystem development, however, we believe some of these Domains might not be the best ones right now.
We wouldn’t remove gaming since it does bring a lot of adoption. But we do think we could change Developer Tooling on Nova for something more generalized towards the development of Arbitrum Orbit, especially since we’re currently competing with OP Stack, so Orbit could benefit from this extra support. Then we wouldn’t remove New Protocol Ideas, but it would be good to verify that the Foundation isn’t working on something similar. Finally, we would remove Education, Community Growth and Events since we don’t consider this essential right now plus its impact is pretty difficult to measure within a grants program - we could instead have a Domain dedicated to research and development of account abstraction on Arbitrum.
Conclusion
We strongly support this proposal but we think there could be some improvements related to the Domains mentioned.",7

Participants: 34 attendees.
Duration: 30min
About: Fund the Arbitrum Grants Framework Proposal Milestone 1
We voted against
To learn about the voting procedure of SEEDLatam and L2 en Español, you can read it here.
Rationale
Plurality Labs proposed an open grant framework requiring 3.971M ARB. The Seedlatam community voted against it because we believe that the proposal lacks more detail regarding the percentages of the funds allocated, and we think that the metrics need to be clarified in order to make the grant program as optimal as possible.
Here are some comments from our community:
Plurality Labs Role
We appreciate the great effort and dedication of Plurality Labs and believe that they have all the qualities to be able to create a good grants program for the ecosystem, but we consider that both Gitcoin and Questbook are reputable entities with the operational capacity to run their grants programs without relying on third parties.
In the same way, we would like more details on how the parameters for incorporating smaller grant teams into your program to participate in the program and how they will be managed by Plurality labs.
Gitcoin and Plurality Labs
Our community is a big fan of Gitcoin, we recognize and admire the team and all their work on web3. But we are aware that it is important to make clear the position of Plurality Labs in a conflict of interest scenario because we see that Plurality Labs has several members who belong or belonged to Gitcoin.
Therefore, in the event of a conflict of interest, a robust and detailed system should be in place to ensure the impartiality of Plurality Labs. Considering as DAO members we must always prioritize the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Lack of details
Our community expressed strong concerns about these percentages:



AIP - 3 [Non-Constitutional] Fund the Arbitrum Grants Framework Proposal Milestone 1


2.6 million ARB (72%): Funding Arbitrum ecosystem development
450k ARB (12.5%): Plurality Labs Services
260k ARB (7.2%): Grant Program Managers
300k ARB (8.3%): Matching Gitcoin funding pools using Arbitrum
361k ARB project buffer*



According to multiple opinions within our community, we believe that the percentage associated with the administration of the grant program is pretty high, so it would make sense to have more details on the expenses required related to running this grant program. We believe that a breakdown such as the one presented by Questbook would be a good way to clear these doubts.
Additionally, metrics are missing regarding how the funds will be distributed and the scope of the funds once they are received. The community believes that these aspects should be reinforced to increase the value of this proposal.
Considerations
We believe that grant programs are definitely necessary at this stage and we would like to see the DAOs treasury used to further its goals. However, we believe it is necessary for the grant program to be aligned with the Arbitrum Foundation and the DAO to ensure the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. This will result in attracting more users who are truly motivated to build by the development of arbitrum as an ecosystem rather than opportunistic farmers. We consider that Plurality Labs is a great team but we would like to have more details about their programs considering the amount of funds required.",9

Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders
We voted Against
To learn about the voting procedure of SEEDLatam and L2 en Español, you can read it here.
Rationale
The main issue with this proposal is the precedent it would create, if the DAO feels like Arbitrum needs to introduce liquidity incentive programs it should be done through a generalized program enabling any DEX to participate - there isn’t really a reason as to why we should pick a winner.
We don’t think that Arbitrum needs liquidity incentives at the moment, it’s current situation isn’t really comparable to Optimism’s when they decided to provide liquidity incentives through Velodrome. Which in turn didn’t result in sticky TVL and mostly resulted in short term mercenary capital - which could be the case if this proposal was to be approved.
We believe that it would make more sense to use the DAOs treasury to support the ecosystem’s development and its builders than simply using funds to support a proposal that would benefit a single protocol and not provide much to the whole ecosystem.
Conclusion

Liquidity incentives shouldn’t be a priority right now.
If the DAO wants to support them, it should do so in a generalized + meritocratic way.
We don’t see how this proposal would benefit the ecosystem.

Rationale
We believe that the implementation of this proposal is essential to guarantee a transparent and frictionless process for electing the new members of ArbitrumDAO’s security council. We understand the complexity related to smart contracts and that sometimes, unfortunately, code won’t reflect what’s written in the constitution since there might be time constraints due to necessary audits - so having a more flexible date seems reasonable in this case.

Rationale
Even though we initially voted against this proposal during the temperature check, we consider the modifications implemented between the temperature check and the onchain execution of said proposal to be good enough to support it, for the following reasons:

Implementing the Zodiaz module and a 4/6 multisig with 4 members of the DAO and 2 members of Plurality Labs helps make the program more capture resistant, especially since the DAO has the power to remove signers of said multisig.
They significantly reduced the amount asked from the DAO, which makes the financial downside of this program considerably low if it fails compared to the potential upside involved in having a successful grant program.
Some metrics were added, which still remain a bit broad and could potentially be narrowed down a bit, but we understand it’s not easy to have specific goals for a broad program.

Conclusion
The modifications implemented make the program capture resistant and with a low financial risk for the DAO, making it reasonable and worth trying.",13

Rationale
Since this wasn’t really a traditional proposal, our approach to it had to vary a bit. As a delegation, we took the time to write summaries of each candidate and then review each of them individually with our own community, before proceeding to a vote for each domain. We also invited nominees to join our call and pitch themselves to our communities, so that they could have a chance to learn more about the proposals - to this, we just want to say thank you to all of those who made it to our call and managed to even translate their docs to Spanish.
Once our community had an informed opinion on each individual candidate, we proceeded with the voting. One thing to note is that even though our community voted in favor of us proceeding with a self-vote, we left it as a final recourse, but didn’t use this in the end.

Rationale
Given the fact that liquidity incentive proposals are still to be proven to be efficient, we believe that the DAO currently is at a stage in which it can take the liberty to experiment with these programs and learn what could be improved in order to ensure that incentives proposals avoid attracting mercenary capital + keep a sticky TVL.
We also believe this is a good way to have a more generalized approach towards incentivizing liquidity, instead of simply prioritizing specific protocols over others. Making it more fair for current protocols and also less conflicting.
Conclusion
We’re looking forward to the implementation of this incentive proposal, we feel that the DAO is in a good position to start experimenting with liquidity incentives and the amounts asked for seem reasonable.",17

Due to the surge in current and upcoming activities in ArbitrumDAO, and as we previously indicated, my delegation, along with the @SEEDLatam and L2 en Español teams, are reorganizing to efficiently manage the workload and keep up with governance decisions.
For this reason, we’ve assigned @SEEDGov and some members of our team to analyze the proposals from the Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal). Meanwhile, @seedlatam and I will be focused on the Security Council Elections 101 and the Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook - Arbitrum DAO Grants…
Our primary goal with this organization is to stay informed about all the crucial decisions in ArbitrumDAO and convey accurate information to our community, which constantly supports us in decision-making.

If you missed our governance call you can watch it here
Rationale
As a Latin American delegation, we’re very excited to vote in favor of a proposal of this sort - we strongly believe that promoting IRL events and conferences will help increase education on Arbitrum and L2s in the region, potentially bringing the next wave of users & builders. Also, considering how strong the presence of some alt-L1’s is in the region, we should encourage more events of this sort to bring more awareness to Ethereum L2s and how Arbitrum offers a better experience for users (both in safety and ecosystem-wise).
Apart from this we also wanted to mention that it might be possible to simply pass this proposal through our QuestBook Domain (following the due process of course), which could be easier for the DAO and grantees - this of course if the Domain is live by this week. We would’ve done this before, but since we weren’t sure on the timeline and knowing that ETH Mexico starts in ~20 days, we decided to pass it through governance too just in case our domain wasn’t ready by then. So we extend an invitation to @brichis to discuss this if they are interested.
Conclusion
We’re happy to support this proposal, and we also want to discuss potentially passing it through our QuestBook Domain instead of through onchain governance.",20

On October 11th, we held our 13th governance call at SEED Latam in collaboration with L2 in Spanish, where we discussed how to allocate votes from the Short-term incentive program with our community.
Participants: 55 attendees
Duration: 1h 20m
Process
Given the nature of the vote and the large volume of proposals, as I have already mentioned, we formed a working group to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the proposals. The process was as follows:

We examined the initial 106 proposals, asking specific questions related to each protocol.
From those, we selected 32 proposals totaling 54,398,000 ARB.
The community had the opportunity to vote for the protocols on our Snapshot, aiming to reach the 50M ARB figure. If you wish to understand our process in depth, you can refer to here and here.
Based on the community voting results, we cast our vote on the Arbitrum snapshot in favor of the protocols that received the most support. Below, you will find a detailed list of these proposals.

Conclusion
The volume of proposals was substantial, and the time for evaluation was limited. Surely, as governance, we need to continue refining the process, but despite these challenges, achieving this fund allocation coordinated by ArbitrumDAO has been a success.
On our part, as SEED Latam, we acknowledge that our process was somewhat cumbersome and confusing but by no means arbitrary. We always include and educate the community when making decisions. We have learned from this experience and will continue to enhance our internal processes for the benefit of Arbitrum and our community.",23
13895,cattin,2023-11-01 20:15:04,"Proposal: Empowering Early Contributors: The Community Arbiter Proposal
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote in Favor of this proposal at the Temperature Check.
Rationale
We believe it is important to retroactively reward Arbitrers who collaborated in the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem in its early days. These early collaborations are important and beneficial to the ecosystem and should be recognised and compensated.
Consideration
We would like to clarify that this decision is subject to change for voting in Tally, as we would like the proposal to include the following details in the next phase:

List of the 25 members, with their discord user, Twitter (or other social media if possible) and the address where they will receive the funds
Criteria considered for the election of the members
Description of their contributions and tasks they performed. Link and metrics, we know this is difficult, but we believe there is surely data to collect.
Multisig address where funds and signatories will be received

Conclusions
We should keep in mind as DAO that this kind of proposal opens the door for other contributors to ask for retroactive payments for past contributions. Perhaps in the future, we should establish a general framework to be able to filter this type of proposal.",24
13895,cattin,2023-11-02 15:08:39,"Proposal: Build Optimal Onboarding for STIP Teams (BOOST)
The @SEEDLatam delegation, led by myself, has decided to vote AGAINST this proposal at the Temperature Check.
Rationale
We recognize the value of these projects in attracting new users to the ecosystem. However, we have decided to vote against for the following reasons:

We consider the requested amount of 1M to be excessive, especially when compared to RabbitHole’s proposal, which requests half that amount. Although we understand that they take a different approach.
The proposal is adjusted with the STIP execution date, taking into account that on-chain voting takes 2 weeks the schedule seems to be quite tight.
We would like more details on expenses to understand the amount of tokens requested.
We would also like more details of the missions to be executed and an estimate of the metrics you believe you can achieve.

Conclusions
We hope that the proposal will include more details and that the costs will be justified and detailed. As we mentioned at the beginning, we know that this type of project attracts new users and could be beneficial to the arbitrum ecosystem.",25
13895,cattin,2023-11-09 21:28:54,"Proposal: Activate ARB Staking
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote AGAINST this proposal at the Temperature Check.
Rationale
After reading the entire proposal and all the debate it has generated, we have decided to vote against it for the following reasons:

We believe that 12 months for an experimental proposal is too long. Perhaps it should be reduced to 6 or 3 months and iterated upon as some results are measured.
1% of the Circulating Supply is a high amount to offer as a stake incentive.
We agree with @Michigan_Blockchain that a minimum APR of 7.8% for users to accumulate the tokens passively will likely attract nearly all token holders. This will result in a loss of liquidity for $ARB across all exchanges and diminish its use as collateral in monetary markets. It is counterproductive to the goal of driving network and ecosystem growth as voted in the STIP incentives.
As @pedrob mentions, there should be some pre-established metrics that this proposal aims to achieve. We would also like to see metrics from other staking programs with different governance tokens, listing the pros and cons.
We also don’t think that adding staking to increase token inflation would add ‘utility’ to Arbitrum’s token.
There are several legal risks and complexities associated with a staking program, which may inadvertently transform ARB staking into an investment contract. It is important to distinguish between staking for the purpose of validating or securing a network and staking solely to receive a financial return.

Conclusions
We’re always down to explore new ways to add utility to Arbitrum’s token, but we simply don’t think that this proposal would achieve that goal. Plus, it needs more detail and a clearer definition of the objectives it seeks to achieve. Lastly, for an experimental proposal, the time and amount involved are quite significant. We also believe we can innovate with more than just staking the ARB token.",26
13895,cattin,2023-11-09 21:30:05,"[PROPOSAL] - Consolidate Security Proposals into a RFP Process
The @SEEDLatam delegation decided to vote:

AGAINST: Arbitrum Security Enhancement Fund
FOR: Consolidate Security Proposals into a RFP Process

Note: We want to clarify that while we were analyzing the proposal and preparing this message, the @Cyfrin team decided to withdraw it. However, we believe it is positive to leave our feedback.
Rationale
As with our past vote, we consider it essential to establish a general framework for contracting service providers, where everyone can compete on an equal footing. This will enable ArbitrumDAO to evaluate and choose the best option in terms of cost, capability, and quality. Therefore, we support the initiative proposed by @dk3, which reflects the approach that the DAO should adopt to prevent centralization and the monopoly of services, as @pedrob expresses in their post. Furthermore, this method ensures that any provider has the chance to compete, thereby improving both the variety and quality of available alternatives. It also makes ArbitrumDAO an appealing environment for the most competent teams in the ecosystem.
Conclusion
We consider the Consolidate Security Proposals into a RFP Proces approach to be beneficial to ArbitrumDAO. We believe it is necessary for the vendor selection process to include the participation of recognized experts in the field of security auditing, as this is a critical area that requires knowledge and experience in the field.
We look forward to a more detailed description of the selection process that is fair, democratic, and competitive for all applicants prior to the Tally vote.",27
13895,cattin,2023-11-09 21:30:52,"Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote AGAINST this proposal at the Temperature Check.
Rationale
We believe the proposal accurately identifies the needs of an emerging DAO that requires driving third-party proposals and providing assistance to delegates to make informed decisions.
The post begins by stating that the Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the research, coordination, design, and risk assessment necessary to move forward in an optimal manner.
Now, the question is, should it be the DAO’s responsibility to fund the research, coordination, or design of third-party proposals seeking Arbitrum funding? Shouldn’t it be its own responsibility to submit optimal proposals for approval? Who has an interest in having these proposals approved?
One could argue that the DAO does have an interest in financially supporting teams to deploy on its network, as this will create incentives for users to join the network, generating positive network effects that ultimately benefit the DAO and the value of the ARB token.
So what is the best way to achieve this?
First step: Establish a clear process or framework for projects to present their proposals. Even though there currently exists a template, we think it’s still to simple and might benefit from having some more details. Therefore, the first step should be to agree on a template or framework for those projects submitting proposals. This should include, at least:

Project Identification.
Team Overview (including previous successful works).
Milestones & Deliverables.
Supplementary Research.
Required Funding.
Commitment to transparency and accountability.
Disclosure of any conflict of interests.
Support Needed: Highlight any specific areas where the project requires pre-approval support or resources from The DAO.

Why? We agree that there may be cases where projects or just good ideas, as the Arbitrum Coalition proposal states, may not have the capacity to conduct the research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally on their own. And we are fine with projects asking for it.
How to financially support projects? This can be achieved in various ways:

Hire a governance facilitator to help them understand the processes and assist projects in preparing proposals.
Have the DAO contract a service provider to thoroughly study the proposals, recommend what is deemed advisable, and help the delegates decide.
Provide resources to the delegates so they can form their own teams and have the operational capacity to analyze the proposals. In this case, financially supporting only a certain percentage of the delegates will incentivize them to do their research and make more well-founded decisions. In this scenario, the ARB holders ultimately decide which delegates perform this task most efficiently, and, in theory, those will be the ones to receive a larger percentage of delegated ARB.

Hiring a Facilitator
We talked about this role some time ago but the DAO did not have the maturity and activity that it has today. This role encompasses what has been proposed here for The Advocate and makes it much more comprehensive, being key in assisting any participant in the governance of Arbitrum.
Hiring a Service Provider
The Arbitrum Coalition would act as a service provider. How can we ensure that this provider is neutral, does not favor particular projects, and does not conflict with the interests of the DAO?
One option is to bar this position to delegates or large ARB holders.
But this unfairly disadvantages the proponents, who have the reputation and track record to provide high-quality and efficient services to the DAO. Therefore, in line with what @dk3 said, we need to build trustless systems that don’t allow collusion or censorship. (we share the concerns described by him in his post)
What can be done? Utilize existing systems: Use the temperature check as a filter to decide which projects will receive the resources for the research, design, and risk assessment service provider to move forward optimally.
As it happens now, proposals that are approved via temperature checks are not necessarily complete or defined. Sometimes the approval comes from delegates supporting an idea or project, but with the condition that the proposal is strengthened.
This same system can be used for the DAO to express the intention that the project should receive assistance from the service provider. By this, before the on-chain vote delegates will have the necessary tools (research, risk assessment, etc.) to decide whether to approve that proposal or not.
Whom to hire as a service provider? As @pedrob argues in the Security Enhancement Fund proposal, the DAO could opt for approving a budget dedicated to subsidizing research and risk assessment, subsequently allowing each protocol to apply for the subsidy they deem necessary for deployment on Arbitrum. Complementing this, a list of recommended—or potentially mandatory—service providers could be voted on. This ensures that, when evaluating each application, the research and risk assessment are guaranteed to be conducted by a reputable and proficient service provider (such as Blockworks, Gauntlet, & Trail of Bits).
Providing resources to the delegates
Lastly, as we mentioned before, offering financial compensation will incentivize delegates to conduct their research and make decisions with a stronger foundation.
DAOs like MakerDAO incentivize their delegates with substantial resources, and their responsibilities extend beyond merely voting and communicating their vote—they also carry out sensitive tasks such as auditing spells and other activities related to governance security.
The expected tasks for the delegates could be specified, and a work regulation outlined that the facilitator will verify before executing payments.
Which do we believe is the best approach?
In our view, a resilient and decentralized system should feature a combination of the three strategies. A facilitator is contracted to support in the initial stage, the possibility of requesting funds prior to the final approval of the proposal, and providing delegates with greater resources so they can study the proposals in depth and with quality time.
Conclusion
We would like to thank Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits for the detailed proposal and, most importantly, for bringing this discussion to the table. We agree that the DAO should allocate resources to ensure that the proposals are well-supported and assist delegates in making informed decisions. In this case, we don’t agree with the proposed mechanism.
In this regard, we will support future proposals that include a detailed framework for how various service providers can present themselves to offer their services, rather than a specific allocation proposal for a single provider. There should also be specific milestones outlining the objectives to be pursued and KPIs that allow for the measurement of the results achieved.
Also, we agree with L2BEAT that the current delegate situation is not long-term sustainable.
We believe that a proposal of this nature, which aims to alleviate the workload of delegates and support them in their decision-making processes, should aim for a multi-faceted system. Resources should be allocated to a mixed solution where not just one concentrated point is incentivized, thereby mitigating all the risks and concerns detailed in this forum thread. To this end, we think it prudent to revisit the discussion about hiring a facilitator, the incentives for delegates, and ultimately, the framework for the contracting of service providers.",28
13895,cattin,2023-11-12 17:09:19,"Proposal to Backfund Successful STIP Proposals (Savvy DAO) [DRAFT]
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote FOR this proposal at the Temperature Check.
Rationale
According to the STIP proposal, only 50 million ARB was originally allocated to support various projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, this fund was quickly exhausted due to the large number of proposals received in the forum (a total of 106). Unfortunately, only the initial 20 projects that gained community approval were able to secure the incentives, leaving several other projects, that were also approved by the community, without any financial funding.
Given this situation and motivated by the insights provided in tnorm’s proposal, which highlights the DAO’s capability to unlock additional funds to backfund successful proposals, we believe the action suggested by this proposal is reasonable.
Conclusion
We support this proposal because we acknowledge that this whole process was a bit experimental and it only seems fair to support those projects that had already been approved by the DAO but couldn’t fit within the budget. Going forward though we do want to emphasize that this type of extension shouldn’t be used for future STIPs and we should formulate a solution to prevent this from happening again.",29
13895,cattin,2023-12-04 21:27:16,"Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Procurement Framework [Security Service Providers]
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote FOR this proposal at the Temperature Check.
Rationale
The proposal seeks to establish an RFP for selecting auditors or security service providers in the Arbitrum ecosystem. We believe this is an essential first step to ensure high-quality services for the DAO in a fair and competitive way.
This will not only contribute to improving the current and future security of the projects and the ecosystem in general but will also encourage the participation of the parties that are truly interested and create healthy competition between security service providers.
Conclusion
The objective of this Snapshot vote was to keep following the right path of the previous proposal where the Arbitrum DAO voted in favor of Consolidate the Arbitrum Security into an RFP Process

AIP: ArbOS Version 11
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote FOR this proposal at the Temperature Check.
Rationale
We believe that updating all Arbitrum chains with the EVM Shanghai update, along with the PUSH0 opcode, is a wise decision to bring Arbitrum closer to the technological infrastructure of Ethereum. This ensures that new developers using Ethereum will feel comfortable working in Arbitrum.
The Shanghai update later or soon will have an indirect impact not only on Arbitrum but all L2 solutions that use Ethereum as L1. So, we believe that it is crucial to consider all technical changes that Ethereum undergoes to guarantee that Arbitrum will remain at the forefront of technological advancements.
Conclusion
We support the idea of keeping Arbitrum updated with all the changes that Ethereum will undergo to improve its performance. This action will indirectly enhance the L2 chains that Arbitrum DAO handles.

[TALLY]Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote AGAINST this proposal at the Temperature Check.
Rationale
Upon reviewing the information provided after the snapshot vote, we concluded that it’s simply too difficult to determine if the contributors are being compensated justly for their contributions to the DAO. We’re not trying to minimize their effort or make it sound like they don’t deserve any compensation, but we think it would be reasonable to make this compensation proportional to their contributions or at least have a clearer idea of what these contributions were, which would be expected for the amount being requested.
Most of the information provided is challenging to validate completely. We believe that it can be presented more clearly to assist all delegates in supporting this proposal.
Conclusion
The support of all users to help grow the Arbitrum ecosystem is crucial for attracting new potential users. However, we believe that this kind of contribution requires a deeper explanation of the budget to maintain transparency.",30
13895,cattin,2024-01-23 07:17:17,"Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote FOR this proposal at the Temperature Check.
Rationale
The proposal aims to establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) with the objective of ensuring transparency, efficiency and a responsible approach to procurement. This initiative is aimed at benefiting the Arbitrum ecosystem by ensuring high quality service providers.
We strongly believe that the ADPC will create an optimal organizational framework for the procurement of services. At the same time, it will establish a marketplace for service providers that have undergone preventive quality assurance, contributing to the overall improvement of the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Conclusion
The creation of the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee is a crucial step to promote transparency, efficiency and accountability in procurement processes. By creating a structured framework and marketplace for pre-approved service providers, we anticipate significant improvements in the quality and reliability of services into the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote FOR this proposal at the Temperature Check.
Rationale
The Arbitrum Research and Development Collective (ARDC) is designed to help Arbitrum users refine and improve their ideas, transforming them into solid DAO proposals. We believe that this support will ensure the creation of high quality proposals, promoting a positive impact into the Arbitrum DAO. This initiative is especially beneficial for new users with innovative ideas but little experience in participating in a forum.
Conclusion
The creation of the Arbitrum Research and Development Collective represents an interesting idea to help users refine their ideas and turn them into high-impact proposals. To us this is crucial to the continued growth and success of the Arbitrum DAO.

Long Term Incentives Pilot Program
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote AGAINST this proposal at the Temperature Check.
Rationale
I want to say that I appreciate all the effort that went into drafting this proposal. I understand that the whole STIP was a bit chaotic, so I really like seeing a proposal that aims to make its successor more efficient, but I’m not sure if this is the best way.
First of all, I feel like relying so heavily on a council could end up centralizing Arbitrum’s governance a bit too much, especially if it’s related to protocol incentives since they are essential for the development of the ecosystem. Because, even though I understand that it was a burden for most delegates, I think that we could just give them more time to review proposals (with longer review windows and feedback periods). This, coupled with compensations for delegates, could alleviate the burden.
Replacing delegates with a council might be more efficient in a way, but it also takes away value from governance - if I’m not wrong, many protocols started engaging with the DAOs governance thanks to STIP.
Second, I think some expenses are a bit too high and might not be necessary. I understand that the DAO has a massive treasury but it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be a bit more careful with it ~ excluding the incentives, there’s an additional 815,000 ARB requested for various purposes, this amounts to roughly $1.7M. For example, I think that the program shouldn’t include the role of the advisor since, ideally, with a longer timeframe, feedback should come from the delegates + it would encourage protocols to learn the DAO governance process.  As a side note, I noticed that @SEEDGov applied to this role, but I just wanted to state that our delegation decides independently from the organization.
Conclusion
Eventhough I like the direction towards this proposal is going, I think we have to develop a program that seeks more involvement from the delegates and relies less on centralized committees.",31
13895,cattin,2024-02-07 03:02:41,"LTIPP Council + Advisor elections
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote for the following candidates to form the council for the Long-Term Incentives Pilot Program.
Pilot Program Advisor Elections

@JoJo: Has been acting as an allocator in the domain of ‘Ideas for new protocols’ for the Questbook platform. We believe their experience assisting various projects in applying for grants adds significant value to the council.
@Boardroom: They have considerable demonstrable experience in governance, their alignment with Arbitrum’s values is clear. They have shown credible neutrality in other governance and very good communication skills, which we consider important for this position.
Abstention: We did not vote for a third position because @SEEDGov was a candidate and it was a conflict of interest for this delegation.

Pilot Program Council Elections

@GFXlabs: We are familiar with the work of GFX Labs in other governances (Optimism, MakerDAO), we believe their experience is necessary for this first instance of the Council.
@karpatkey: We are also very familiar with karpatkey’s treasury management work in other DAOs, we believe they are the right profile for the council. They have demonstrated their knowledge in this excellent report on Arbitrum’s Treasury.
@Bob-Rossi: Has a general knowledge of the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystem. In addition, he is an active delegate and has demonstrated alignment with the values of Arbitrum. We believe this general vision can be an added value for the council.
@therollupco: They have great knowledge about the Defi ecosystem in Arbitrum and have also been active in giving visibility to the protocols that were selected in STIPv1.
@karelvuong: Their experience within and alignment with Arbitrum is very clear. We believe they are the only person who has knowledge and experience in web3 gaming. We believe it is important for them to be part of the council given their profile and the clear need within arbitrum to support this ecosystem.

We want to make it clear that although the @SEEDLatam delegation voted against the Long Term Incentives Pilot Program, for the reasons expressed here. We believe that as a delegation we must respect the will of the DAO, which approved the program, hence we have dedicated time to evaluate each applicant. While we may not always agree with some proposals, our main objective and responsibility is to contribute to the success of Arbitrum as we announced from the beginning in this governance.",32

The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote “Increase the threshold to 9/12” in this proposal at the Temperature Check
Rationale
As mentioned by other delegates at the RFC, increasing the minimum number of signatories from 7 to 9 is the least intrusive and easiest to reverse as it does not require on-chain changes.
On the other hand, considering that the Security Council is a crucial component of Arbitrum, we insist on creating some kind of Emergency Response Drills, which should be audited by a third party, to evaluate the efficiency of the council’s response times.
Broadly speaking, the idea is to define certain response parameters that the DAO expects to be satisfactorily met by the Security Council, including response time, and number of signatories, among other aspects.
Conclusion
After carefully reviewing the proposal and considering the comments from @dzack23, we believe that option 1 is the most appropriate.",33
13895,cattin,2024-02-16 15:41:14,"Election of Procurement Committee Members (ADPC)
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote for the following candidates to form the Procurement Committee

Joseph (@Immutablelawyer): First of all, we think he had done a great job in drawing up the proposal for the committee in question. In addition, it is necessary to consider that Joseph has an adequate background for the work to be done by the committee. His professional experience in crypto and his focus on service agreements make him a great candidate. Finally, he is also an active member of governance, having contributed value to other initiatives.
Bernard Schmid (@Bernard): His knowledge of governance processes and strategies, his experience in Arbitrum DAO and related initiatives, and his focus on transparency, accountability, and finance make him a strong candidate and provide some diversity to the committee.
Jeff G (@Jeff_G): Jeff has a strong procurement background having spent a long career in government. He has also focused on building relationships with security vendors in the crypto industry which reinforces his suitability for the role.

13895,cattin,2024-02-16 15:42:26,"Changes to the Constitution and the Security Council Election Process
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote FOR this proposal at the Temperature Check and Tally vote.
Rationale
We fully agree with the need to improve the Security Council election process and believe that this proposal goes in the right direction by putting all applicants on an equal footing and allowing for a more orderly process where there are first contenders’ submissions and then evaluation, rather than both processes being concomitant.
In addition, we suggest (as this is such an important vote) again to think about incorporating shielded voting and we are open to further evaluation of options to achieve this. We believe that this modality of voting avoids certain vices typical of public voting, such as being swayed by what others vote, benefiting those who gain support early in the vote, or speculating by delaying the vote until the end to decide the vote in the last minutes.
Conclusion
The proposal in question is a step forward in terms of voting structure, making it fairer and easier to carry out. It also introduces a necessary check on the wallets used by council members.",35
13895,cattin,2024-02-23 16:47:47,"Experimental Delegates Incentive System
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to ABSTAIN in this proposal at the Tally vote.
Rationale
Considering that we have proposed ourselves as the experimental system’s Administrators and although we think that delegates are the core base of the DAO and should be properly incentivized to maintain active participation, both in voting and feedback on proposals and in the ideation of governance processes, we believe that the right thing to do is to abstain from voting to avoid any possible conflict of interest.
[Non-Constitutional]: Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote FOR this proposal at the Temperature Check
Rationale
In principle, we believe it is valuable to introduce Arbitrum to the diversification of its treasury through investment in Real World Assets (RWA) while leveraging this goal to also incentivize the deployment of protocols on the network.
However, there are some points that we believe should be improved before moving forward with the proposal:

More clarity towards the goals of approving this budget. Is it to diversify the treasury? That seems too limited. Is it to experiment with RWA? Is it to incorporate as many providers as possible into Arbitrum?
More clarity towards the expected timeline. How much time should we expect until the screening committee publishes the RPF? How much time will they review applications? Once investments are done, how much time do you consider must be waited until STEP it’s considered successful? Or what milestone must be achieved to consider it concluded?
More clarity towards RFP and how to evaluate the committee’s work. If it’s not possible to have the definitive version of the RFP before the tally vote, it would be great to have some guidance points on how it will look like and what we can expect of their work.
A detailed breakdown of the budget. I expect to have a full breakdown on how the 200K ARB are going to be used for the implementation of the proposal.

Also, as @pedrob stated, it is necessary for us as a DAO to define short-medium-long term objectives, to have a consensus on what to spend on, and to make a framework for investments that aligns with the sentiment of the DAO itself.
We hope that through STEP 1 we can learn about how we want to manage treasury more broadly, so that we can implement a strategy for both spending and investing, considering the impact, cost/benefit, and sustainability of each decision.
Conclusion
We believe that, although the proposal is headed in the right direction, it still lacks clarity on some issues that we consider essential for approval.
We will again support the proposal on tally if these issues are clarified and included in the proposal.
ArbOS 20 “Atlas” - Arbitrum Support for Dencun + Batch Poster Improvements
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote FOR both proposals at the Temperature Check and Tally vote
Rationale
We are clearly in favor of the proposed changes and are excited to see the benefits this update can bring to the entire Arbitrum community.
Conclusion
We are confident in Offchain Labs’ ability to continue to improve the Arbitrum ecosystem and appreciate their commitment to publish the relevant audits before submitting the on-chain vote.
Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote FOR this proposal at the Temperature Check
Rationale
As said in the conclusion of our previous rationale regarding the first version of this proposal, the support of all users to help grow the Arbitrum ecosystem is crucial for attracting new potential users.
However, the first proposal lacked sufficient elements to evaluate the contributions made by the Arbiters, the ARB amount requested was somewhat high and there were no details on the payments made in the past by the foundation.
On this occasion, the proposal has been clearer, although somewhat chaotic, it has allowed the delegates to have a closer look at the work done and thus have more certainty about the impact generated.
At the same time, we have obtained reliable information on the payments made by the Foundation in the past and the amounts requested have dropped considerably.
Conclusion
In summary and as mentioned by @maxlomu, we believe that the total compensation achieved between the USDCs paid by the Foundation and the ARBs required from the DAO seems fair based on the contributions and time the Arbiters have made to this ecosystem.
Finally, we would like to state that we agree with @krst statement and we also suggest that the DAO should not consider such votes in the future unless there is a very strong reason to do so.
Funding for Into the Dungeons: Machinata - a PvP Digital Miniature Game V2
The @SEEDLatam delegation has decided to vote AGAINST this proposal at the Temperature Check
Rationale
Although we believe that both the gaming industry in general and this project have a lot of potential, some aspects do not allow us to support this proposal.
First of all, we understand that this is not the most desirable way to award/apply for grants. It is inefficient and complex both for the devs (who in case they have to apply individually in different proposals are forced to understand the flow of a proposal and the ins and outs of the DAO functioning) and for the delegates, who should consider and give feedback on each proposal separately. We therefore consider that we should avoid establishing such a precedent.
Secondly, and concerning the above, we would like to see this type of proposal within a developer grant framework where various actors in the industry can apply.
Conclusion
Although we find the proposal reasonable and promising, we consider that it is necessary to focus on having a comprehensive framework that allows us to better establish the processes to be followed as well as the objectives we pursue when investing in Gaming as a DAO.",36

Introduction
LBS Blockchain is a student and professional society at the London Business School (LBS) set up in 2021 to empower the next generation of LBS business leaders to pursue the fast-growing opportunities in web3. We focus on:

Education: Educating our peers on blockchain technology and new protocols in development in the ecosystem
Career Opportunities: Helping students place into roles in web3 and network within the wider web3 community
Entrepreneurship: Leveraging the entrepreneurial talent at LBS to originate capital and bring ventures to market
Governance: Participating as delegates in leading DAOs and incubating our own experiments in on-chain governance

The LBS Blockchain Society is currently the fastest growing and most active society at LBS, having gained over 700+ Telegram members and organising numerous events for our internal and wider London community. This includes hosting our flagship Blockchain Conference, where we invite 250+ students, alumni and industry leaders to participate in 3 days of panel sessions, workshops, hackathon events and more.
Delegate Statement (why you should delegate to us)
LBS is a globally top-ranked business school and hosts one of the most internationally diverse student bodies. Strategically located in London, LBS students are experts in wide ranging subject matters, from financial markets, to organisational theory, to data science and more. Given the diversity of cultural and professional backgrounds amongst the student cohort, LBS students are highly entrepreneurial by nature. In 2021, London Business School entrepreneurs raised a cumulative $4B of funding in 2021, while our alumni have founded over 560 companies so far, including unicorns such as HelloFresh, Feedzai, Wayflyer, Livspace, and many more.
Despite our short history, we have been delegates to MakerDAO from May 2022 to April 2023 (through the a16z Token Delegate Programme) and Aave since October 2022. As such, we have acquired governance expertise that we believe will assist with our decision-making on Arbitrum. We always commit to voting independently and impartially, and to open source our rationale through frequent updates to this thread. We intend for such transparency to help anchor our thinking and hold ourselves accountable to the Arbitrum community.
Given our presence in Europe and the potential for partnerships beyond the governance programme, we see a natural synergy here for the society to be further involved with the activities of the network. As stated above, one of our objectives is to act as a facilitator in connecting the talent in our community to industry. We do so by organising large-scale events, workshops, networking sessions and more, as well as by directly helping to place students into roles in industry. Given the need for talent in a growing ecosystem like Arbitrum’s, we see significant scope for synergies both in and beyond our role as delegates.
We commit to dedicate our time and resources to help accelerate Arbitrum’s development and growth. We commit also to leverage our global network, business knowledge, and entrepreneurial mindset, to drive value for Arbitrum token holders.
Conflicts of Interest
Members of our team are founders of projects with a presence in other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. We also hold personal portfolios of network tokens that give us financial exposure to the growth of these ecosystems.
That said, LBS Blockchain currently does not currently have any material conflicts of interest regarding Arbitrum. In particular, as a society, we do not hold any cryptocurrencies besides a minor stake in Ethereum for voting gas purposes, nor do we currently accept membership fees. We agree to keep the Arbitrum community updated should any future conflicts of interest arise.
Waiver of Liability
By delegating to LBS Blockchain, you acknowledge and agree that LBS Blockchain will participate on a best-efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to participation in the Arbitrum Protocol or this DAO.",1
19123,lbsblockchain,2023-11-12 14:01:59,"Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition
Vote: Against
Rationale: We support the initiative to professionalise DAO operations by involving professional contributors like BWR, Gauntlet and TOB. However, the proposed budget is overly expensive for the intended scope, and lacks sufficient cost breakdowns and measurable KPIs to justify its passage. Moreover, there is a potential hazard of centralisation in voting power as the Coalition would have 25% influence over the Security Council.
While we agree with the underlying goal of augmenting governance effectiveness, our support for establishing such a council hinges on a thorough budget reassessment, alongside a provision of more detailed financial breakdowns and specific KPIs. If this vote passes, we would like to see a revised proposal enumerating the reasoning behind these points. If it does not pass, we are keen to support it once revised.
Consolidate Security Proposals into a RFP Process
Vote: For
Rationale: The RFP process to onboard qualified security service providers ensures no single auditor can dominate the space. This preserves the decentralized ethos of the DAO and fosters a competitive yet collaborative environment where the security services are of better cost-effectiveness, higher quality, and more flexibility in response to the needs of the ecosystem.",2
19123,lbsblockchain,2023-11-13 12:59:29,"Proposal to Backfund Successful STIP Proposals
Vote: For
Rationale: We support this proposal to backfund projects from Round 1 of the STIP and ensure broad-based support for this cohort. We understand that the est. 21M cost for 26 approved projects constitutes c. 10% of budgeted spend for Q4 2023, and we see this as a good use of funds in terms of investing in growth, building out the ecosystem, and supporting smaller and more innovative projects to improve the diversity and resiliency of the ecosystem. That said, we would caution against future repeated use of backfunding as it may set the wrong precedent for overruling due process (incl. funding prospects for STIP Round 2).",3
19123,lbsblockchain,2023-11-18 13:21:14,"Proposal to Funding Gas Rebate and Trading Competition Program to Amplify Arbitrum’s Ecosystem Growth
Vote: Against
Rationale: We consider the funding request of 1.5M ARB is disproportionate in light of the current status and maturity of Rage Trade, particularly with V2 still being in beta. Moreover, incentivising trading on a single platform runs the risk of picking winners, which we see as bad DAO governance. We share other community member’s concerns regarding the long-term impact and sustainability of these types of  initiatives. Given these factors, we recommend against funding this proposal.
If Arbitrum DAO were to consider a similar proposal in the future, we would recommend tendering proposals from a broad selection of DEX protocols (i.e., not just Rage Trade) to ensure incentives are distributed broadly and fairly.",4

Vote: For
Rationale:
We support this procurement framework to onboard security-based providers. It strives to ensure that the security services provided are of high quality and are selected in a transparent and fair way. Compared to the previous RFP proposal, this finalized version adds more details on execution workflow and is more ready as a guideline.",6
19123,lbsblockchain,2024-02-17 13:31:29,"AIP: ArbOS Version 11
Vote: For",7
19123,lbsblockchain,2024-02-17 13:32:41,"Establish the ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective
Vote: No
Rationale:
While the ARDC proposal is in strategic alignment with ArbitrumDAO’s goals and promises to pool expertise for enhanced governance, security, and risk management, there are significant concerns that lead to the recommendation against funding. The six-month duration outlined for the organisation’s first mandate may be too short to observe significant changes or improvements within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This limited timeframe restricts the potential impact and measurable outcomes that the ARDC could achieve, thereby making the investment challenging to justify. Additionally, the proposal’s approach of electing a single DAO Advocate contradicts the decentralised ethos inherent to DAOs, potentially undermining the collective decision-making process. Moreover, the structure of predetermined costs for each role in the proposal raises issues regarding efficiency and cost-effectiveness. A competitive tender process, allowing applicants to specify service costs and scope of work, would ensure transparency, accountability, and that compensation aligns with the level of contribution and productivity. These factors lead to the conclusion that the proposal, as it stands, should not be funded.",8
19123,lbsblockchain,2024-02-17 13:34:47,"Timeline Extension for STIP and Backfund Grantees
Vote: YES
Rationale:
The proposal aligns with the principles of flexibility, fairness, and operational accommodation, ultimately contributing to the robustness and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Not adjusting hedgy streams is not ideal, as it prevents stopping streams in the event of a protocol not using ARB as intended. However, it is compromised from the fact that after January 26th, protocols will only have 1/7 of their streams left to distribute, will have already been following the rules for several weeks at that point, and it is expected that they won’t want to ruin their reputations by breaking the rules.",9
19123,lbsblockchain,2024-02-17 13:35:55,"Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates
Vote: YES, option 2
Rationale:
The proper incentive is crucial for motivating delegates to participate continuously in DAO governance. Although designing a perfect reward mechanism is nearly impossible, the current framework attempts to capture the nuances of evaluation. We believe it is worth trialing for six months. Furthermore, the automation provided by Karma enhances administrative efficiency, eases the burden on delegates to report their work monthly, and improves data transparency",10
19123,lbsblockchain,2024-02-17 13:37:08,"[Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee
Vote: YES
Rationale:
The ADPC is set to introduce a structured, transparent procurement process, crucial for the ecosystem’s sustainable development. Attracting individuals with domain-specific expertise will elevate the quality of service procurement, ensuring high standards within the ecosystem.
We recognize the community’s concerns about potential centralization and the right economic value of the compensation. These were adequately addressed in the discussion, and if necessary, appropriate adjustments can be expected.",11
19123,lbsblockchain,2024-02-17 13:38:38,"Long-Term Incentives Pilot Program
Vote: YES, Fund Program with 45,815,000
Rationale:
We believe that a long term incentive program is essential to support builders contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This pilot program, upgraded upon feedback from previous STIP, suggests a DAO-elected councils framework to screen out the proposal which we see as reasonable and feasible.",12
19123,lbsblockchain,2024-02-17 13:48:18,"Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal
Vote: Yes, Increase the threshold to 9/12
Rationale:
An increase in the threshold to 9/12 is the easiest way, and it can retain the flexibility of having a different threshold in the future. For the user protection, extending the exit period would be good but it is not necessary when the increase in the threshold is made, and it may cause the delay of finalization of proposals. Thus, we would like to vote for the option 1.
Changes to the Constitution and the Security Council Election Process
Vote: Yes
Rationale
The proposed changes, obviously, will improve the fairness of the application process in that applicants have adequate time to apply for the Security Council and avoid the unfair advantage to the nominees who are selected earlier. Also, ensuring that the candidates have the ability to produce necessary signed messages across various chains should be necessary.
For the issue of whether the shielded voting system should be introduced, the system would be good to get rid of an influence coming from earlier voters who have a large amount of voting power, but careful consideration is needed in terms of technological feasibility.
Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0
Vote: Yes
Rationale
We voted yes for the Arboter proposal 1.0. The reasons of the decision was: the allocation of 500,000 $ARB tokens to “Arbiters” in order to acknowledge and reward their contributions made during 2021-2023 is mutually beneficial to both contributors and Arbitrum ecosystem. We consider that recognising past contributions sends a positive signal for ecosystem contributors and encourages future continued growth of the Arbitrum community.
From the community discussion, we noted that Arbiters received 6500-7000 USDC as a compensation for the work on Discord and no clear record is preserved to prove that who made what contribution. In addition, it is also noted that there is a potential risk that the society cannot compensate to people outside Arbiters who made contributions at that time. But, from the fact that Arbiters worked much outside Discord, that the proposal plan to distribute $ARB equally with a reasonable amount, and that without the reward the team obviously contributed to Arbitrum cannot be appropriately rewarded, we should vote Yes for the proposal.
Funding for Into the Dungeons: Machinata - a PvP Digital Miniature Game V2
Vote: Against
Rationale
Funding an individual project without a general scheme should be avoided because we should not evaluate it individually but a series of actions to improve the Arbitrum community. In the proposal, we cannot see, by implementing the game, a quantitative target and justification that we can think the target can be achieved.
We acknowledged that such games would help Arbitrum community attract/engage new users, so expect a proposal of establishing a general framework of funding.",13

 Some Governance Discussions:
Proposal: [Non-Constitutional] Funding for Into the Dungeons: Machinata - a PvP Digital Miniature Game V2
Description:
The proposal is for funding “Into the Dungeons: Machinata,” a PvP digital miniature game by Forgotten Machine. The team seeks 60,000 $ARB initially, with a total ask of 180,000 $ARB, to be disbursed in three tranches based on milestone completions. The game features turn-based tactics with players using a 9 card deck to capture the opponent’s base. The funding will support various development stages, including branding, website creation, marketplace development, card creation, Unreal Engine prototype updates, smart contracts, and initial marketing. The team highlights their previous contributions to the Arbitrum ecosystem and proposes benefits to the DAO, including introducing a new digital miniature model to Web3 and offering a portion of the game’s supply to the Arbitrum community.
Status:
The proposal is currently available on Snapshot and with a very close vote, there are only a few hours left until February 15th for the final decision.
AIP: ArbOS 20 “Atlas” - Arbitrum Support for Dencun + Batch Poster Improvements
Description:
This AIP proposes a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including the capability to leverage EIP 4844 to post batches of L2 transactions as Blobs on L1 Ethereum at a cheaper price. The proposal also includes support for most of the changes included in Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade and 2 improvements to batch posting for Arbitrum One and Nova.
Status:
A Q&A session about this AIP was conducted by Offchain due to the level of difficulty presented.
The on-chain voting is available on Tally and will start on February 16th.

20915,Bob-Rossi,2024-01-29 01:15:46,"Abstract
This post looks to start a discussion regarding a possible Constitutional AIP that seeks to set a standardized guideline for non-security council elections ran by the DAO. The end goal is to get community input on how we can create a more consistent and fair election experience moving forward.
Motivation
Since inception, the DAO has held seven different Snapshot elections across three difference projects. Due to a lack of direction in the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, all three projects varied their Snapshot voting approach as noted below:
Arb voting 11111×172 8.55 KB
A basic standardized guideline for handling elections will be beneficial to the community. We are nearing the one-year anniversary of the DAO. Now is the perfect time to evaluate the elections held thus far and to think about how to handle elections in the future.
Rationale
The Arbitrum Community should strive to create an election process that is as fair as possible - ultimately the community wants to make sure in the event of an election the winner(s) represent the will of the voters. A consistent voting process is one of the keys to a fair election. It ensures all participants in the process can perform their duties to the best of their abilities, as well as helps prevent candidates from gaining an unfair advantage against each other. As the process stands today with no guidelines, the following issues can occur:
Issue #1:
Snapshot has multiple ‘Voting Types’, some of which are less effective than others.
Proposed Solution #1:
The DAO should provide a clear guideline on which voting type to use based on the number of winners to be elected. Due to the nature of Snapshot voting this should be broken into two categories:

In instances where only one candidate will win the election this would likely be done by either “Single Choice Voting”, “Weighted Voting”, or “Ranked Choice Voting”. Ranked Choice Voting would be recommended. This will prevent ‘wasted’ votes that can occur with the other two methods. Voters who chose the least popular candidates do not lose their votes, but instead can have their votes upcycled to remaining candidates until the 50% mark is reached. I have added a poll to this topic to get a community feel for which of the options for a single winner election would be most popular.



Ranked Choice Voting
Single Choice Voting
Weighted Voting
Abstain





0
voters





In instances where two or more candidates will win the election this would likely be done by the “Weighted Voting” method. The Weighted Voting will maintains consistency in our elections by mirroring how the Security Council elections are ran. Approval Voting does not have safeguards in place to prevent voters from choose more candidates then electable. This was seen in the LTIPP vote where some delegates had to have their vote manually removed since they chose more candidates than the council allowed for. Other voting methods will not allow for multiple winners to be chosen.

Issue #2
Elections ran without the “Shutter” feature allow for voters to see election results before the election is over. Without hiding results until completion, delegates are incentivized to delay and / or change their votes up to the final minutes of voting. This unfairly benefits candidates who gain early support, as delegate voting behavior may change based on who is winning at that moment and this can materially winner / loser results. It will also not give true indication of support for lesser candidates who then may not feel it’s viable to run for future positions.
Proposed Solution #2
Mandate all elections must be run with the “Shutter” feature if on Snapshot (or equivalent if we ever more to another platform)
Issue #3
Variability in the application window can lead to a substandard application process. Applicants may feel rushed to apply, or miss the window all together due to scheduling conflicts.
Proposed Solution #3
Mandate a minimum application window period to ensure all possible candidates have a fair chance to apply. This can be combined with a minimum applicant count to ensure elections of varying sizes have a diverse pool to choose from. A discussion should be had on what a viable minimum application window looks like. Some factors to consider are:


Length of Time: The period should be long enough to allow ample time to put together a quality application, but not so long it unnecessarily delays voting.


Minimum Applicant Count: If a proposal does not garner enough interest to have more applicants than winning spots, the question becomes if the proposal was properly crafted.


Flexibility: The design should keep in mind that all projects have varying goals and skill sets, as well as varying levels of urgency. Some flexibility should be built in with that in mind.


A possible application window could look as follows, where “N” stands for the number of candidates who can win the election.  Please note — this is an example formula to give starting point for discussion, other formulas / ideas are welcome. Language can be added to note that this is the minimum voting window period and if proposals wish to extend the timeline or require more applicants that is acceptable.

Week 1: The number of applicants needs to be greater than or equal to the larger of [N+2] or [Nx1.70] (Rounded Down). If after 1 week neither threshold has been met, the application window can be extended for another 7 days.
Week 2: The number of applicants needs to be greater than or equal to the larger of [N+2] or [Nx1.70] (Rounded Down). If after the second week neither threshold has been met, the election does not go to vote.

Some reasoning behind the above proposed formula… If enough interest is showing within a 7-day window to meet the minimum, it can be concluded that ample time has been given for applicants to apply and an election can more forward at that time. However, an extension period is offered to give proposers some flexibility if the initial minimum is not met, as history has shown extensions often result in additional qualified applicants. The extension period includes a reduction in the candidate criteria. The logic is that a total of 14 days should be more than enough for any possible applicant who missed the initial 7 day window to apply. The lowered threshold can be an acceptable tradeoff to give leniency to projects who are willing to extend their application window to gather additional candidates.
The formula is broken into a larger of A or B methodology due to the formula not working well with 1 or 2 winner elections. Once 3+ winners are met, you will see the formula has a fairly consistent “winning percent” (percentage of applicants who will be elected to council) regardless of size. In the initial 7-day window, most elections will see roughly 3/5ths of applicants going on to win. With the additional 7-day extension, roughly 4/5ths of applicants now can win. However, at no point is an election 100% guaranteed victory.

Specifications & Steps to Implement
If enough interest is shown, I will put together an AIP that aims to update the Arbitrum Constitution to include language that defines a basic guidance for all Non-Security Council elections held by the DAO. The goal is to strike a balance between creating a consistent election process while maintaining some flexibility for proposers to fine-tune voting to fit their specific needs. The discussion above was based on current Snapshot voting, but Constitutional language will be done in a way that is platform agnostic in the case we ever move away from Snapshot voting. At a high-level, the language will highlight the following items, although all is open to changes as the RFC process goes along.

Define which voting type must be used for the scenarios defined in Issue # / Solution #1 above
Mandate that the election results are not visible until after the election is over
Mandate the minimum application window for a proposal based on size

Timeline

RFC Period - 2 Weeks
Take Feedback and Draft a Snapshot Vote - 1 to 2 Weeks
Snapshot Vote - 1 Week
On Chain Vote, if passing Snapshot - 2 Weeks

Timeline may change as need arises. I will also note that the Constitution has additional Governance Document mandated procedures, but I’m not 100% sure if those apply in this scenario since this does not affect contract information. If needed, additional time will be needed for:

Phase 4 - L2 Waiting Period - 3 Days
Phase 5 - Initiate and Finalize an L2 to L1 Message
Phase 6 - L1 Waiting Period - 3 Days
Phase 7 - Implementation

Overall Cost to Implement
There will be no cost to the DAO to implement.
And on a final note, thank you so much to @JoJo for his help with theory-crafting this discussion topic!",1
20915,Pepperoni_Jo3,2024-01-31 19:11:48,"These comments and thoughts reflect my personal opinions on this proposal. Whilst I am a member of the Arbitrum Representative Council (ARC), they do not necessarily represent the overall views of the council or provide an indication of final voting decision.
Thank you for sharing this post, @Bob-Rossi. Your thoughts on this topic are greatly appreciated. As the DAO evolves, establishing clear guidelines regarding voting mechanisms is going to become increasingly important.
I’ve provided my perspective and recommended actions for each of the major issues listed. One material change could be to break down the proposed adjustments into individual snapshot votes rather than grouping them together as one holistic set of governance changes. This would allow the DAO to assess, deliberate and ultimately decide on each option independently.
Topic #1 - Voting Mechanism
In my mind there is a tradeoff to the introduction of a standardised voting system. A standardised system could DAO through greater clarity and consistency, but also reduces the autonomy of individual proposal writers to experiment with and select a voting mechanism they feel is most suited to the particular election they are undertaking.
For this reason, and to avoid the issues of “how do we decide how to decide” (a common pitfall when approving multi-option governance and voting changes) I would propose the following action.
Action:

Run a snapshot proposal where the DAO can provide it’s feedback on whether it would like a standardised approach for election (1) OR leave the election process up to the discretion of the individual proposal writer (2)
If the DAO is in favour of a standardised process (option 2), we can then run a follow up Snapshot detailing the different voting mechanisms the DAO could choose to select.

Regardless, learning from the LTIPP “self voting” issues, going forward I think it is important for proposals to clearly articulate their election mechanism prior to starting the election process.
Topic #2 - Shutter Voting
I am strongly in support of the introduction of the “Shutter” feature for the reasons articulated above. It would also have the added benefit of reducing the frequency of last minute tactical voting.
Actions

Run a Snapshot proposal to test the sentiment of the DAO for running elections in future as: “shutter” (1) “non-shutter” (2) or “let the proposal author decide” (3)

Topic #3 - Application Window & Minimum Application Count
I would support the DAO’s initiative to recommend guidelines regarding the optimal length of time for individuals to apply (1) and establish a minimum application count (2).
I’ll need to reflect further on the specific mechanism. If the problem statement is “seven days may not give high quality applications enough time to apply for council positions” , reaching the minimum application threshold within seven days may still leave high quality applications without insufficient time to apply. For that reason we could propose an increased application window of 10 days. This could be combined with a minimum application count (N+2) with the voting rolling over by an additional week if the minimum application count is not reached within the initial 10 day period.
Actions

Before taking further action I’d love their to be more decision on the Application Window timeline and Minimum Application count

Keen to see what further discussion to bring out, both for topic 3 and the broader proposal.",2
20915,JoJo,2024-02-01 12:12:08,"ehy chiming in cause as posted by @Bob-Rossi we had this discussion together and I helped him with some oversight on what was needed.
I think there is a merit in breaking down in snapshot point by point (assuming, snapshot can’t handle a case like this which seems like the case). Totally fine with that.
In general tho, topic 1, 2, 3 are all part in my opinion of the same basket of “good habits” on how the dao should vote. I would even dare to say, this discussion is complementary to the one currently live about self voting. So yes, let’s discuss. And eventually let’s make separate votes. But, let’s keep in mind the big picture: it’s all about make election smoother, fairier and more standardised.
That said

topic 1 (voting mechanism): there could be a different approach maybe. Something like: standard way of voting should be X. But, if a proposal writer thinks there should be another mechanism of voting, it should be well articulated in the proposal. We leave the liberty to move into something else, but also, we should be aware that it would be more of an exception than anything. This all stands on the fact that we hope proposers, and also commentators, will be mature enough to understand that 99 out of 100 respecting the rules is +ve for the dao
topic 2: nothing to add. It should be consistent. Again tho, would personally lean toward “shutter”, with exception possibilty as per the above if any.
topic 3: is a numerical question more than a mechanism one. Bob studied previous elections, in the end we need to guarantee that for every election there is at least a certain amount of people, more than the spots available. So, numbers are up for discussion.

20915,Bob-Rossi,2024-02-03 04:27:14,"Thank you @Pepperoni_Jo3 for responding and providing some thoughts.

One material change could be to break down the proposed adjustments into individual snapshot votes rather than grouping them together as one holistic set of governance changes. This would allow the DAO to assess, deliberate and ultimately decide on each option independently.

In my initial drafting of this, my goal was to discuss the voting process on the whole and getting to a standardized guideline. As I added issues to illustrate why I think the overhaul was needed, it has sort of morphed into these three key issues. I do believe all three are worth addressing at once for simplicity and effectiveness, but I also don’t want one controversial piece stop another popular item from passing. I’m no way opposed to splitting this up (and upon further reflection this may be the way to go anyway). Maybe the process looks like 3 Snapshot temp checks, where then the passing items go to Tally all as 1 item however.
I’ll add, there may be other best practices that can benefit the election process that I may not have addressed. So if other issues are present I have no issues expanding this out into a 4+ item discussion either.

For this reason, and to avoid the issues of “how do we decide how to decide” (a common pitfall when approving multi-option governance and voting changes) I would propose the following action.

Run a snapshot proposal where the DAO can provide it’s feedback on whether it would like a standardised approach for election (1) OR leave the election process up to the discretion of the individual proposal writer (2)

Regardless, learning from the LTIPP “self voting” issues, going forward I think it is important for proposals to clearly articulate their election mechanism prior to starting the election process.

I think this is fair and I like the idea, and to your point earlier there are a lot of variables between the issues that may need multiple temp-check elections. The more I think about it the more I think this may be the cleaner option.
A question back to you - I was struggling with this in terms of how to set a guideline without affecting flexibility proposal to proposal. However, I couldn’t really see a scenario where say 95% of elections would be perfect for Weighted Voting, but there then is a specific use-case that is for Single Choice. Or the same with say Weighed vs Approval in a 2+ winning candidate election. Do you have thoughts on what I may be missing? I am all for allowing flexibility for situations we can’t foresee, but I also don’t want to create openness just for the sake of it… as the balancing act with this is always going to be that if we loosen the rails too much it opens us back up to the gamification issue.
Maybe the play here is we define a specific voting type, but proposers can use a different voting type if and only if they clearly state that in the initial proposal discussion. Snaphot vote 1 is for the proposal, then in tandem a Snapshot vote 2 is up for approval for the ability to use a different voting method. That way delegates have a chance to block that voting style before the election occurs. I know it creates extra steps and I admittedly don’t like how ‘ugly’ that is, but I’d also rather have that option there in that edge use case where it really does make a difference… and in theory it would be only happening once in a blue moon anyway. Food for thought - @JoJo tagging you as I saw you had a similar thought about allowing proposal writers to ask for another mechanism. I would agree it really should be a ‘99 out of 100’ type thing.

I am strongly in support of the introduction of the “Shutter” feature for the reasons articulated above. It would also have the added benefit of reducing the frequency of last minute tactical voting.

From discussions had in the Security Council Election Thread as well, it seems this will be the least controversial item. To your point above I’d hate to see this specific item lost because one of the other issues can’t be agreed upon. FWIW, I think this is the both the easiest thing to fix and conveniently probably causing the biggest issues regarding gamification of votes.

I’ll need to reflect further on the specific mechanism. If the problem statement is “seven days may not give high quality applications enough time to apply for council positions” , reaching the minimum application threshold within seven days may still leave high quality applications without insufficient time to apply. For that reason we could propose an increased application window of 10 days. This could be combined with a minimum application count (N+2) with the voting rolling over by an additional week if the minimum application count is not reached within the initial 10 day period.

Thank you for adding your thoughts on this one, as this one I spend the most thinking time on. I don’t know if there really is a perfect answer here, so I too welcome anyone who is willing to input their thoughts into this. It’s all about flexibility while still setting a ‘floor’ of minimum viable action. I personally have no issues with 10 days instead of 7. Again this is probably where your point of breaking up the votes shines as we can propose a few popular methodologies.",4
20915,Pepperoni_Jo3,2024-02-09 12:46:59,"I think this an excellent idea!



 Bob-Rossi:

Maybe the process looks like 3 Snapshot temp checks, where then the passing items go to Tally all as 1 item.


Part of my rational for this approach is that if pushed to vote now, I would opt for:

FOR shutting voting (no brainer IMO)
AGAINST fixed voting mechanism (as I think some optional flexibility in any system is good)
ABSTAIN on Application Window and Application Count (though FOR on a 10 day application window increase)

Breaking it up feels important to me as if other delegates hold the same sentiment, it could lead to a rejection of shutter voting due to token holders disagreeing with a fixed voting mechanism.



 Bob-Rossi:

Maybe the play here is we define a specific voting type, but proposers can use a different voting type if and only if they clearly state that in the initial proposal discussion.


I support this proposal, but I suggest removing the parallel second snapshot vote. Doing so would establish the best practice for voting within the DAO, while still permitting others to adopt alternative voting mechanisms if explicitly stated in their proposals. This approach would resolve the issue of proposals initiating elections without clearly defining the election mechanism.",5

20915,Bob-Rossi,2024-02-11 15:15:54,"@pfedprog A few posts, so responding to all in one.

I am not sure that shutter voting is always good, i think voters will be colluding in other ways or means, for example, in private messaging and subsequently hold more power over non colluders

Can you expand on in what way shutter voting creates a new and specific negative action that otherwise wouldn’t exist in a non-shutter vote? Voters colluding in private messaging is independent of the shutter / non-shutter decision, so in my opinion it’s not fair to say shutter shouldn’t be implemented because it only solves 1 problem and not all of them.

So → Collusion will still be possible
Hence, i think we need to go back to the question of what exactly are we trying to solve here for.

For context, while I would love to stop collusion where possible, the goal of this RFC would be to create a more standard election process that should hopefully create a better experience for all parties involved. As well as take away some of the ‘gamification’ pitfalls that can occur from certain voting mechanisms. If there are ideas to stop collusion present I’d love to explore them, but unfortunately there isn’t really much that can be done to prevent delegates from establishing private channel discussions.

I think that the current feature benefits the promt response to the election
With shutter feature it will benefit mostly the decision makers → largest token holders / delegates
Should we allow for delegates collusion ?

Can you expand on this? Especially the shutter feature benefiting mostly the decision makers? I’m honestly confused where shutter benefits the largest token holders / delegates over non-shutter. And I’ll add I’m not sure what the shutter feature has to do with delegate collusion in this context.
A side question / clarification — for the Shutter feature the votes are hidden ONLY for window the voting is live. All votes would be publicly known, by delegate, once the election is complete. So delegates would still be held accountable at the end of the vote as their votes would be public knowledge. I wanted to check if you knew that was part of the shutter feature, or if you thought they were hidden permanently? As you had noted “Transparent and Timely voting” above, and wasn’t sure if you thought shutter would ruin the transparency aspect. As shutter still has public results posted by delegate, and voting still has to occur timely as shtuter does not affect the time the voting period is live.",12

In short, it amplifies the benefits from colluding between delegates with sufficient amount of votes to swing the results of the proposal.
With non shutter votes there is a bug / feature that a promt response to a given election might lead to a gamification. Sure. This promotes social media posting.
But with shutter voting we absolutely move the communication channels to private messaging and mafia style games.",14

21172,SEEDGov,2024-02-10 05:21:23,"Motivated by the completion of test #1 with the information from December 2023, we decided to conduct another test with the data provided by the delegates for January 2024.
Incentive compensation criteria
As stated in the proposal and in test#1, there are certain rules that must be followed in order to obtain compensation at the end of each month. These rules are as follows:
1. Voting Power Greater than 50,000 Voting ARB Tokens: According to the information collected from this dune, at the time of writing, there are a total of 186 delegates that meet this criteria.
2. Historical Tally Participation Greater than 25%: This value is taken directly from the tally, specifically from the profile of each delegate, only those with a participation greater than 25% will be considered as eligible. It is important to note that for the calculation of this parameter only participation in proposals that are not tests or those with the prefix “[OLD]” are taken into consideration.
3. Monthly Participation Greater than 60% (TP 60%): With the information provided by each delegate in the month, the monthly score or participation is calculated. Only those delegates with a score greater than 60% will be eligible.
4. Application Template: As mentioned in the proposal, all delegates who wish to participate in the program must fill out an application template which will be posted in a dedicated forum thread.

The confirmation template is as follows:

Forum Username (Link):
Twitter Profile (Link):
Snapshot Profile (Link):
Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):



5. Complete Foundation KYC: Once a delegate’s application has been confirmed , in order to receive any sort of compensation, it is necessary for delegates to complete a KYC process administered by the Arbitrum Foundation. Applicants should send an email requesting the foundation’s KYC process to compliance@arbitrum.foundation.
Test
With these criteria, we proceeded to manually load the data of all the delegates in a table. The following raw data  were obtained.
Test month
For the elaboration of this test we took as a sample the month of January 2024.
Proposals considered
Unlike test 1, in which all proposals initiated in December were taken into account, for this new test it was decided to take into consideration only the proposals that ended in January. These were:
Snapshot:

Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee
(Ended January 9)
Long-Term Incentives Pilot Program
(Ended January 16)
Pilot program Council Elections
(Ended January 23)
Pilot Program Advisor Elections
(Ended January 23)
Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal
(Ended January 25)
Election of Procurement Committee Members (ADPC)
(Ended January 30)

Tally:

[Updated] Proposal to Establish the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective
(Ended January 22)
[UPDATED] Experimental Delegates Incentive System
(Ended January 23)

Note:
The AIP: ArbOS Version 11 proposal will not be taken into account for the recount despite being one of the proposals finalized in January. The reason is that it was already taken into account in Test 1.
Table: JAN 24 (60% TP)
According to the criteria expressed above (TP 60%), in conjunction with the results of the calculations in the table, the delegates that would receive compensation would be as follows:
1600×607 306 KB

Bonus Points (BP)
Unlike the previous test, this time the bonus point was taken into consideration. There were several high impact contributions throughout the month which we collect in this document. Of all these individuals who contributed only 1 is a delegate (@krst), so he was assigned the corresponding bonus. You can find the evaluation rubric for these cases here.
BP Proposal:



Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal Proposals


    This proposal was co-authored by the L2BEAT governance and research teams. 
Abstract
This AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the “Stage 1” designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to “Stage 0” designation. 
Motivation
On December 7, L2BEAT published an update to the security council requirements for the Stages Framework. The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise. 
Ration…
  


Note: We were also going to consider this post from L2Beat for the bonus point, but the proposal was dropped.
Test Results
As in the previous test, despite the fact that the program is designed to give incentives to the TOP 50 thin people who meet all the criteria, for the month of January 2024 only 12 Delegates met enough attributes to obtain compensation. These can be viewed below:
778×371 46.1 KB
We would like to emphasize that the requirements are not exhaustive. Even if you are a delegate with a low Participation Rate (PR%) but with active participation during the month you can exceed 60% of the required PT.
Additionally, it is important to note that in order to reduce the workload, the table was filled by ignoring from the beginning those delegates who did not have the minimum of 25% participation in Tally. Since, as specified in the rules, it is imperative that this requirement be met.
In case there is any error in the data upload or any other concerns, we encourage the community to provide feedback to make this process as accurate as possible.
Considerations

As a source of truth we used Tally votes, Snapshots and delegate comments posted on the Forum. A collection was made where both the Communication Rationales and the comments considered to have a high impact on the debate and the proposal can be identified.
While we understand that delegates use other media to discuss, for the moment we will only use these media as a source of truth, in the future if the DAO wishes, new sources will be added.
For this test, only comments during the month of January were considered.
As in the previous test and as mentioned in the proposal @cattin should not be included in the accounting.

Additional data
With the data collected in the table we have a more specific picture of delegate participation in governance:

Only 186 delegates have more than 50k Voting Power.
Of the 186, only 66 exceeded 25% PR in Tally.
The expense that the DAO would assume for the month of December for delegate incentives alone would be 41954.16 ABR.
Any delegate with a 25% PR in tally, having participated in all the voting (tally and snapshots) and commented at least 50% of the proposals or issued only the rational, exceeds the 60% of TP that allows him/her (as long as he/she is within the 50) to access the incentives.

Final
In this second test we were able to try out new ideas to optimize the framework before it goes live in March. These new ideas helped us to see more of the true potential of the program. However, for this program to have the desired effect, the active participation of the forum delegates is necessary.
In this test the table was filled in manually, so there may be a human error factor, to address this we are actively working with Karma to automate the counting of certain parameters.
As in the previous test there was a low number of delegates who met all the requirements to be compensated.
Once the program starts, we are confident that there will be a greater dynamism in the DAO and a better organization when it comes to voting, commenting and communicating voting intentions.
We invite all delegates to apply for the program and fill in the template with all the information requested in this thread.
In case you have any questions, need help or think you can give feedback on how to improve the program, you can do so by posting in this thread.
We encourage delegates to participate and give their best effort to improve participation in the forum and the arbitrum ecosystem in general.",1

 Some Governance Discussions:
EAIP: ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas”
Description:
This proposes improvements to Arbitrum chains to leverage EIP 4844 to post batches of L2 transactions as Blobs on L1 Ethereum at a cheaper price, as well as support most of the changes included in Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade.
It is worth noting that ArbOS Version 20 is an upgrade that builds upon ArbOS Version 11 (which has been adopted by the ArbitrumDAO and will go live this week).
Status:
The proposal is currently in off-chain voting on Snapshot, available until February 9th.
AIP: Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix
Description:
This proposes improvements to batch posting for the Arbitrum One and Nova chains, including the introduction of a “batch poster manager” role with the ability to grant/revoke batch-posting affordances; and an increase to the max-time-variation “future blocks” and “future seconds” values to 64 and 768, respectively, in line with Ethereum’s proof of stake finality guarantees
These changes aim to make the system more resilient and do not represent a change to the system’s current trust model.
Status:
The proposal is currently in off-chain voting on Snapshot, available until February 12th.

TL;DR


The self-voting policy discussion aims to initiate an official forum discussion relating to the concept of self-voting so as to solicit delegate feedback re. whether we should aim to have a more streamlined approach to this phenomenon;


This self-voting policy discussion discusses cases that have arose in the past where delegates have self-abstained from voting with an aim to soliciting delegate feedback re. whether any of these potential scenarios (that may continue to arise from time to time), should have a more consistent approach to ensure harmonisation;


This discussion emanates from events that took place in the recent LTIPP elections and comments made by @SmolPhil in the election process itself. In light of the well-founded nature of these comments, we think it best to have an official forum discussion to agree on a way forward or rather, comparatively assess delegate-approaches towards self-voting.



Should this discussion lead to a general consensus re. when self-voting should be avoided, we are volunteering to create a Constitutional AIP to include this general consensus as a guidance of sorts in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution [Section 2].

ABSTRACT
This self-voting policy discussion aims to highlight the concerns surrounding self-voting within the ArbitrumDAO (hereinafter referred to as the ‘DAO’) and will apply to all voting activities i.e. Constitutional and Non-Constitutional AIPs. Its objective is to reduce ambiguity and facilitate more informed decision-making in subsequent proposals by creating a harmonised and consistent approach towards the self-voting phenomenon.
The self-voting policy discussion also addresses the challenges in determining what constitutes a ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ conflict of interest and whether this should or should not be included within the self-voting amendment to the constitution.
Anchored in the principles of ethical conduct and community trust, the self-voting policy discussion focuses on the necessity of instituting checks over balances, harnessing a shared understanding among all token holders.
MOTIVATION & RATIONALE
During the recent LTIPP proposal for Council Elections held on Snapshot there was some confusion as to whether ‘applicants may or may not vote for themselves’. This was raised by SmolPhil on the ‘LTI Pilot Program Position Application Thread’ on Jan 21, 2024.
Although this was not mentioned in the LTIPP proposal and does not form part of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution, there was an informal understanding that “the community found no self-voting rule to be the fairest approach”.
The purpose of this self-voting policy discussion is to clear the air and identify whether the community truly is in favour or against such a measure. Within both democracies and DAOs, it is integral that the ‘rules of the game’ are clear to all participants, making the voting process as transparent as possible.
Feedback in reply to this self-voting policy discussion on the community forum, in a public space accessible to all, is strongly encouraged.
OVERVIEW
Self-voting refers to the practice where token holders use their voting power to vote on proposals that involve or benefit themselves.
While self-voting could incentivise participation by aligning the interests of participants with the DAO, who ultimately have their ‘skin in the game’, it could also raise potential conflicts of interest whereby people vote in accordance with their self-interests rather than for the long-term well-being of the DAO.
The focus is to avoid situations of self-enrichment arising, in particular, where delegates vote for themselves to get elected to a committee, in which they will be privy to direct financial gain.
For the purpose of this self-voting policy discussion, ‘self-enrichment’ refers to the act of increasing or enhancing one’s own personal financial wealth as a result of one’s own voting contribution.
[POTENTIAL] STEPS TO IMPLEMENT: SELF-VOTING POLICY
There are myriad of modes of implementation re. The self-voting provisions that could potentially be included in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution.

Apply self-voting policy for election-type votes on an individual level.

Example: If X is a delegate, X cannot vote for him or herself if X is an election applicant.

Apply self-voting policy for election-type votes on an individual & committee level.

Example: If X is part of a delegate committee, the delegate committee would not be able to vote for X if X is an election applicant.

Apply self-voting policy in relation to conflicts of interest.

Example: If X is a delegate and has a vested interest in Y’s proposal or will be voting for Y’s proposal due to a direct affiliation (such as employment).

Apply self-voting policy in relation to self-enrichment.

Example: If X is a delegate, or part of a delegate committee, X & the delegate committee cannot vote on proposals which would lead to X getting a corresponding financial gain from the proposal passing.
POTENTIAL GUIDELINES FOR A SELF-VOTING POLICY
Identification of conflicts
A conflict of interest will be determined to arise where a token-holder or their close associates stand to directly (and possibly indirectly ~ depending on which proposal passes) to benefit from the outcome of a proposal.
Therefore, before voting, token holders must reflect on the proposal in question and whether a conflict of interest, as explained above, is present.
One of the main points of contention relates to indirect conflicts of interest. To explain what is meant by ‘indirect’ in this context, reference will be made to the example raised by SmolPhil (referenced above).
In essence, will Treasure DAO members be able to vote for SmolPhil, when applying to the LTIPP Council as an individual, given that he is a member of the ARC?
The purpose of this self-voting policy discussion is to open the floor to discussion and to act as a form of guidance going forward, rather than to argue for or against the inclusion of such a measure.
Disclosure Requirements
When voting for a proposal whereby an actual or potential conflict of interest may be present, one should self-identify this, including the nature and extent of the interest.
This should include an explanation of this actual or potential conflict, included as a reply to the proposal itself on the forum, which is to then be linked to on Snapshot or Tally, including the nature and extent of the interest.
Abstention Form Voting
In the event that there is a direct (and possibly indirect ~ depending on which proposal passes) conflict of interest, the token holder should abstain from voting and participating in the voting process regarding the proposal in question.
By leaving a comment on platforms such as Snapshot or Tally, further clarity is provided to the community as to the reason why the token holder has opted to abstain from the vote.
This practice helps address potential issues of uncertainty and information asymmetry. Therefore, the focus is on providing the most valuable information to voters in the quickest amount of time possible, thereby reducing the likelihood of voter fatigue.
Consulting with the Community
On the other hand, circumstances may arise where a token holder faces uncertainty regarding the existence of a conflict of interest.
In such instances, it is incumbent upon them to actively seek the community’s input on such matters, gathering their feedback and proceeding to act accordingly in good faith.
This aligns with the DAO’s aim to encourage a culture of open and structured dialogue without having to rely on small groups of people to make decisions.
Consequences for Violation?
The purpose and scope of this prospective proposal is to serve as a form of guidance. Consequently, for the time being, there are no plans to introduce formal enforcement mechanisms.
Rather, the primary deterrent against self-voting rests on the potential for reputational damage and community backlash, which could have far-reaching negative impacts surpassing any immediate benefits.
This approach is designed to uphold fairness and transparency within the DAO, rather than resorting to a rigid prescriptive approach.
LOOKING FORWARD
We encourage all ArbitrumDAO participants to voice their thoughts in relation to the subject-matter discussed above. For consistency’s sake, the end goal for this discussion is for it to result in a Constitutional AIP drafted in light of community feedback.",1
20886,pedrob,2024-01-26 20:13:56,"Hello, thank you for bringing this discussion to the forum.
I believe there should be no policies or prohibitions that limit the way delegates vote.
Delegates do not own their voting power; rather, they represent a collective of people who have chosen to entrust them with decision-making authority. Therefore, delegates should vote in the way they believe best represents those who have placed their trust in them. If self-voting is the best option for delegates, they should vote accordingly. Ultimately, it will be the holders who judge whether a delegate continues to deserve their trust based on the outcomes of the proposals.
The same logic applies to token holders. In plutocratic systems where voting power depends on the acquisition of transferable tokens with economic value, those who own such tokens should be able to vote freely for the outcome they deem most appropriate, even for themselves. In this case, their skin in the game and the impact of poor decision-making on the value of their holdings are at stake.
It’s important to note that policies that cannot be enforced on-chain have numerous ways to be bypassed if they are approved. It’s as simple as transferring the voting power to anonymous accounts and voting for the desired candidate, or nominating an anonymous person for the election to conceal the fact that one is voting for oneself.
Transparency is crucial. It’s important for everyone to be aware of the identities behind actions and decisions (without compromising personal privacy or engaging in doxxing). Knowing who is voting and for what reasons, without any restrictions, is essential. This approach fosters the development of reputation within the ecosystem. Ultimately, it’s the reputation, built on transparent and accountable actions, that should be the deciding factor in our system.
Now, I acknowledge that the system is imperfect, with the assumption that all delegates will act in the best interest of ARB holders or that the delegates have a clear and consistent understanding of the collective interests they represent.
With that in consideration, is there something that can be done to prevent undesired concentrations of voting power? Rather than directing how someone should vote, mechanisms or incentives could be established to encourage the distribution of power.
An alternative for the past elections for LTIPP positions could have been to set a high quorum as a minimum number of votes that a candidate had to obtain to be elected. This way, no candidate could have elected themselves solely on their merit, but they could have voted for themselves and validated their position with the votes of others.
This is just a rough idea that needs to be developed further. However, the point I want to make is that I believe the DAO should not direct or establish policies on how voting should be conducted, but rather should set up mechanisms and incentives to prevent concentrations that could hinder efficient decision-making.",2
20886,cp0x,2024-01-27 00:26:31,"Hello,
I also believe there should be no policies or prohibitions that limit the way delegates vote.
Firstly, any restrictions can be easily circumvented, or the delegation can be transferred to another address temporarily.
Secondly, there is nothing wrong if a person votes for himself, if it benefits the DAO.
If he wants to receive feedback, then it is his right not to vote for himself, but not his obligation.",3
20886,thechaingamer.eth,2024-01-27 20:55:33,Delegates do not own their voting power. Instead they are representatives of many community members. There should be no limitation on how delegates vote. They should be able to utilize their voting power in the best interest of those who have delegated to them.,4
20886,JoJo,2024-01-28 16:40:33,"have been discussing with @Immutablelawyer and also the rest of the DAO about this for a while.
I think not being able to vote for him/herself basically kills the whole political and democratic process: if I delegate to X it means that as a user I think that X will do my own interest. Accordingly, if X is a candidate, it would be quite natural for me to vote for X or to let X for him/herself.
Without going around the bush too much, this is an issue only for big voters. Big voters can change sometimes in a single vote a whole election.
I don’t think is necessarily bad, I think is part of the process. What could be instead a target would be for big voters (what big means, can be discussed, or conversely can be generalized to everybody) vote in a “responsible” way. And again what responsible means would have to be discussed. But in general

provide written feedback on the why of the voting. This is something that would be fantastic to do for everybody, but for sure big delegates should do it
vote in the right way. So, if there is a 3 out of 5 elections, in which the big voter is also a candidate, voting for himself plus another 2 options seems “righter” than only voting for himself. This also forces on choosing at least another 2 candidates that might not be a fit, but if in general we are targeting a multiple voting, better to vote than not
disclose, when voting, in the written motivations, if one of the people who got voted had previous relationship with the voter (ex member of the team, ex part time member, seed for example)
in general, disclose any conflict of interest (ie: I am voting for X, but we have a partnership and I am going to be a service provider for X for this thing).

In general would say that

voters should do what they want
voters should vote in a way that favours who they see fit (including themself) without hindering others (ie only voting for yourself but not for others in a multi election)
voters should disclose why they are voting in a certain way
voters should disclose whaterver info can help clarify their position in relationship to the entity being voted so that people are aware of it.

And btw part of the above can be partially solved through enforcing certain settings on snapshot, something on which @Bob-Rossi is working on.",5
20886,GFXlabs,2024-01-28 19:58:59,"One policy we’ve seen elsewhere that has worked well – particularly for elections like the one that just occurred – is that candidates may vote for themselves, provided they also vote for the maximum number of open seats or choices. If you were running for an advisor position for LTIP pilot, for example, you could vote for yourself but only if you also voted for two other candidates.
This allows a candidate to vote for themselves, but not be incentivized to withhold votes from all other candidates, which is the natural incentive otherwise.
It also prevents the disenfranchisement of delegators to that candidate.",6
20886,Pepperoni_Jo3,2024-01-31 19:46:22,"These comments and thoughts reflect my personal opinions on this proposal. Whilst I am a member of the Arbitrum Representative Council (ARC), they do not necessarily represent the overall views of the council.
As others have indicated I believe a preventing delegate self voting is philosophically and technically flawed.
Philosophical
Delegates are trusted to actively engage in voting in their communities and they should be empowered to support candidates who can effectively advocate for their delegate base. In many instances this may be the delegate themselves, or a member of their broader community. If self voting is prohibited, it would likely lead to large delegates abstaining from voting in many instances. This would hinder delegate’s ability to truly represent their delegate base’s interests and disconnect many token holders from Arbitrum’s governance process.
Technical
If self vote rules were implemented all elections would have to be manually audited to identify delegates and individuals who are self voting. This creates an operational overhead, and means final results produced through governance may not be adhered to and may require manually adjusted to address instances where delegates intentionally or mistakenly self voted. Even with active identification of delegates self voting, it may be infeasible to accurately identify all instances of self voting in a governance process. Moreover, the definition of “self voting” is still somewhat subjective, and fringe cases may need to be clarified by an adjudicator.
Rules around self voting make us less than decentralized and are less than ideal. Together I feel that this undermines the open, transparent and trustless approach to decision making DAO governance should provide.
Going forward…
I would be in support of non-binding (and non monitored) “delegate voting best practices” in a format similar to that suggested by GFX Labs:



 GFXlabs:

One policy we’ve seen elsewhere that has worked well – particularly for elections like the one that just occurred – is that candidates may vote for themselves, provided they also vote for the maximum number of open seats or choices. If you were running for an advisor position for LTIP pilot, for example, you could vote for yourself but only if you also voted for two other candidates.


We may also want to define further recommendations for delegate best practise for other voting mechanisms. For example the split vote mechanism used in the recent Procurement Committee election could have had delegates apply the following guidance:

Delegate can allocate no more than 50% of their vote to one of their own party.

It may be beneficial to tie this work in with @Bob-Rossi’s proposal on Standardised Guidelines for non security Council election.
These could be put forward to the DAO via snapshot votes for token holders to weigh in on with their perspective. I’ve provided my recommendations for non security Council election best practice adjustment here. Relating specifically to self voting, I’d recommend a rank order snapshot with the following options:

Delegates can’t self vote
Delegates can self vote, and are encouraged to vote aligned with best practice guidelines
Delegates can self vote and should not be encouraged to vote aligned best practise guidelines

These options might be a little wordy, but I’m hopefully targeted use of snapshot can help the DAO come to a clear decision on how to conduct elections going forward.",7

Unfortunately, at the moment providing a well explained reason for voting is one of the ways to actually get attention because its not a common practice but an exception to the rule.",8
20886,JoJo,2024-01-31 20:34:03,"I agree. But with the current incentive program for delegates, providing reasoning for voting should be, well, incentivised, right @cattin ?",9
20886,Jl_DefiEdge,2024-01-31 20:48:34,Great job to the folks who tackled the self-voting thing! Adding disclosure rules and the “no-vote” option makes things clearer. Pumped to see what the community brings to the table and how it spices up the DAO’s decision-making! ,10
20886,DisruptionJoe,2024-02-01 12:13:44,"I’d suggest that we keep the rules as close to what is enforceable onchain as is possible.
Unenforceable rules create situations where bad actors have an advantage over good actors. Said another way, when the only deterrent to cheating is your conscious - those without a conscious have an advantage.
We don’t want to create a governance system that systemically preferences corruption.
Delegates should be allowed to use their vote however they want to so long as it is possible to vote that way. If we really don’t want a certain type of voting, we should invest in upgrades to Tally, Snapshot, or the governor contract to ensure our governance resolves with math & cryptography rather than enforcement & policing.",11

We prefer this policy rather than no policy. We believe it’s doable to enforce on chain (or implementing a strategy to enforce them on Snapshot, possibly…)",13
20886,Griff,2024-02-02 00:14:20,"Honestly, I would prefer a no self voting policy… but it doesn’t seem reasonable without having someone policing it… so unless that is part of the proposal, I have to agree with @JoJo & @GFXlabs’s comments.
I especially want to double down on these suggestions from JoJo:



 JoJo:

 Arbitrum GovHack - ETHDenver
ArbitrumDAO is celebrating its ten-month anniversary and has experienced significant growth. Now, it’s time to take it to the next level during a three-day governance bootcamp and the Arbitrum community open day on February 26th and 28th at the Oxford Hotel in Denver.
Let’s lay the groundwork together and set up the ArbitrumDAO for success
Limited spots available, so sign up here.
 Governance News
 Election of Procurement Committee Members (ADPC)
The procurement committee of the Arbitrum DAO was selected through an off-chain vote on Snapshot, and now we know who will be leading this initiative, which is currently active on Tally and for now has received the approval of the DAO just a few days before the voting deadline.
The selected members are Joseph [Immutablelawyer], Paul Imseih, and Bernard Schmid [Areta].
If you would like to know more about the selected members, a pitching session was held on Monday, January 29, 2023, and you can watch the recording here.
 Changes to the Constitution and the Security Council Election Process
The discussion revolves around a proposed amendment to the ArbitrumDAO Constitution and the Security Council (SC) election process.
Aims to extend the election process from 42 to 49 days by adding a 7-day ‘Contender Submission’ stage before the ‘Nominee Selection’ stage. Candidates are required to sign a transaction from their EOA to apply for a Security Council position.
The Constitution will also be updated to correct wording mistakes and to reflect the new election process.
An off-chain proposal is now available on Snapshot and will be open until February 5th.
 Plurality Labs Milestone 2 Proposal Discussion
The ongoing discussion revolves around a proposal to fund Milestone 2 of the “Thank ARB by Plurality Labs” project, which aims to enhance value creation within the Arbitrum DAO. The proposal entails a significant funding increase, totaling $30 million in ARB on an annual basis, as compared to Milestone 1.
Feedback from main delegates has been shared on the forum, and as a result, a meeting will be held on Wednesday, January 31st at 11:30 am EST, where the community can ask open questions and analyze the proposal.

20944,SEEDGov,2024-01-30 02:30:42,"Following the recent approval of the delegate incentive proposal in tally, we did an initial test with the objective of showing the workflow at a high level and having an overview of the delegate participation status.
Incentive compensation criteria
As the proposal states, certain rules must be complied with in order to obtain compensation at the end of each month. These are as follows:
1. Voting Power Greater than 50,000 Voting ARB Tokens: According to the information collected from this dune, at the time of writing, there are a total of 175 delegates that meet this criteria.
2. Historical Tally Participation Greater than 25%: This value is taken directly from the tally, specifically from the profile of each delegate, only those with a participation greater than 25% will be considered as eligible. It is important to note that for the calculation of this parameter only participation in proposals that are not tests or those with the prefix “[OLD]” are taken into consideration, which are:

Core Test Proposal
Treasury test proposal
[OLD] AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency.
4 [OLD]Proposal to Establish the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective
[OLD] Experimental Delegates Incentive System

3. Monthly Participation Greater than 60% (TP +60%): With the information provided by each delegate in the month, the monthly score or participation is calculated. Only those delegates with a score greater than 60% will be eligible.
4. Application Template: As mentioned in the proposal, all delegates who wish to participate in the program must fill out an application template which will be posted in a dedicated forum thread.

The confirmation template is as follows:

Forum Username (Link):
Twitter Profile (Link):
Snapshot Profile (Link):
Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):



5. Complete Foundation KYC: Once a delegate’s application has been confirmed, in order to receive any sort of compensation, it is necessary for delegates to complete a KYC process administered by the Arbitrum Foundation. Applicants should send an email requesting the foundation’s KYC process to compliance@arbitrum.foundation.
Note:
It is important to note that in the event that there are more than 50 delegates who meet all the rules, only the 50 with the highest scores will be chosen to receive compensation. However, if there are fewer than 50 delegates who meet the criteria, only those who meet the criteria will be compensated.
Test
With these criteria, we proceeded to manually load the data of all the delegates in a table. The following raw data were obtained.
Test month
For the elaboration of this test we took as a sample the month of December 2023. The study was carried out separately for each month in question.
Proposals considered
For the elaboration of the table we took into account the proposals initiated in December, both in Snapshot and Tally, which were:
Snapshot:

Timeline Extension for STIP and Backfund Grantees

(Started on December 2)


Proposal: Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates

(Started on December 7)


Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective

(Started on December 11)



Tally:

AIP: ArbOS Version 11

(Started on December 21 and ended on January 8, 2024 as well as included in the December accounting)



Summary of table parameters

Activity Weight (%): Total activity of the delegate in the month.

Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%: Historical participation in the Tally.
Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%: Participation in Snapshot voting for the month.
Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%: Participation in Tally voting for the month.
Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%: Communication of voting rationale in the forum or communication thread for the month.
Commenting on Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%: High-impact comments or contributions to the debate in the month.
Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation): Bonus, awarded to those delegates who make significant contributions in the month.


Total Participation (TP): Total participation of the delegate in the month.

Note:
For this case study, the Bonus Point (BP) bonus will not be considered for the month’s participation calculations.
Table 1: DEC 2023 (+60% participation)
According to the criteria expressed above (TP +60%), in addition to the results of the calculations in the table, the delegates that would receive compensation would be the following:
1383×638 62.5 KB
Click here to see the complete table.
As you can see, even though the proposal seeks to give incentives to the TOP 50 of delegates who meet all the criteria, for the month of December, only 11 delegates had enough attributes to obtain compensation.
In fact, there were only 21 delegates who reached the 60% TP value, these separated themselves from the rest by actively voting on most of the proposals and communicating their voting reasoning in the forum, as well as commenting their opinions and contributing to the debate of the proposals in the forum.
517×544 12.4 KB
As can be seen the requirements to be met were not exhaustive. Even if you are a delegate with a low Participation Rate but with an active participation during the month you can exceed 60% of the required PT.
In case there is any error in the data upload or any other concern, we encourage the community to give feedback to make this process as accurate as possible.
Considerations


As a source of truth we use Tally votes, Snapshots and delegate comments posted on the Forum (here we made a complete collection of every comment significant to the debate or that will add value to the proposal). While we understand that delegates use other means to debate for the moment we will only use these means as a source of truth. In the future if the DAO wishes we will add new sources - but we believe that we should encourage delegates to have more discussions on the forum instead of private group chats that are not transparent and inaccessible to the public.


Some comments from delegates collected during the month of December were published one or two weeks after the voting ended, although it is not specified in the proposal, the idea of the program is that delegates comment and expose their rationale within the period in which the proposal is in voting.


As mentioned in the proposal @cattin should not be included in the accounting.


Additional data
With the data collected in the table we have a more specific picture of delegate participation in governance:


Only 174 delegates have more than 50k Voting Power.


If the requested TP had been 30% only 49 delegates would’ve qualified for this program instead of 69.


If the requested TP had been 30% they would have received incentives 49 delegates.



The expense that the DAO would assume for the month of December for delegate incentives alone would be 66715 ABR.


Any delegate with a 25% PR in tally, having participated in all the voting (tally and snapshots) and commented at least 50% of the proposals or issued only the rational, exceeds the 60% of TP that allows him/her (as long as he/she is within the 50) to access the incentives.

Final Considerations (Invitation to Delegates)
At the end of the day, we share a fundamental goal: to drive the continued progress of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Therefore, it is important to actively support high-impact initiatives emerging within Arbitrum to achieve this collective purpose.
To ensure that the performance of this framework has a significant impact in the upcoming months, the active participation of delegates becomes crucial. They are the vital actors that give shape and meaning to the dynamics of the DAO and the forum in general.
Their active involvement not only strengthens the community, but also enhances the chances of success and progress for all.
We encourage everyone to join this program and are confident that your participation will make a difference in Arbitrum’s future.
Conclusion
Just like any other experimental program, it is important to test in order to determine the weak points to strengthen them in order to obtain a well-structured framework, this is also useful to get first feedback and then implement them in Karma.
We understand that the low participation in the forum reflects how overwhelming governance can be at times. Also, once the incentive program starts, we believe that the overall motivation of the forum will increase, leading to higher participation - this does not mean however that any type of comment will be counted towards the delegates’ final score, since those trying to spam the forum for points will be swiftly eliminated from the program.
This is the first test, as a team we would like to mention that we plan to present another test of the framework with delegate data for the month of January 2024, which is currently under construction.
We encourage delegates to participate and give their best effort in order to improve participation in the forum and the arbitrum ecosystem in general.",1

Motivation:

I believe Arbitrum DAO is very serious about the its Governance Process and involving community in making key decisions as evidently by the amount of work has go into this document (Arbitrum Governance Process)
I’m a co-founder of Syncvote. I believe our tool can add tangible value to the implementation of Arbitrum DAO’s governance process without any changes to the current setup. The goal is to let admins and members focus on making decisions instead of getting lost in tech stuff.

Problem Now:

I see 3 existing problems in implementing Arbitrum DAO governance process:


The proposer must remember all the technical details of the governance process to avoid making mistakes.


The proposer has to bounce around different platforms, such as Arbitrum, for each step of the process.


Any solution that could potentially consolidate everything into one platform for consistency and ease of navigation would require the DAO to abandon its current setup and adopt a new one.


How We Solve It:


Syncvote is a chrome extension that can provide a unified front-end for any DAO member that wants to make a proposal to Arbitrum DAO. It acts like a central hub, no more bouncing between different platforms. Members can kick off and handle proposals, watch progress, and move through stages – all in one interface.
Why Syncvote will fit nicely into the current Arbitrum DAO practice:


Non-invasive, there isn’t any new platform to familiarize with, just open the extension and click “start new proposal” to start.


The extension works with all the platforms DAO has been using, so you don’t need to make any changes to your current setup.


It’s free, our goal is to eventually put every DAO to operate completely on-chain, so until Arbitrum DAO decides to write data on-chain; it won’t cost you anything.


My co-founder’s created this video to illustrate how the plugin works for a DAO: Syncvote Demo

Next Steps to Implement:

To implement this transformative solution for Arbitrum DAO, we propose the following steps:

After the proposal has been passed, I will convert the Arbitrum DAO Governance Process into a format compatible with Syncvote. An administrator/coreteam member can help me to follow-up and also check its accuracy.
After that, Arbitrum DAO will start announcing to community members on forum, announcement channels on discord and twitter Arbitrum that they can start using Syncvote extension to make new proposals from then on.

In conclusion, I see this as a straightforward implementation that helps to smooth governance experience for Arbitrum DAO community members. I would be grateful if Arbitrum DAO adopts Syncvote.
Thank you for reading my post. I would like to have your feedback on this topic.
Godwin.",1
20264,godwin,2024-01-09 03:14:20,"Hello mates,
I would love to have some of your comments on the topic. The proposal aims to make the governance process be something easy for every community member to take part in.
Do you think the governance process now is easy enough for everyone to cast a vote or raise a voice?",2
20264,duokongcrypto,2024-01-09 03:51:26,"Thank you for providing a detailed overview of Syncvote’s potential value to the Arbitrum DAO governance process. Your tool seems to offer a promising solution, making governance more seamless and alleviating the burdens on proposers and community members.
Among the challenges you highlighted, there are indeed many common issues in governance processes, such as the intricacies of technical details and the inconvenience of platform switching. Syncvote, as a non-intrusive tool, can provide DAO members with a consistent and user-friendly interface without altering the current settings, which is highly anticipated.
Your concise and clear explanation of Syncvote, along with the outlined plans for subsequent implementation steps, is impressive. Once Syncvote becomes a part of the Arbitrum DAO practice, we believe that community members will participate more effortlessly in the governance process, focusing more on decision-making rather than technical details.
We look forward to seeing this transformative solution in action.",3
20264,godwin,2024-01-21 02:31:12,"Thank @duokongcrypto for the feedback and showing your supports on my proposals,
I do think that Aribitrum DAO involves alot of activities and requires a lot of works. That’s why making things simple for users would be the top priority to think of. Syncvote goes directly to that point.
We’re also developing automated tools in Syncvote, that could help DAO even more.",4

Summary

We propose Arbitrum foundation launch Arbitrum grants program with a budget of $1M spread across 2 quarters to fund a wide variety of teams building apps on top of Arbitrum in a transparent manner. Questbook is leading Compound  grants program through delegated domain capital allocation model, a community-run grants program
We additionally propose that this budget be managed by 4 individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community. These domain allocators would manage grants for a domain. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which  Arbitrum wants to disburse grants
The performance of each of these domain allocators will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Arbitrum community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each domain allocator.

We (Questbook.xyz) will help facilitate setting up these domain allocators and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave


Motivation
As we continue to experience the depth of the bear market, it is increasingly important for Arbitrum to retain the mindshare of key ecosystem contributors and incentivize builders to build on top of it. Grants program is a great way to attract high-quality builders and grow the ecosystem more quickly. This proposal details the benefit to all the stakeholders involved - token holders, builders and DAO members.

Benefits to Arbitrum
Giving the selected domain allocators the capital and decision-making powers can increase the efficiency of the grants program, without compromising on accountability:

Individual expertise instead of collective blindspots
Distributed load instead of committee backlogs
Accountability instead of diffusion of responsibility

The proposed structure will lead to the following outcomes:


Aligned allocation of funds: By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, Arbitrum foundation can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (selected by the Arbitrum community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with Arbitrum’s goal of enabling the distribution of grants and empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Arbitrum.

Increased transparency: The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook’s reporting features will allow Arbitrum to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.

Increased accountability: With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.

Lower Turnaround Time (TAT): The Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model will help improve proposals’ turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem. An example of this is Compound who’s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours. The performance of domain allocators will be measured using objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure goals are achieved efficiently and effectively.

High Brand Recognition :  The Delegated Domain Allocator model will play a crucial role in boosting developer engagement with Arbitrum, as well as forming strategic partnerships with important ecosystems to jointly fund grants in mutually beneficial areas.


Specification & Implementation

The program structure focuses on having community members as domain allocators. Arbitrum foundation **will be required to set a budget of $1M to be disbursed by 4 domain allocators and for committee compensation. Each domain allocator will be elected by the community. Interested community members can self-nominate themselves to be considered for becoming a domain allocator. The domain allocator for each domain will be selected via a community-wide Snapshot vote. Domain allocators will run their domain on-chain for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community in order to evaluate the domain allocator’s performance.

image (4)2000×1110 149 KB

The disbursement of the grant will take place on-chain from a multi-sig wallet for each domain controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocators will approve or reject proposals based on their evaluation. The program manager will then coordinate with the Arbitrum team and the community to ensure that the proposal is aligned with Arbitrum’s roadmap before making the disbursal. The sole purpose of the multi-sig is to make sure capital is not being siphoned. However, the allocators are encouraged to make independent decisions in consultation with the Arbitrum team regarding the approval of the proposal based on their expertise.
The grants committee and the Arbitrum community shall evaluate the performance of each domain and domain allocator using publicly available data. The outcomes could be as follows:

Change the domain
Change the allocator/program manager
Change the budget

Active community members can also initiate a no-confidence motion to initiate a review off-cycle. This can be initiated by one of the active delegates on Snapshot. The program manager can coordinate this, if the situation arises, along with the active community members. The unused funds from every domain will be returned to the treasury at the end of the quarter.

Screenshot 2023-03-31 at 2.22.19 PM2392×1150 159 KB

The program will consist of

A Program Manager
4 Domain Allocators

A Grants SAFE, with 4/6 multi-sig, between the program manager and 4 domain allocators will be setup. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator.
The funds for the grants program will flow from the treasury into the Grants SAFE. This SAFE will hold the funds related to the grants budget and committee compensation. Funds that will be disbursed to the proposers will reside in the domain-level SAFEs. The program manager will be responsible to update the community about approved proposals and their details through bi-weekly community calls and reports over discord.
We have identified the following domains based on our research and the feedback from the Arbitrum team and community. We invite delegates and community members to self nominate themselves.




Domain
Credentials Needed
Why it is relevant




Gaming
Experience in game development or a deep understanding of Web3 gaming industry.
This will help Arbitrum  encourage more developers to create innovative gaming experiences and thus onboard new users to its ecosystem


Developer Tooling on NOVA
Core contributor to Arbitrum and popular L2s in Web 3
This will help Arbitrum build essential infrastructure, tooling for Arbitrum Nova


New Protocol Ideas

This will encourage more contributors to propose and run experiments for improving the Arbitrum protocol


Education, Community growth and events
Experience in builder community growth and technical bootcamps
This will help Arbitrum attract quality builders through community growth activities such as education courses, bootcamps, hackathons and sponsoring events




Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:
The following will be the roles and responsibilities of the selected domain allocators.

Time commitment per week: Maximum of 15 hours per week for the program manager and 10 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager will ensure that the workload is evenly distributed

We are inviting applications for the domain allocator role for all the domains mentioned above. All interested community members and delegates can apply in the comments section of this post.


Conclusion


What does success look like?



Objective

The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Arbitrum’s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.
Increase in the number of builders, proposals, and funded projects
Number of partners who are co-funding grants alongside Arbitrum in mutually beneficial areas
Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs)
Increase in the community members’ participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)
Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains during Abritrum’s community call
Increased engagement in builder community’s

Discourse
Discord, Telegram
Social media (Twitter, Reddit)
GitHub





Subjective

Improved community involvement in the grants program
Strengthened builders’ sentiment towards Abrbitrum
Enhanced Abritrum’s brand recognition in builder circles




KPIs

Each domain allocator is required to work alongside program manager and come up with domain-specific rubrics similar to the following in order to evaluate the proposals. If the identified rubrics are not in line with the domain or Arbitrum’s roadmap, anyone from the community can openly suggest changes or question them on the forum

On the one hand, I think this is a great proposal which deserves to be considered.
On the other hand, the purpose of the JokeDAO contest is to push the community to consider a pluralistic funding model. I do worry that if this were to be accepted prior to the many other framework proposals, the community might push back against the pluralistic design.
Overall, I would love to see this as one of the ones that get funded, but not considered THE grants program.",2

14081,jacksanyoda,2023-05-03 19:29:04,"(Opinions are my own)
Generally, I’m in favor of the delegated domain allocation structure for a grants program as it maintains the DAO’s authority while ensuring efficiency. In regards to its application to Arbitrum, I’m open to a trial run for with a $1M budget, scaling only if effective. I appreciate Questbook’s effort in this proposal, but I can’t support it in its current form. Here are the changes I’d like to see:


Two-phase voting: Proposal approval and Domain Allocator (DA) selection should be separate votes.

Reward community feedback on grants: As outlined in the product screen section, I like the idea of community voting on proposals to guide DAs. Although it’s not required for awarding the grants, nor does the DA have to follow the feedback, it’s a useful indicator for DAs. If technologically feasible to track (would need to check with the guestbooks team), I suggest allocating a small percentage (e.g. 1%) of the overall budget to reward members of the Arbitrum community that provide feedback on grant applications.

Questbook compensation: The current proposal gives Questbook a 5% fee on total allocated grants, which is acceptable as a platform fee. However, after talking to the Questbooks team, we realized this proposal would establish an agent of guestbooks as the program manager (PM) for the first 6 months as well. This will essentially creates a scenario where Questbook earns nearly 10% of the overall allocation of the budget (45k for PM and 40k for Questbook’s fee). This creates a conflict of interest and sets a bad precedent. While I appreciate the value of having an experienced PM set up the systems and procedures, I suggest a change to address this double-dipping issue. Options include reducing the agent’s tenure (to 3 months) and/or taking the agent’s salary from Questbook’s fee while they serve as the program manager. I’m open to other suggestions as well.

I’d love to hear others’ feedback on these points.",4
14081,Saurabh,2023-05-11 05:11:04,"Hey Jack, Thanks for the kind words and appreciate your support


This is going to be a two-phase voting process. Initially, we wanted the DAs to nominate themselves under this post and then have a snapshot where the community can choose the domain allocators. However, after speaking to the delegates and considering community feedback, once the proposal passes, we will create a separate post where both the community and delegates can nominate themselves for the DA role. Once the nomination period is over, it will go to voting. You can refer to the Arbitrum delegate post .


Thanks for acknowledging this it’s one of features of the product. As mentioned in the proposal. The domain allocators will approve or reject proposals based on their evaluation and the domain allocators are encouraged to make independent decisions in consultation with the Arbitrum team regarding the approval of the proposal based on their expertise.


Thank you for providing detailed calculations🙏. The 5% that we are asking for is to cover the operational costs of the tool. We would be open to reducing the product disbursal fees to 3% and having Questbook operate as a program manager for 6 months. We believe this would be a win-win for both parties and allow us to continue providing value to Arbitrum community and developers. Please let us know your thoughts on this proposal and if you have any other suggestions or concerns. Thank you for your time and consideration.


We will be posting again on the forum with the new changes mentioned above once the new grant template is live on the discourse.",5

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.

These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reinbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors. A full reinbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will obviously be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionaly, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which although is also part of the wider ethereum ecosystem it could be considered a conflict of interest. Currently, I am being allocated ~ 1k OP. In addition to this, ParaSwap has also been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme recipients, and if necessary, the representative of ParaSwap could be a different DAO member if this is considered a major conflict of interest. Personally, I believe that the growth of any decentralised rollup on the Ethereum ecosystem is a net positive for everyone in the space, and I will do my best to lend my knowledge in bettering the entire space ",6

It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

I am not the biggest fan of liquidity mining, at least not directly from a DAO; I think that in the best of many cases the best is to apply to different protocols that kind of incentives, maybe like Optimism that brought diverse uses to its network incentivizing it in an indirect way in usability and ecosystem.

Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO, if a small group centralizes power, the name DAO is only an aggregate.
Something that can help is to predefine in the beginning the creation of committees and delimit the members it should have at the expense of increasing diversity against personal interests.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is a bad reference to the DAOs, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree, but I feel that the committees or delegates fulfill that vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize the governance processes.

A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and also take into account their survival, therefore it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, by literally draining their funds I do not think they can pay.
That’s why I think the best thing to do, and depending on the case like FEI, is to return money to those affected, maybe under a vesting system or the DAO can get down to work to look after the interests of its users.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
The proposal would need to be considerate of the value driven vs the allocation. If the funding requested was only $50,000 to reach thousands of developers, or attract attention from university undergrads and clubs to drive innovation, then it would be worth because the control isnt relevant if the amounts reasonably low if the amount was higher than 2/7 would seem better and allow at most 1/3 for any position, if the purpose was to be Uniswap managed. DAOs need to be able to refer their control to other parties to operate efficiently so would depend on how many from the 3/7 were also Uniswap dels.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Hierarchy can be used to allow for oversight while allowing for autonomy in control for say having a committee to manage funding for projects, which controlled by the elected managers for the DAO who themselves are managed through the UniSwap or other token for a protocol.

Full reimbursement should be pref where able without killing the protocol. This should only be done in cases where the core protocol was directly involved so for say, a core part for Arbitrum like the DAO and say oracles run by the DAO get compromised causing other projects to be affected, yes compensate, but if a project thats large on Arbitrum were to be hacked, then no.

Добыча ликвидности - это популярная стратегия, используемая DAO для стимулирования поставщиков ликвидности и вознаграждения членов сообщества за вклад в платформу. Агрессивность добычи ликвидности может зависеть от целей DAO и толерантности к риску. Более агрессивный подход к добыче ликвидности может привести к более быстрому росту, но он также может увеличить волатильность и риск.
Предыдущие вопросы, поднятые в других общинах, могут сильно различаться, но некоторые общие включают в себя опасения по поводу прозрачности, управления и безопасности. DAO могут решить эти проблемы путем внедрения прозрачных процессов принятия решений, надежных протоколов безопасности и структур управления, управляемых сообществом.
В целом, цели DAO и подход к добыче ликвидности должны быть согласованы с потребностями и приоритетами его сообщества. DAO могут извлечь выгоду из включения обратной связи и вклада членов сообщества для обеспечения того, чтобы их стратегии и цели отражали ценности и интересы более широкой экосистемы.

Для
Больше ничего
Компромисс между централизацией власти и способностью выполнять задачи является общей проблемой для любой организации, включая DAO. С одной стороны, централизация полномочий может обеспечить четкое руководство и принятие решений, что приведет к более быстрому исполнению и более эффективному использованию ресурсов.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

3.The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a common challenge for any organization, including DAOs. On one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear leadership and decision-making, leading to faster execution and more efficient use of resources. On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision-making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of the wider community.",28

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

I have a keen interest in Public Goods Funding, DeFi development, and Tools for gathering data. Regarding liquidity incentives, I think incentives should be use for introduce new platforms to newcomers while also imposing limits on bigger capitals. I believe that the ArbitrumDao should use incentives to promote awareness of Arbitrum-based dApps, and as a result, capital will naturally move in.
Regarding the sample issue, I vote against it. Instead, I suggest improving the proposal by adding solid milestones to the process and transferring an initial amount to Flipside after each milestone is achieved, followed by subsequent portions. This way, we can strike a balance between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done.

My focus will be on bringing as many tools in a permissionless and decentralized way, for as many as possible for financial access.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview
Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.
Prompts to Answer:
How would you vote?
For
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
The proposal would need to be considerate of the value driven vs the allocation. If the funding requested was only $50,000 to reach thousands of developers, or attract attention from university undergrads and clubs to drive innovation, then it would be worth because the control isnt relevant if the amounts reasonably low if the amount was higher than 2/7 would seem better and allow at most 1/3 for any position, if the purpose was to be Uniswap managed. DAOs need to be able to refer their control to other parties to operate efficiently so would depend on how many from the 3/7 were also Uniswap dels.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Hierarchy can be used to allow for oversight while allowing for autonomy in control for say having a committee to manage funding for projects, which controlled by the elected managers for the DAO who themselves are managed through the UniSwap or other token for a protocol.

Full Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
Full reimbursement should be pref where able without killing the protocol. This should only be done in cases where the core protocol was directly involved so for say, a core part for Arbitrum like the DAO and say oracles run by the DAO get compromised causing other projects to be affected, yes compensate, but if a project thats large on Arbitrum were to be hacked, then no.
Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Diversity of opinions is critical to making progress and determining the future direction of the
Arbitrum ecosystem. We recognize and celebrate the fact that delegates will have diverse views and we both encourage and anticipate good-faith debates in the governance process. That being said, it’s critical that all featured delegates are operating with Arbitrum’s best interest in mind, so please affirm that you don’t have any conflicts of interest that would prevent you from using your best judgement to operate in the best interests of advancing the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Other than my own personal projects there are no conflicts as do not hold any other L2 assets beyond small drops. Am purely here to get Crypto to be used and am network neutral. And while not an ARB maxi, will give a more neutral reasoning for the space rather than maxing the ecosystem at the expense of the space.

Добыча ликвидности - это популярная стратегия, используемая DAO для стимулирования поставщиков ликвидности и вознаграждения членов сообщества за вклад в платформу. Агрессивность добычи ликвидности может зависеть от целей DAO и толерантности к риску. Более агрессивный подход к добыче ликвидности может привести к более быстрому росту, но он также может увеличить волатильность и риск.
Предыдущие вопросы, поднятые в других общинах, могут сильно различаться, но некоторые общие включают в себя опасения по поводу прозрачности, управления и безопасности. DAO могут решить эти проблемы путем внедрения прозрачных процессов принятия решений, надежных протоколов безопасности и структур управления, управляемых сообществом.
В целом, цели DAO и подход к добыче ликвидности должны быть согласованы с потребностями и приоритетами его сообщества. DAO могут извлечь выгоду из включения обратной связи и вклада членов сообщества для обеспечения того, чтобы их стратегии и цели отражали ценности и интересы более широкой экосистемы.
Для
Больше ничего
Компромисс между централизацией власти и способностью выполнять задачи является общей проблемой для любой организации, включая DAO. С одной стороны, централизация полномочий может обеспечить четкое руководство и принятие решений, что приведет к более быстрому исполнению и более эффективному использованию ресурсов. С другой стороны, слишком большая централизация может задушить инновации, ограничить участие и привести к принятию решений, которые не отражают потребности и приоритеты более широкого сообщества.

In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

to increase community involvement and decision-making power, promote decentralization, and enhance the overall functioning and success of the project.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
However, in general, it is important to consider the balance between centralization and efficiency when making decisions. While centralization can enable faster decision-making, it can also lead to power imbalances and decreased community participation. Therefore, any amendments to the proposal should prioritize increasing transparency and community involvement while still allowing for efficient implementation.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
It would depend on the specific circumstances of the hack and the impact on the affected parties. In general, it is important to balance the needs of the affected parties with the overall health and sustainability of the project. Full reimbursement may not always be feasible or sustainable, but partial reimbursement or other forms of compensation may be appropriate in certain cases. Ultimately, any decision should be made with transparency and community input to ensure fairness and accountability.

Regarding the overall goals of the DAO, it depends on the DAO’s specific objectives and priorities. Still, generally speaking, the primary goal of a DAO is to enable decentralized decision-making and collective ownership, where members can participate in decision-making processes and have a say in how the DAO operates.
Regarding liquidity mining, the aggressiveness of the strategy will depend on the DAO’s resources, objectives, and risk tolerance. Liquidity mining can be an effective way to incentivize users to provide liquidity to the DAO’s pools, but it also carries risks, such as impermanent loss and volatility.
Regarding the voting issue, if I were a member of the DAO, I would consider the potential risks and benefits of the proposal and vote accordingly. If I believed that the proposal would benefit the DAO and its users, I would vote for it. Still, if I had concerns about the centralization of power and the favoring of one service provider over others, I would vote against it or propose amendments to address these concerns.
Regarding amendments to the proposal, I would suggest reducing the amount of control given to Flipside and increasing the involvement of other analytics service providers. For example, instead of having Flipside control the allocation committee, the DAO could establish a more decentralized approach that involves multiple service providers.
Regarding the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, it’s essential to find a balance that ensures effective decision-making without compromising the DAO’s decentralized structure. One approach is to distribute decision-making power among multiple stakeholders and establish clear guidelines and processes for decision-making. Additionally, transparency and accountability are crucial to ensure that all members have a say in how the DAO operates.",54

DeFi development on Arbitrum
NFT development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.

I am not the biggest fan of liquidity mining, at least not directly from a DAO; I think that in the best of many cases the best is to apply to different protocols that kind of incentives, maybe like Optimism that brought diverse uses to its network incentivizing it in an indirect way in usability and ecosystem.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO, if a small group centralizes power, the name DAO is only an aggregate.
Something that can help is to predefine in the beginning the creation of committees and delimit the members it should have at the expense of increasing diversity against personal interests.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is a bad reference to the DAOs, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree, but I feel that the committees or delegates fulfill that vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize the governance processes.
Sample Voting Issue 2:

Split Reimbursement

A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and also take into account their survival, therefore it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, by literally draining their funds I do not think they can pay.
That’s why I think the best thing to do, and depending on the case like FEI, is to return money to those affected, maybe under a vesting system or the DAO can get down to work to look after the interests of its users.

I think there should be liquidity mining incentives for dexes and bridges, but no so much that it’s endless downwards  pressure on the treasury. The goal of the DAO should be to enable decentralization and keep  the protocol free from one group’s influence.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:


How would you vote?
Against


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would propose making the board more equal so that not one protocol had too much influence or control.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I would advocate for a set group of folks to execute, but have the decision of what gets done made by the group. I also think building in infrastructure to keep certain aspects of the blockchain from being influenced by a small team is a good principle to have.

Issue Overview:

FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

DeFI development on Arbitrum.
The DAO should be focused on incubating the most exciting projects in DeFi that desire the safety of Ethereum, the community of builders on Arbitrum, and the scalability that the network provides. At JonesDAO, I worked across the community to forge relationships building complex strategies that could ONLY happen here due to the speed, execution and partnership opportunities available. The DAO should focus on bridging these communities but also working with Hedge Funds, VC firms and more to ensure that Arbitrum is THE launchpad for capital in Web3.
Sample Voting Issue 1:


For


I would propose that each bounty is voted on with a snapshot as well as hard caps on each bounty equal to the 1 year expected ROI of the proposed net gain in LP fees vs bounty with payment in locked tokens that vest.


For such a well capitalized org as Uniswap, its important that things which can add layers of bureaucracy are mitigated to only those that require democratic thought and for business development activities a reasonable assumption that dollar values not exceeding expected return should achieve community response positively. It’s important to frame the choices to the community as ones which will have been discussed and debated internally so that only positive outcomes are shown outward.


Sample Voting Issue 2:

Full Reimbursement

As someone who was impacted - I can tell you that part of the frustration the community faced was when the founder of FEI had agreed then reneged on his promise to reimburse. Bear in mind that the Tribe inclusion of Rari was contentious in the first place and many thought the deal should have never been done.
With that said, when a protocol has a major hack, it becomes nearly impossible to operate without a reimbursement of said hack to the fullest extent possible. It’s tricky because this entire situation calls into question what Tribe was to Rari and whether it should have acted as a holding company or not. I believe that once Rari holders were assumed into Tribe, it became their obligation to fully reimburse and do the right thing by the community.

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a digital organization that operates based on smart contracts and runs on a blockchain. Its members can make decisions and manage the organization’s assets through a consensus mechanism.

The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is an important consideration in any organization, including a DAO. On the one hand, a centralized authority can make decisions quickly and efficiently, but it can also lead to potential abuses of power and lack of transparency. On the other hand, a decentralized approach can lead to more transparency and democratic decision-making, but it may also lead to slower decision-making processes and inefficiencies.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through rewards. Although the program scheme and funding were fine, the proposal was controversial because it gave Flipside cryptocurrency too much control over the distribution of UNI for rewards and oversight of the entire program.
For example, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the distribution committee and 1/3 on the oversight committee. There was also concern because none of the other analytics providers participated in the proposal.
This proposal flew by unnoticed, but it got very hot at 11 o’clock. A large number of university clubs supported the proposal because they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke out because of the centralization of power and support for one provider.
Invites you to answer:
How would you vote?
Against
What amendments, if any, would you make to the proposal?
A distribution so significant for one Flipside should not be possible. My suggestions: use the veto power in the allocation committee to create conditions under which the distribution of awards will not be manipulated for its own purposes.
How would you approach the trade-off between centralization of power and the ability to get things done?
Use of the veto on the committee
Reimbursement for the FEI RARI hack: in April 2022, Rari was hacked for 80 million, a vote was held to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022, another vote was taken to reimburse the cost of the hacked Rari, this time it was not passed.
Suggests a response:
What would you decide to do in this situation, other than flip votes?
I.e. should the parties be compensated for the exploit or not?
Separate reimbursement.
Reimbursement is the right thing to do when there is an error in sharing the risk of liability for the funds. It may be possible to consider deposit insurance for amounts according to prearranged valuation criteria.

The goal of the DAO is to give ARB holders the power to vote on key decisions governing Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova – networks that allow users to transact on the Ethereum blockchain with greater speeds and lower fees.
How aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
I personally don’t think that liquidity mining is any good in this case. I think it’s a little too risky and will create a lot of volatility.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

I believe that DAO should prioritize the security and sustainability of the platform.
Make sure it’s truly decentralized and not governed by a smaller entity.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

On one side a range variety of individuals can collectively come together from around the world to act as a single entity but on the other it often takes longer for decisions to be made as there are more voting participants. I think there should be a balance between the two but never give all the power to the smaller governing entity.

My two areas of interest are as follows: -
(a) Improving Governance participation
(b) IRL Arbitrum community gatherings
My stance on overall goals for DAO:
I think a DAO should have decentralization as its core tenet. We have started in the right direction by distributing tokens to the users who have contributed to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. DAO represents a new paradigm in organizational structure, one that is decentralized, transparent, and community-driven. We should never lose focus on our community. AMAs and IRL get togethers are a good way to achieve that.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - Against
2 - Nothing more to add
3 - I think this is a big challenge that every DAO has to face. In present scenario
accounts who are first or have money are able to dominate the voting. I think in a
council comprising of respectable members of the community may able to solve
this issue.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - No Reimbursement.
We know that defi is a dark forest and “Code is Law” is sword with two edges. Reimbursement sets a wrong precedent, it takes money to run a big organisation and we cannot reimburse every protocol that gets hacked onchain.

I am strong on community-driven decision making and sustainability.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Prompts to Answer:
How would you vote?
I will vote against the proposal as it appears to give too much control to a single service provider. The proposal could result in centralization of power and favoritism towards Flipside, which could potentially harm the overall decentralized nature of the Uniswap platform.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
A revision of the allocation committee and oversight committee to have a more balanced distribution of power among service providers. Also, a clause could be added to the proposal, stipulating that if Flipside fails to meet certain performance metrics, its position could be reviewed, and other analytics service providers could be considered for the role.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The potential concentration of power could lead to centralization, which may not align with the overall principles of the Uniswap platform. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that any decisions made are in line with the principles of decentralization and sustainability.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
I will support Full Reimbursement: I believe users should not be punished for something that was out of their control. If a hack or exploit occurred due to a vulnerability in the system, users should not be held responsible for the loss of their assets.

I believe that the goal of DAO is to establish a strong culture and set of beliefs. DAO serves as a spiritual and cultural symbol for people, representing their choices for the future. Additionally, DAO offers transparency and democracy that traditional organizations lack. All DAO members are equal, with the right to voice their opinions and submit proposals to contribute their ideas.
In summary, DAO represents a new cultural paradigm and carrier that can significantly change the way people develop.
Sample 1:
I will vote against.
To reduce control, it is necessary to decrease Flipside’s seats on the allocation committee. Additionally, the proposal would benefit from the inclusion of more analytical service providers.
This question requires a case-by-case analysis. In general, we need a certain amount of power to mobilize resources as we move forward. To prevent power abuse, we can set thresholds for relevant stakeholders to unlock corresponding power according to their needs. After each stage is completed, the organization should retrieve the corresponding power in a timely manner.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
NFT development on Arbitrum

My stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I believe the DAO should strike a balance between aggressive and conservative approaches in liquidity mining. We should be aggressive enough to attract more users and projects to the ecosystem while ensuring that the incentives are sustainable and long-term focused. The primary goal of the DAO should be to foster a thriving ecosystem on Arbitrum by supporting the development of innovative DeFi and NFT projects, promoting decentralization, and engaging the community in effective governance.
My stance on issues raised previously, in other communities:

High gas fees and network congestion: I support the development and integration of Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, which help mitigate these issues by providing lower transaction costs and faster processing times. Further improvements can be made by optimizing smart contracts and exploring additional scaling technologies.
Governance token distribution: I believe that a fair and transparent token distribution model is crucial to ensure the long-term success and decentralization of the DAO. The distribution should consider factors such as community contribution, project support, and long-term commitment.
Security and exploits: The DAO should prioritize the security of the ecosystem by actively funding and supporting regular audits, bug bounties, and collaborating with security researchers to ensure the safety of all projects built on Arbitrum.
Centralization risks: It’s important to actively work on reducing centralization risks by encouraging the development of open-source, community-driven projects and tools, as well as promoting a decentralized governance structure.
Intellectual property rights: The DAO should promote responsible NFT creation and trading by educating users about intellectual property rights and supporting projects that enforce these rights in a fair and transparent manner.
Environmental impact: The community should be proactive in supporting research and development of energy-efficient solutions to reduce the environmental impact of blockchain technology, such as adopting proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms or exploring more eco-friendly Layer 2 solutions.

Sample Voting Issue 1
How would I vote?

Against

What amendments would I make to the proposal, if any?

Reduce Flipside’s control over the allocation and oversight committees. A more equitable distribution of seats should be pursued, with representation from multiple analytics service providers and community members. This would help prevent centralization and favoritism towards a single service provider.
Include other analytics service providers like Dune Analytics in the proposal, promoting collaboration, transparency, and a more balanced approach to the program.
Establish clear guidelines and criteria for allocating UNI to bounties, ensuring that the process is transparent and objective, without any undue influence from specific stakeholders.

How would I approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Striking the right balance between centralization and decentralization is crucial for the long-term success of the DAO. While centralized decision-making can help expedite processes, it can also lead to single points of failure, bias, and lack of transparency.
To approach this tradeoff, I would advocate for the following:

Implement a multi-signature approval system for critical decisions, involving a diverse group of stakeholders.
Encourage community involvement in the decision-making process through open forums, discussions, and voting.
Establish a rotating committee structure, where members from different backgrounds and expertise can contribute to various aspects of the DAO.

This way, we can maintain a balance between efficient decision-making and decentralized authority, promoting a more resilient and transparent ecosystem.",88

Area of Interest: DeFi development on Arbitrum and Tooling
In my opinion, the DAO should have a balanced approach to liquidity mining, where the rewards incentivize participation but don’t compromise the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. I believe the DAO’s goal should be to foster a healthy and inclusive community that encourages innovation and experimentation while ensuring security and transparency.
Regarding the previous issues, in Sample Voting Issue 1, I would vote against the proposal as it gives too much control to one service provider. If I were to make amendments, I would suggest involving other analytics service providers in the proposal and reducing the number of seats for Flipside on the allocation and oversight committees.
Regarding the tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, I would suggest finding a middle ground where decision-making is decentralized, but there are clear guidelines and protocols in place.
In Sample Voting Issue 2, I believe parties affected by the exploit should receive full reimbursement. However, there should be a clear process in place to prevent future exploits and address any concerns about security.
I speak and write fluently in English and have a basic understanding of Spanish. I don’t have any conflicts of interest that would prevent me from using my best judgment to operate in the best interests of advancing the Arbitrum ecosystem.",90

Areas of interest:

Public goods funding
DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralized development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security-focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encourage the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question, we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem and the careful balancing act that follows each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community-owned, they need to have oversight over what the protocol will develop into. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist the short-term growth and user acquisition of the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidized too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.

These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course, there are endless possibilities for what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.

Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that anything that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will be biased. The positive side of this participation however is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralization of liquidity in the roll-up by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionally, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which although is also part of the wider ethereum ecosystem it could be considered a conflict of interest. Currently, I am being allocated ~ 1k OP. In addition to this, ParaSwap has also been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme, and if necessary, the representative of ParaSwap could be a different DAO member if this is considered a major conflict of interest. I believe that the growth of any decentralized rollup on the Ethereum ecosystem is a net positive for everyone in the space, and I will do my best to lend my knowledge to bettering the entire space",91

Prioritize transparency and communication with the community. This would involve providing regular updates on the progress of the reimbursement process and explaining the reasoning behind any decisions made.
It is also important to consider the long-term impact of the decisions made. While reimbursing those affected may provide immediate relief, it could also set a precedent for future hacks and potentially impact the sustainability of the protocol. Conversely, not reimbursing those affected may damage the reputation of the protocol and community trust.

•	Public Goods funding
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Public Goods are notoriously difficult to fund, yet more often than not, they provide enormous aid to all. Web 3.0 (crypto, or whatever else you’d like to call this space) is the one place where we can transcend our geography and help be a part of something larger and more impactful than any single person could hope to be by themselves.
Similar to OP (don’t lynch me), we should have a dedicated process for “doing as much good for as many people as possible”. There are a number of ways to set this up, but primarily by leveraging the power of quadratic voting and amplifying this mechanism to distribute the maximal good for the maximum amount of people in the fairest way possible.
It is easy to get caught up in the tunnel vision of Web 3, yet the majority of the time the greatest innovations are in the real world. Developing a roadmap to marry some of these ‘outside’ impactful solutions to the power of transparency, immutability, & ownership (via web 3) will be my top priority.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 71
•	Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
•	For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also a concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
•	This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.
Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?

Against
2.	What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?


Ensure that allocations are based of LONG-TERM commitments (sustainable activity based actions that are designed to promote long term use cases)
**2)	In this case; either reduce the seats (3/7), to 2, and make sure that a total of 5 (2/3 majority) are needed to change any structural matters. **
3)	Expand the Oversight committee to 5 seats, giving them 2, and splitting up the last 3. Ensure that a 60% majority (3/5) need to agree.



How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?


**People in position of ‘power’ should have **
**1.	A staked (vested) interest- with slash potentiality **
**2.	Doxxed- Anyone that wishes to represent the ecosystem and have the ability to wrought massive change must be able to be accountable for. **
3.	Temperature check, using a quadratic function, to gauge the masses input (i.e., the masses should preselect where they wish to take the ecosystem, the small team with central authority would then be responsible for implementation)

FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.

**Self-negligence- no reimbursement **
**2.	Smart contract hack- 50% reimbursement by the ecosystem (we are all aware of the risks associated with these novel protocols- and thus a 50/50 split is fair). **
3.	An insurance fund can be set up; users opting to pay into it (i.e., similar to royalties paid to NFT artists) will be eligible, pro-rata, to the maximum reimbursement possible. **
4.	There should be a concept of FDIC style insurance:
**	Users with less than X amount in their accounts should be made whole. This protects users who don’t have significant funds, and for whom the loss would be catastrophic. (i.e., scanning all addresses associated with a wallet. If the total amount of crypto held by Y individual is less than X amount, and was concentrated in this one protocol, should have max priority when reimbursing the community)

NFT development on Arbitrum
Gaming development on Arbitrum

I have been using Arbitrum since Professor Patten, and the team moved TreasureDao over in the fall of 2021, and never did I care or want an airdrop. The pain of fees and speed on L1 is what made me move to L2, and the culture of Arbitrum got me to stay.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
1, I am against too much much control
2. Adjust the proposal to have more seats and diversify those seats across multiple people and organizations. Remove the title of Supreme Being from Nic Carter on the proposal. I get that he is an intelligent guy, and this title is likely a joke, but for newcomers, this would scream that he is not open to others’ opinions and rub people the wrong way.
3. Having a larger, more diverse group of individuals required to vote would allow you to get things done and showcase that many minds were involved in this decision.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
I participated in the TRIBE/FEI launch, and I believe many mistakes were made. However, a vote is a vote, and I would stick with the first vote, full reimbursement, because that is what the voters selected first. We can’t just keep creating proposals until we get our way.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

Our Vision

Voluntary commitment
Since the name of DAO is “Autonomous Decentralization”, there is no specific authority. In the “company”, the “CEO” makes decisions and gives instructions to the “employees”. In “DAO”, there is no “CEO” in the first place. Of course, there is no concept of “employee” either. In DAOs, the pyramid structure is basically negated. The premise of working at DAO is that “everyone actively demonstrates his/her special abilities and contributes to the project”. You are always a “proposer” and a “contributor”, and the DAO needs your advice and contributions. It can be said that in order to work in DAO, your project and your interests need to have a high degree of fit. Your contribution is maximized when “what you can/want to do” and “what the DAO should do” overlap. If you work for a DAO, no one will give you directions. If you can contribute a lot, you will be recognized as a “core contributor” and will be rewarded and honored.

Regardless of age, gender or nationality, pay for performance and participate anonymously
In the past, when working at a company, it was necessary to verify the identity of a person, but at DAOs, this common sense is outdated. When you work for the DAO, you are not required to provide more personal information than is necessary. Because DAOs are anonymous, they are also paid per contribution. Regardless of your age, gender or nationality, what matters is your contribution to the DAO. Prehistoric worker spirits, such as “work earlier than others, show loyalty” and “be loyal to your boss” are completely a thing of the past. Welcome to a flat, pay-for-performance society.

Rewards are tokens
Last but not least, the price of the contribution is the “project issued token”. If you work for a company, we will “receive fiat currency by bank transfer”. “Receive tokens in a cryptocurrency wallet” is common sense when working at DAOs. Accepting fiat currency as a reward can be considered a special case. Tokens earned as rewards can be sold on the spot or held and managed as-is. If you think your project will grow, you may not sell it but buy more. These tokens are usually so-called “governance (voting) tokens”. The more you contribute, the more governance tokens you earn. You can reflect your intentions and interests in important decisions on your project. Using rewards as tokens to create some kind of gameplay is also an innovation of DAO.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Voting is the key to democracy, and how to effectively distribute power to everyone is worth exploring.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are decentralized in nature, meaning they do not have a central authority. However, this can lead to challenges when it comes to decision making and performing actions.
The first step in addressing this tradeoff is to analyze the organization’s goals, structure, and community. It is important to understand how decentralized the organization should be in order to achieve its objectives. A good balance between centralization and decentralization is crucial.
One way to ensure that the organization is well managed without compromising its decentralized nature is to establish smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing sets of codes that enable the organization to function autonomously. These contracts can be designed to enable voting and other forms of decision-making by stakeholders within the organization.
Another strategy is to establish clear guidelines and protocols for decision-making and operations. This could include selecting or electing a group of stakeholders who make decisions on behalf of the organization, or a consensus-based decision-making approach.
Ultimately, the key to maintaining a successful DAO is to strike a balance between centralization and decentralization. The core purpose of a DAO is to enable its members to work together collaboratively towards a common goal. Striking a balance between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is necessary to achieve this purpose.

How aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?

2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
What will help is to predetermine the formation of committees at the outset and demarcate the members it should have by increasing diversity against self-interest. People who pursue the goal of “quickly drain the currency and leave” should be removed.
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
everything has its place. But I lean more towards the decentralization answer, since that is what independence is all about.

Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO, if a small group centralizes power, the name DAO is only an aggregate.
Something that can help is to predefine in the beginning the creation of committees and delimit the members it should have at the expense of increasing diversity against personal interests.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is a bad reference to the DAOs, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree, but I feel that the committees or delegates fulfill that vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize the governance processes.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

My stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The goal of the DAO in liquidity mining should be to create a sustainable and efficient network that benefits all users. This means that the rewards program should be designed in a way that encourages long-term participation and doesn’t create a “pump and dump” scenario where users only provide liquidity for the rewards and then withdraw their funds once the rewards dry up.
The DAO should also prioritize fairness in its rewards distribution. This means that the rewards should be distributed based on each user’s contribution to the network rather than simply the amount of liquidity they provide.
Overall, the perfect network like Arbitrum should aim to strike a balance between incentivizing users to provide liquidity and creating a sustainable and fair rewards program that benefits all participants. The DAO should prioritize the long-term health of the network over short-term gains and work towards creating a decentralized and efficient system that can compete with traditional financial systems.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would oppose the current Uniswap proposal. Although I recognize that bounties can be a valuable tool for drawing new users to the platform, I am concerned about the extent of power and control that the proposal would give to Flipside crypto. In my opinion, this arrangement could pave the way for the centralization of authority and could place Flipside at an unfair advantage.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I am of the opinion that the reimbursement of victims of the Rari hack is a complex matter that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. Although I sympathize with those impacted by the hack, it’s important to carefully evaluate the potential pros and cons of reimbursing them.
In my perspective, the decision to reimburse parties affected by a hack should consider several factors, such as the severity of the attack, its impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. Depending on the specific case, full reimbursement may be justified if the attack was particularly harmful or a result of a fundamental issue within the platform. However, in other instances, it may not be practical or suitable to provide full reimbursement.
Overall, I believe that each reimbursement decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of the situation. As a delegate, my goal would be to ensure that the interests of all community members are represented impartially and that decisions are made transparently and responsibly.

Liquidity mining is something that should only be focused on when value is either being lost or  over inflated. Liquidity mining should be left alone. Unless the assets used to liquidity mine has a stable passive yield. Also with sound assets to liquidity mine behind it. The goal of the DAO is to increase adoption of an cheaper, transparent, faster ecosystem that can aid in supporting the world’s growing technological infrastucture needs.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
The biggest i hear is on account abstraction and how it can help with mainstream adoption. It allows more secure enablements of wallet usecases. Since arbitrum is cheaper I would like to see the mainstream adoption of Smart Contract wallets onchain. Currently multisigs are the crown jewel of secure wallet nature. However Smart contract wallets could allow more diverse usecases. Such as algorithmic changes to the underlying assets in the wallet.

It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

NFT development on Arbitrum
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .

From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.

These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!

Issue Overview 117
Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

My overall goal for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders. While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool, it should be approached cautiously with a long-term perspective to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem. I am committed to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible asset management, and a proactive and collaborative approach to address concerns and build trust.

mi postura sobre las dao cuando son excesivamente fuertes con la mineria de liquidez es que da poca confianza en el proyecto y poca trasparencia, dando a entender que muy posiblemente las DAO esten manipulando el precio del token a su beneficion. Por eso pienso que lo mejor para las dao es llevarlo todo a su tiempo, asi genera confianza y un sistema mas estable sin tanta volatilidad, sabiendo que es un inicio de todo proyecto
My position on the DAO when they are excessively strong with liquidity mining is that it gives little confidence in the project and little transparency, implying that the DAOs are very possibly manipulating the price of the token to their benefit. That is why I think that the best thing for dao is to take everything on time, thus generating confidence and a more stable system without so much volatility, knowing that it is the beginning of any project.
The goal of the DAO is to be able to finance the project through liquidity provided by the community, highlighting its decentralization. Once it is in operation, all the decisions on how that money will be moved are made through a consensus among those who participated in said dao.

In my opinion the goal of a DAO is to create a decentralized organization that is more efficient, transparent, and democratic than traditional centralized organizations. DAOs have the potential to revolutionize the way organizations are run by eliminating the need for intermediaries and enabling direct participation and decision-making by members of the community.
Sample voting Issue 1:


Against


It may be helpful to engage in further discussion and collaboration with other analytics service providers to ensure a more decentralized approach and to address any concerns about centralization of power. Additionally, it may be helpful to provide greater transparency and oversight of the allocation of UNI tokens to bounties to ensure fairness and prevent favoritism.


The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex issue that requires a careful balance. On one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear direction and swift decision-making, which can be important for efficient execution of tasks and achieving goals. On the other hand, excessive centralization can lead to lack of transparency, accountability, and innovation, which can ultimately harm the organization and limit its growth. To strike the right balance, it’s important to have clear guidelines and processes in place for decision-making and delegation of authority. This can include creating clear roles and responsibilities, establishing a chain of command, and providing transparency and oversight mechanisms. Additionally, involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, such as through democratic or consensus-based approaches, can help ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of the organization as a whole, rather than just a select few.


Sample Voting Issue 2:
Split Reimbursement
It may be appropriate to split the reimbursement between the affected parties and the platform or ecosystem. This can help to share the cost of the exploit and prevent the platform from bearing the full burden of the loss.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific circumstances and impact of the exploit. It is important to carefully consider the potential consequences of any decision, both for the affected parties and for the overall ecosystem.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I would vote against the proposal in its current form, as it seems to grant Flipside Crypto excessive control over allocating UNI to bounties and overseeing the entire program. This situation contradicts Ethereum’s core values of decentralization and inclusivity.
To address these concerns, I would suggest the following amendments to the proposal:
Revise the allocation committee structure to ensure fair representation from various stakeholders, including other analytics service providers. This could involve reducing Flipside’s seats and allocating them to representatives from other organizations.
Introduce a more balanced oversight committee, which includes members from different analytics service providers, ensuring that no single organization has disproportionate influence.
In terms of striking a balance between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, I believe it’s crucial to maintain a collaborative environment. By involving a diverse group of stakeholders in decision-making, we can ensure that various perspectives are considered while still maintaining efficiency in execution. This approach allows us to benefit from collective wisdom without compromising on agility and responsiveness.

Full Reimbursement
No Reimbursement
Split Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
In this situation, I would choose Split Reimbursement. It’s important to acknowledge the loss suffered by the affected parties while also considering the DAO’s responsibility and the potential moral hazard that full reimbursement might create.
My reasoning for choosing Split Reimbursement is based on the following principles:
Shared responsibility: Both the protocol developers and the users should share responsibility in the event of an exploit. The developers should strive to create a secure environment, and users must acknowledge the inherent risks of participating in the ecosystem.
Encouraging vigilance: Partial reimbursement can help maintain a sense of accountability among users and developers, incentivizing them to stay vigilant and contribute to the security and stability of the ecosystem.
Financial sustainability: A split reimbursement approach considers the DAO’s long-term financial health and the need to allocate resources judiciously.
I believe reimbursement decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors such as the severity of the exploit, the extent of the damage, and the role of the affected parties. Instances where reimbursement may be appropriate could include those where the DAO or protocol developers have a clear responsibility for the security flaw, and the affected users have acted in good faith. In contrast, reimbursement might not be suitable when users have knowingly engaged in risky behavior or when reimbursing would pose a significant threat to the financial sustainability of the DAO

I actively participate in community onboarding, DAO marketing efforts, and discord moderation. I love welcoming new members and implementing tools to help improve the way-finding process. I believe the next few years are a crucial time to build and improve the Web3 infrastructure and allow the next wave of individuals to join our incredible space!
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Prompts to Answer:


How would you vote?
For - I believe there should be ample time for discussions, in a public Forum, as well as evidence of alternate announcements on Discord/Twitter before a proposal is launched. This allows time for all opinions to be shared with transparency.


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would agree with other posts in this thread that Quarterly distributions with committee oversight “check points” will allow the originally intended proposal to launch. If there is underlying, centralized, malicious behavior put in place by individuals at Flipside Crypto, or evidence of clear nepotism in selecting seats for allocations of funding, the Committee could step in - as a backstop -  to prevent further manipulation.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I am an active participant, voting guild member, and council member in several DAO’s. I am very excited about the potential to operate organizations, projects, and products transparently and decentralized from authority. This has many pitfalls in practice however, because of the additional burden of open sourced decision making.
More often than not, it is faster to simply “do” a task, than it is to coordinate a team or assign a role. For this reason in some of the Committees I serve on, individuals tend to take on responsibilities, rather than delegating them to a larger pool of contributors. This is widely know as Voter Fatigue, or Contributor Fatigue and causes members to drop out after a short time.


Sample Voting Issue 2:
Issue Overview:
Prompts to Answer:
should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not?
I am in favor of a Split Reimbursement in this situation.
I feel it is the responsibility of the project or DAO to reasonably protect the interests of its community, treasury, and ongoing operations. A part of this responsibility is to compensate those members of the community that fund, and therefore allow the ecosystem to function.
The DAO and Project however are not traditional financial institutions, nor should they be required to insure 100% of each individuals investment - even the FDIC sets a limit on the amount it will insure for each account holder.
It is easy for some DAO’s to refund losses due to hacks, because of the positive impact it creates in reputation. But automatically refunding each hack sets a precedence, imho encouraging future behavior. In this instance I would rather see a 1:1 reimbursement where stakeholders received 50% of their losses refunded, and the DAO used the other 50% to actively apprehend the hacker, or actively stop all and any future hacks from happening - by upgrading the ecosystem.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The final goal of DAO is to build a mechanism to unite the community and give back some of the rights of the protocol to the community members.
The decentralization progress of a protocol/project can be gradual. So the decentralized and full responsibilities of a DAO can also be gradual.

I actually posted my opinion on this issue before the merge finished:
My Response to Fei Rari Merge Proposal
I am against the merge proposal and I listed specific reasons. Basically, I think the risk between DAOs should be separated in case of a hack. Unfortunately, what I am worried about becomes reality in a few months later.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Only partnership, no merge of DAO.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

Decentralization is the final goal, before that, we can do it in a centralized way to implement some of the tools first.

NFT development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
This is a very broad question. My experience as the founder of ANDAO has taught me that DAOs are not only different from companies, but also different from communities. We often equate DAO with the community. Actually, it is not. The community is just a subordinate concept to a DAO, which is a community governance organization that eschews the centralized governance ways of a company. Therefore, governance is very important for DAOs. Lack of proper governance rules, then DAO can’t be called DAO, but only, community. So I think the ultimate goal of DAO is to explore a set of community governance rules that work, and to implement and protect all the rules through blockchain technology.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Prompts to Answer:
How would you vote?
For! We are still in the very early days of DAO, so centralization and centralization of power are inevitable, and it will take us a decade or even decades to perfect the general rules of DAO. So don’t think about completely decentralizing all at once, that’s unrealistic and not necessarily good for the community and users.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Nope.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Embrace decentralization, but don’t be afraid of temporary centralization. Whether it’s a company, a DAO, or a community, a job requires one person to do it, and a task requires one person to complete it. So as long as we keep it open and transparent, and write the rights and obligations of the executors clearly inside the governance rules, this is not a problem. Giving proper incentives to the executors and having someone responsible for monitoring is a good rule.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Full Reimbursement
For general users, they join crypto mainly for profit. So protecting the safety of users’ money is the most important and basic thing. No matter how good we do in other aspects, if we can’t protect the safety of users’ money, then we are doomed to fail. That’s why full Reimbursement is necessary.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
In my opinion, the primary goal of the DAO should be to enhance liquidity mining effectiveness while maintaining decentralization, safeguarding member rights, and promoting sustainable development of the project. We should actively expand liquidity mining operations, ensuring fair competition and transparency, in order to attract more users to participate and increase the value of the project.

Consider these condensed strategies:




Foster collaboration and consensus-based decision-making.


Assign clear roles and responsibilities.


Implement governance mechanisms like voting and multi-signature contracts.


Establish checks and balances to distribute authority.


Embrace transparency in decision-making and communication.


Regularly reassess the balance between centralization and efficiency.


Leverage technology and automation to streamline operations.


Encourage a diverse and inclusive community.

Be willing to iterate and adapt the DAO’s structure as needed.
By implementing these strategies, a DAO can achieve efficiency without compromising decentralization and community involvement.


Sample Voting Issue 2:
I choose option 3: Split Reimbursement. This approach balances the needs of affected users, financial sustainability, and security improvement for the DAO.
Reasoning:


Shared responsibility between developers and users.


Maintain the DAO’s financial sustainability.


Incentivize security improvements.


Refund appropriateness depends on the circumstances:




Appropriate: DAO or project team negligence.


Not appropriate: User disregard for warnings or risky behavior.
A split reimbursement fairly addresses the issue while considering the DAO’s long-term prospects.

The goals of the DAO should reflect that of the community. This means an ever evolving and changes system to meet the needs of the community that supports it. It’s broad, but it’s important to remain connected and evolve with the community.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

It’s important to have clear leadership but also to not have power centralized in one location. Having members voted in a “board of trustees” with short terms that overlap one another could be a potential solution, with also a challenge to the board for any potential issues. You could also have board assistant who are trained to investigate and bring issues to the board to minimize the amount of noise so they can be as effective as possible.

My stance on overall goals for the DAOs:
The definite goal of DAO is always decentralization. The incentive of getting rewards by DAOs always comes from liquidity mining but it’s a high risk strategy.
The goal of liquidity mining is to rewards but at a good ratio and it should be aligned with the needs and priorities of the member of community.

*No amendments, just support that you should do it with a reasonable ratio
*For any organization, including DAOs, the trade-off between centralization of authority and the capacity to accomplish tasks is a common challenge. One way that centralization of power can speed up execution and make better use of resources is by establishing clear leadership and decision-making. However, excessive centralization can stifle innovation, curtail participation, and result in decisions that don’t take the needs and priorities of the larger community into account.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Flipside would need to be sufficiently decentralized and have a proper DAO framework to be even considered for this level of power over such a large project.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

There are great examples of both fully decentralized DAOs, and their ability to filter and fasttrack development, but there are also great examples of centralized teams that get things done and are able to have the agility to develop fast.
In the growth phase of a project agility is important to sustain growth, but as the gov tokens disperse, they should aim to hand the keys over to a DAO.
putting the tag DAO on the name doesn’t cover this. The keys need to be burnt, or given to the DAO.
At the protocol level, “chain” it is much more important that as the project level.

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization operates based on smart contracts and runs on a blockchain. Its members can make decisions and manage the organization’s assets through a consensus mechanism.
I am not the biggest fan of liquidity mining, at least not directly from a DAO; I think that in the best of many cases the best is to apply to different protocols that kind of incentives, maybe like Optimism that brought diverse uses to its network incentivizing it in an indirect way in usability and ecosystem.

The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is an important consideration in any organization, including a DAO. On the one hand, a centralized authority can make decisions quickly and efficiently, but it can also lead to potential abuses of power and lack of transparency. On the other hand, a decentralized approach can lead to more transparency and democratic decision-making, but it may also lead to slower decision-making processes and inefficiencies.

Position on DAO’s overall goals:
The overall goals of a DAO can vary widely depending on the nature of the organization and the objectives of its members. Some DAOs focus on investing in blockchain projects, while others may prioritize social impact, governance, or even art. Ultimately, the goal of a DAO is to provide a decentralized platform for its members to collaborate and achieve their shared objectives without relying on traditional centralized systems.
Some potential overall goals for a DAO could include:

Financial returns: DAOs may focus on investing in blockchain projects or cryptocurrencies with the aim of generating financial returns for their members.
Governance: DAOs can provide a platform for decentralized decision-making, where members have a say in how the organization is run and what projects to pursue.
Social impact: DAOs can also prioritize social impact by supporting initiatives that align with their values and mission.
Innovation: DAOs can be a hub for innovation, where members can collaborate on new ideas and technologies, and experiment with new business models.

Ultimately, the overall goals of a DAO will depend on the interests and values of its members, and how they choose to use the decentralized platform to achieve their objectives.",156

The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact Para Swap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralization of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).

Overview
Hello everyone! We’re Penn Blockchain/FranklinDAO a leading, completely student run blockchain organization with students from The University of Pennsylvania’s undergraduate and graduate schools. We have over 300 general body members and are expecting many more in the semesters to come!
We have committees covering Governance, Research, Education, Investments, and Development/Web3. On the governance side of things, our team has different members leading governance initiatives for different protocols we have delegations for. Current Penn Blockchain delegations include Aave, Compound, Uniswap, DyDx, Optimism, Maker, etc. Each week, governance leads will share updates with the club about new proposals and we will all debate about what to do before voting with our wallet.
Core Values
We are deeply committed to preserving defi’s core values, and will gear our voting decisions based on:


Transparency: Committed to ensuring transparency of the protocol, and transparency about our decision-making process. We are committed to acting independently without external influence from third-parties. We’re always open to answering questions related to our votes on proposals, and will have a running thread up shortly to publicly display our opinions on votes.


Sustainability: We are committed to ensuring the long term sustainability and health of the DAOs we participate in and aim to help them steward their native protocols in perpetuity.


Inclusivity: Forging the best ideas requires diversity, fairness, and education, and we will strive to encourage these.


We’d love to be your Arbitrum delegate as many of us have been closely following the chain for a while now. Our weekly discussions combine graduates with years of expertise in many jurisdictions with many bright minded undergrads eager to leave their impact and names in Web3. We have upheld a 95%+ participation rate across all the other protocols we are delegates for and plan to spend a lot of time here as well to help build out the ecosystem!

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I believe the overall goals for DAO should be to keep the blockchain fair and accessible for all. The purpose of any DAO is to give voting power back to the people. The arbitrum DAO should be no different, and we should be giving people of the community to voice their opinion about changes to the way things will work in the community.
The DAO should incentivize active participation in the community when it comes to providing LP, voting, and using protocols. The DAO should also incentivize developers to launch projects on Arbitrum.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Centralized authorities need at least 1 seat each at the table, but the community should be able to decide how things progress. The centralized authorities should be allowed to make proposals as to how UNI is allocated, but the community should have an equal amount of power when it comes to allowing these proposals to pass.

Split Reimbursement

I would choose an initial split reimbursement. Individuals using a platform are not responsible for an exploit hack, but they also knew the risks of using the protocol. They should be made whole, but not at the cost of the protocol being killed in the process. Individuals should be refunded somewhere around 60% of their funds initially, and the remainder should be reimbursed at a later date. The funds initially allocated for the entire refund should be left with the protocol to allow them to use it for development and prevent such an attack from happening in the future. There should be some sort of time proposed, such as a year time, when individuals should be refunded the remainder of their lost funds.
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.

These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reinbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors.  A full reinbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will obviously be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionaly, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which although is also part of the wider ethereum ecosystem it could be considered a conflict of interest. Currently, I am being allocated ~ 1k OP. In addition to this, ParaSwap has also been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme recipients, and if necessary, the representative of ParaSwap could be a different DAO member if this is considered a major conflict of interest. Personally, I believe that the growth of any decentralised rollup on the Ethereum ecosystem is a net positive for everyone in the space, and I will do my best to lend my knowledge in bettering the entire space ",165

I am not the biggest fan of liquidity mining, at least not directly from a DAO.

Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO, if a small group centralizes power, the name DAO is only an aggregate.
Something that can help is to predefine in the beginning the creation of committees and delimit the members it should have at the expense of increasing diversity against personal interests.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is a bad reference to the DAOs, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree. But I feel that the committees or delegates fulfill that vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize the governance processes.

A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and also take into account their survival, therefore it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, by literally draining their funds I do not think they can pay.
That’s why I think the best thing to do, and depending on the case like FEI, is to return money to those affected, maybe under a vesting system or the DAO can get down to work to look after the interests of its users.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a general term used to describe a group of individuals who form an organization and make decisions on its direction collectively using a decentralized model. The goals of a DAO depend entirely on the objectives of that particular organization.
As we are discussing the Arbitrum DAO, our goal is to determine a direction that will guide the chain towards sustainable growth in every possible way. For instance, we may vote for the ecosystem fund to finance projects that promote genuine adoption rather than Ponzi schemes. This is a critical step in bootstrapping the chain for long-term growth.
This is just one example, but it provides a sense of how we approach the DAO. As a decentralized organization, we make decisions together with the goal of promoting ecosystem growth that benefits everyone in some way.

Granting excessive control to any one group is not advisable, particularly in a decentralized context. I recommend that we reject the proposal due to the significant concerns surrounding it, which cannot be adequately addressed through amendments.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The structure of this DAO seems to be somewhat flawed. To overcome the centralization of voting power, it may be necessary to establish a committee at the early stages. It would also be wise to propose a plan to gradually increase the decentralization of the DAO over time. As the DAO becomes more decentralized over time, this issue should be resolved.

Full Reimbursement

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.

This issue is complex and highlights a weakness of DAOs. While DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, individuals within the organization tend to act in their own best interests rather than for the survival of the organization as a whole. In reality, people tend to decide what benefits themselves most, rather than the other way around.
For issues of this magnitude, it would be best to seek the expertise of domain experts rather than relying solely on the DAO. Since this issue could have life or death implications for the organization, it is essential to note this and take steps to prevent similar situations from arising in the future.
I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding whether reimbursement should be made in full, split, or not at all, as it would require a detailed breakdown for the benefit of everyone involved. However, this situation provides an example of how DAOs should handle such matters.

Split Reimbursement. It is important to consider that loss of funds can harm people’s trust in the space and deter them from onboarding. Therefore, at least a partial reimbursement should be considered to thank the parties for trusting the protocol’s security. However, a full reimbursement may not be appropriate in severe cases where it could lead to negative impacts on the protocol’s bottom line or even closure.

NFT development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The overall goal of the DAO is to enable community governance of the Arbitrum network.
The primary objectives of the Arbitrum One DAO include promoting the decentralization and transparency of the network’s governance, ensuring the security and stability of the network, and facilitating the growth and adoption of the network.
By providing a decentralized platform for community governance, the DAO will aim to foster greater trust and collaboration among the network’s participants, while also promoting the long-term sustainability and success of the Arbitrum network.
We can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:


Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.


Liquidity Mining - The goal of the DAO should be to promote the long-term sustainability and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem, which includes the liquidity and trading volume on the platform. To achieve this goal, the DAO may choose to pursue liquidity mining strategies that incentivize market participants to provide liquidity and increase trading volume.
However, it is important to balance the potential benefits of liquidity mining with the risks involved, such as impermanent loss, volatility, and exposure to smart contract risks. The DAO should carefully consider the potential risks and rewards of liquidity mining and make decisions that are aligned with the long-term goals of the ecosystem and the interests of its members.
In short, the aggressiveness of liquidity mining should be based on the DAO’s risk appetite, strategic goals, and the current market conditions, with a focus on promoting the long-term sustainability and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.


These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reinbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors.  A full reinbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

Sample Voting Issue 1:


Against


Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO. If a small group centralizes power, the name DAO is merely an aggregate. To increase diversity against personal interests, it can be helpful to predefine the creation of committees in the beginning and delimit the members it should have.


The more decentralized a DAO is, the more difficult it is to reach an agreement. However, I believe that committees or delegates fulfill a vital function of representing the voice of many to optimize governance processes.


Sample Voting Issue 2:
• Split Reimbursement
A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members while also considering their survival. Therefore, depending on the cases and type of hack, draining their funds to pay is not a good approach. Instead, the DAO can return the money to those affected, perhaps under a vesting system, or work to look after the interests of its users.

Liquidity mining is a great way to grow community and also incentivizing liquidity providers increases community, and trust. I think in this days of growth, adoption and development, Arbitrum needs to be fairly aggressive.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
I would vote against. I feel like the whole proposal, and setup is lopsided and does not tilt towards a more democratic system which is the whole basis of DAOs.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would reduce the amount of control that Flipside has on allocation and the number of seats on the committee.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Centralization does help to get things done. However, the more democratic system requires decentralization and with DAOs where the majority agrees or disagrees, things can either get done or not. Getting things done should not be more important than community vote if the community is against what is to be done.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
First, I wonder why a vote that has already been passed is being re-proposed. That is more double Jeopardy than anything. Since the first vote passed for reimbursement, I would vote for full reimbursement.
I believe that where the DAO decides, parties should be reimbursed for exploits.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is an organization that operates through rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts. The goals of a DAO are determined by its members and can vary depending on the DAO’s purpose. Some common goals of DAOs include:

Decentralization: DAOs aim to eliminate central authorities and intermediaries and operate in a decentralized manner, with decisions made by a consensus of its members.
Transparency: DAOs strive to be transparent in their decision-making processes and the allocation of their resources.
Community-driven: DAOs are often driven by a community of like-minded individuals who share a common goal.
Governance: DAOs aim to establish a system of governance that ensures fair and equitable decision-making processes.
Efficiency: DAOs strive to operate in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

Overall, the goals of a DAO are determined by its members and can vary depending on the DAO’s purpose and the needs of its community.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty


How would you vote?
For


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?


One potential amendment could be to adjust the allocation committee and oversight committee to have a more balanced representation of stakeholders and analytics service providers, rather than giving an overwhelming amount of control to one entity. Additionally, it may be beneficial to have more transparency and communication with the broader Uniswap community to ensure that their concerns and perspectives are taken into account.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

To approach this tradeoff, it’s important to consider the specific context and goals of the organization or project. In some cases, centralizing authority may be necessary for achieving a specific outcome or moving quickly in a rapidly changing environment. In other cases, a more decentralized approach may be preferable for promoting inclusivity, diversity of ideas, and avoiding potential conflicts of interest.
One potential solution is to strike a balance between centralization and decentralization, by delegating decision-making power to smaller teams or committees that are representative of different stakeholders or perspectives. Another approach could be to implement checks and balances, such as regular review processes or accountability measures, to ensure that centralized authority is used responsibly and effectively.
Ultimately, the approach to balancing centralization and decentralization depends on the specific circumstances and goals of the organization or project, and requires careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits of each approach.
Split Reimbursement
In terms of handling the situation, it is important to consider the impact on the affected parties and the overall health of the ecosystem. Reimbursement may be necessary in certain instances, particularly when the loss was due to a security vulnerability that was beyond the control of the affected parties. However, it is also important to ensure that reimbursement is not abused and that it does not encourage risky behavior.
In the case of the FEI RARI hack, it would be important to thoroughly investigate the circumstances of the hack and determine whether reimbursement is appropriate. If it is determined that reimbursement is necessary, then the amount and terms of the reimbursement should be carefully considered to ensure that it is fair and does not incentivize risky behavior.
In general, I believe that reimbursement should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific circumstances of each incident. There may be instances where full reimbursement is appropriate, while in other cases, partial or no reimbursement may be warranted. Ultimately, the decision should be made based on a careful assessment of the situation and the impact on the ecosystem as a whole.

Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization


Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The goal of the DAO is to maximize protocol growth, while minimizing decreases in decentralization (in my opinion, this is more important then growth). This involves reading, understanding and voting on AIPs proposed to or by Arbitrum, aswell as enforcing standards for said AIPs. The DAO should be impartial, as much as it can be being staffed by humans. If the community signals support for AIPs, delegates should trend toward the overall consensus for smaller issues, while drawing hard lines in the sand in matters of decentralization.
Arbitrums future success depends on it being neutral, secure and as decentralized as possible. Liquidity incentives are less important for a pure governance token like $ARB (opinion) then getting the token into the hands of as many people interested in contributing as possible. Provide enough liquidity to make the token easily accessible to all who want to join in the governance process, and prevent huge spikes in either direction in price.
Sample Issue 1: Uniswap Flipside committee centralization issue
If I were voting on this today, I would vote “for”, with amendments. 3/7 committee members for fund allocation is high - it only requires convincing (or bribing?) 1 extra member to move forward. I would try and amend this to 2 seats. If Flipside wants to allocate funds a specific way, they should be made to have an argument for it at least convincing enough to get 2 more votes.
I approach the “getting things done” aspect with the goal being to be the most trusted of the secondary baselayers of Ethereum. In this particular case, I think since Flipside is doing most of the work in this proposal, with the express purpose of driving traffic and tooling to Uniswap… Its pretty much all upside for Uniswap if they succeed, with very little downside if they fail. They should have an easier time making changes because of this, but I still think amending to 2 votes required from other council members is enough to require them to justify their choice with a thought out proposal, but not enough to provide excessive friction in moving forward.
Sample Issue 2: RARI exploit and repayment votes
This is a tough one, but in the end I would have voted for Full Reimbursement. This seems to have been RARI’s contracts that were at fault, they even had previous hacks that should have prompted a stronger review of their codebase. The users of the protocol were innocent in this, and they rightfully put it to a vote. The community decided to reimburse users, and RARI paid for their mistake out of pocket.
In events like this, context is important. Say for Arbitrum, if a layer 3 spins up their own chain on Arbitrums layer 2 and that chain gets exploited because of poor security and audits of the codebase on that chain… there should be no reimbursement from Arbitrum itself for the affected users. If Arbitrums code is the reason for the draining of a child chain, or the bridge were to be drained etc… I am of the mind user reimbursement will go further towards restoring the core value of the protocol (trust), then protecting the treasury in specific s\circumstances. Funds can be recovered, users often cannot.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability.

The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionaly, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which although is also part of the wider ethereum ecosystem it could be considered a conflict of interest.

Liquidity is the blood of the ecosystem. No liquidity means the blockchain is dead and no one needs it. We don’t have to be aggressive in extracting liquidity. We need to create good conditions for liquidity to be added naturally and stored securely. The main task of the DAO is to form the principles of fair management of the protocol. Decisions made must be in the interest of Arbitrum’s development, not of individuals.

I would suggest a few conditions to choose from. Strengths and weaknesses should have been added to the proposal. In this case, I will not write it in detail, because the proposal has already been accepted and it has no practical value
It is important to listen to influential members of the community to make important decisions. There must be enough of them to respect the principles of decentralization, because DAOs are not always decentralized. A compromise can also be options when the proposal is implemented in stages, that is, gradually. At each stage, you can monitor the effectiveness and make changes if necessary.

Sample Voting Issue 2:

Split Reimbursement
Users should feel safe entrusting their funds to protocols. That’s why reimbursement is the right policy. Users are not to blame if protocol management missed something and there were exploits/backdoors.

However, reimbursing everyone will set a precedent: projects can be scammers and do their own hacks of their protocols.  That’s why I think that most protocols should insure themselves, to be able to cover costs, at least partially.
Also, there should be strict controls and security checks on smart contracts. Without an audit, the protocol should not be allowed to operate.

As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.

Sample Voting Issue 1: Uniswap/Flipside
Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?

For

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Depending on the current bylaws one could think of the vote of the chair counting double or having a veto power.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

The issue is not one of centralisation as this necessary to conduct meaningful decissions to which one was mandated by the community, rather how good are the checks and balances in place, which would depend on the bylaws. In the case of the oversight committee Flipside had only 1 of three seats. Unless unanimity is required, this would safeguard interests of the majority holders. Similar for the allocation committee. Additional solution could be as in 2. above.
Sample Voting Issue 2: FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not?

Full Reimbursement

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not:
A vote passed, therefore full reimbursement should be honoured.
However, a full reimbursement should not occure in the event that it would
1, threaten the existence of the protocol, or
2. the reasons for the hack are due to forces the protocol could not control or reasonably forsee given duty of care; or
3. the hack was facilitated by third party vulnerabilities used in the protocol for which they would be liable (would need to take recourse first and, if successful could consider redistribution).

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.

These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reinbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors.  A full reinbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will obviously be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionaly, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which although is also part of the wider ethereum ecosystem it could be considered a conflict of interest. Currently, I am being allocated ~ 1k OP. In addition to this, ParaSwap has also been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme recipients, and if necessary, the representative of ParaSwap could be a different DAO member if this is considered a major conflict of interest. Personally, I believe that the growth of any decentralised rollup on the Ethereum ecosystem is a net positive for everyone in the space, and I will do my best to lend my knowledge in bettering the entire space ",192

In my opinion, finding the right balance between aggressive and conservative approaches to liquidity mining is crucial for the DAO.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

How would you vote?

Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

The main objective of a DAO should be to foster diversity of opinions and participants. If power becomes centralized within a small group, the DAO loses its purpose and becomes nothing more than a collection of individuals. To prevent this, it can be helpful to establish committees and set clear membership criteria from the outset, with the aim of promoting diversity and avoiding conflicts of interest. By doing so, the DAO can ensure that decision-making is distributed across a wide range of perspectives, allowing it to function as a truly decentralized and inclusive organization.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It’s often said that decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can be challenging to govern because of the diversity of views and opinions involved. However, I believe that committees or delegates can play a vital role in representing the voices of many and streamlining the governance processes. While it’s true that greater decentralization can make it harder to reach consensus, having a representative group to help manage decision-making can enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the DAO. By empowering committees or delegates to act on behalf of the wider community, DAOs can strike a balance between decentralization and practicality, ensuring that everyone’s opinions are heard and valued.

Split Reimbursement

A DAO has a responsibility to create a favorable environment for its members and to ensure their survival. However, in the event of a hack, the appropriate response will depend on the circumstances and severity of the attack. It may not always be possible for the DAO to fully reimburse members if their funds have been drained.
In such cases, I believe that the best course of action is to consider returning money to those affected, potentially using a vesting system or other means of ensuring that funds are distributed fairly. Alternatively, the DAO could take proactive steps to protect the interests of its members by implementing stricter security measures and actively investigating any security breaches. Ultimately, the DAO should prioritize the needs and wellbeing of its members above all else, and work to find solutions that are equitable, transparent, and effective.

Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

I run a DAO and I would do my best to introduce them and be a great ambassador promoting products from arbitrum.
Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.

Liquidity mining is an important part of the decentralization process of a DAO. However, if done poorly with incentives for trivial, unimportant actions without long term alignment, it can easily become a net negative for the DAO and saddle the DAO with a large pool of disinterested, short term speculators.
Liquidity mining should be heavily weighted toward builders that bring value to the ecosystem. Builders can be technical, or non-technical, but again, it is important to screen for true value creation and balance it with the goals of long term decentralization.
The goal of the DAO should be to ensure the long term success of Arbitrum, expanding the reach and adoption of Arbitrum technology and to fund public goods built around the ecosystem.
The DAO should have a bias towards action.

Issue Overview 
Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?
Abstain

In this case, I was personally related to the parties involved in the proposal. Because of this, and my strong belief in transparency and clarity on conflicts of interest, I would abstain on this issue.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

If I were to improve the proposal, I would have suggested to include more tools for transparency and oversight on the process. I would have looked to take the various perspectives of the parties involved and tried to find a compromise that would further the goals of the proposal and help convince those who disagreed that it was a net positive for the ecosystem.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

The centralization of authority in limited amounts can be a net positive for the efficient of a DAO. However, this centralization of authority must be balanced by effective tools and transparency that allows the token holders to hold accountable those that are in positions of authority. There are many such tools coming available on the market now, so I think it’s reasonable that with a bias towards action, we could implement tooling solutions that can allow for efficient operation of a DAO, but without falling victim to capture and centralization.

FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
In this case I was an investor in one of the organizations attempting to get reimbursed, so I must decline to answer this example directly.
However on the general point of reimbursement, I am inclined to feel that DeFi Protocols should socialize losses as best as possible, minimizing the chance that any one participant in the ecosystem is overly harmed in the event of a hack or loss of funds. Of course this is dependent on the circumstances of the event, but while this space is still young and evolving, we should do our best to try and protect the vulnerable participants in the ecosystem from harm when possible and reasonable. This will not always be the case, or might not always be my perspective, but I’d like to err on the side of supporting users.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
I am the CEO and Co-Founder of Tally.xyz. This means i am privy to a variety of early information about DAOs and events in the DAO ecosystem. This also means Tally is at times a recipient of grants from DAO’s. Because of this, I pledge to refrain from participating in votes that I would have a clear conflict of interest in.I will also seek to decentralize my own delegation (potentially through a sub-DAO) if my delegators disagree with my actions. Otherwise I will make a good faith attempt to abstain from decisions that might be considered conflicts of interests, or in the event a decision requires my participation, but might be considered a conflict of interest, I will be guided by the majority opinion of the voters who have delegated to me. This should be possible, with some further research, by implementing it at the smart contract level through a sub-DAO in a trust-minimized manner.",207

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

DeFi development on Arbitrum.

Summoner DAO Foundation is a DAO focused on the procurement of ideas of opportunity for the community.  It is fully registered and actively banking in the United States with a decentralized treasury.  Summoner DAO is one of the few DAO’s in crypto that is natively deployed to Arbitrum with it’s governance token, SMNR, having been deployed to the network in late Fall of 2022.
Delegate voting goals:
In support of the Arbitrum Network and participants/holders, the DAO intends to vote towards proposals which enhance the development of innovative decentralized finance on Arbitrum, Arbitrum community events, encouragement of Arbitrum related sub-DAOs which will further grow the ecosystem outside of the participation of off-chain labs, and good governance enhancement to the DAO like quadratic voting.
Technical Voting Scenarios:


Uniswap concentrated voter authority in grant distribution.

Overconcentration of grants in a later stage token project can be catastrophic to the organization, however well-intentioned the proposal can leverage significant adoption and minority alignment can be efficient to productivity.  On chain monopolies can fester the core of a DAO and be a long-term detriment to ecosystem growth.
Solution:  Against but amend the proposal.  I would adjust the proposal to restrict Flipside Crypto’s weight to one vote, and pull 2 other analytics firms to the seats to enable better industry participation. The purpose of this change is to maintain minority composition of the grant committee outside of a supposed oligopoly, but also also for rich sophistication and precision in grant distributions to best grow the ecosystem.


Solving for the FEIRARI reimbursement.

Issue: How to solve for two separate votes on the same issue including the morality of the question resolved.
There is no simple solution to this one.  On one hand, the DAO should have the property of it’s voting power protected.  If a centralized organization were to go against the wishes of a DAO to refund the token holders, it would diminish the value of the voting rights in the DAO.  In other instances, it is amoral, can damage the brand, and may carry legal ramifications for an organization to not reimburse exploit victims.  Ultimately, the best solution to avoid moral hazard in voting is to leverage a delegated voting system (like the one Arbitrum is using) to maximize the tradeoff between populism and needs of the greater DAO.  Users need to be reimbursed for executions with a smart contract that penalize them and are not within the advertised intention of the contract.  The responsibility should be held by token holders if equity is not present to distribute.  If there is equity to distribute a join responsibility should be held by both parties.  Summoner DAO would vote yes to a refund.

Conflicts of interest:
The are members of the DAO who will vote in the best interest of the Arbitrum community and value decentralization broadly.  Membership is selective upon owning of SMNR token and acceptance in a plurality of participants voting.  That being said, some members have links to registered investment advisors, others have links to permissioned companies in web3, however no individual investment management company, DAO or foundation holds a controlling share of the tokens or participating in any verified voting decision on behalf of the DAO.

A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and also take into account their survival, therefore it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, by literally draining their funds I do not think they can pay.
That’s why I think the best thing to do, and depending on the case like FEI, is to return money to those affected, maybe under a vesting system or the DAO can get down to work to look after the interests of its users.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

Building a passionate community by setting up easy-to-use communication platforms, ensuring fair and transparent decision-making, and encouraging community-driven projects
Creating innovative solutions by identifying market gaps and building new products or services, fostering experimentation while thinking outside the box, and collaborating with other experts and projects to find synergies / integrations that push the boundary of the industry
Focus on long-term success and growth by establishing and refining the governance model to remain inclusive and transparent while forging partnerships with other projects and organizations to expand reach /impact
Implementing an effective liquidity mining initiative for network growth and adoption is critical to driving user adoption, however, it requires consistent reviews to ensure balance is achieved between a reward system that drives long-term commitment / usage and ensuring the focus of users doesn’t stray from the primary missions / goals of the DAO. I’m of the opinion that liquidity mining initiatives should act in waves to move from an aggressive position, to one where the effectiveness of that stance is measured, then adjusted moving into the next phase.

I’m not sure that any particular DAO has achieved an optimal model yet but we need to continue to push the industry status quo until we get it right.

Issue Overview 109

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:
1. How would you vote? Against
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any? If the proposal passed, Flipside should only  have 1 seat on the Allocation Committee and zero on the Oversight Committee to avoid conflicts of interest.
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Striking the right balance between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is crucial for any organization but especially critical in the context of a Web3 DAO (there have been plenty of examples for both arguments from the last couple of years). In my perspective, a successful approach involves progressive decentralization, starting with a more centralized structure for rapid decision-making and development, and gradually shifting towards decentralized governance as the DAO matures and users become bought into the success of the DAO (not always easy to achieve). Establishing a clear governance structure and designing a tokenomics model that aligns stakeholders’ interests ensures the effective functioning of both centralized and decentralized components.
I’m of the opinion that DAOs should utilize a hybrid decision-making model that combine centralized and decentralized processes in ways that actually make sense. It should facilitate effective communication between all parties however possible and provide a path forward to full decentralization. There should also be periodic evaluations and adjustments of the governance model to allow the organization to adapt to changing market conditions. This will also ensure both efficiency and inclusivity in decision-making while not sacrificing how long it takes to reach social consensus.

I would add in a trial period, during which governance had the authority to cancel the partnership if poor decisions are being made.
If we assume that Flipside is going to be the partner to run this campaign, they should have the authority and ability to act in the way they see best for the campaign to succeed. Ultimately the decision to start the partnership is decentralized.

DeFi Development on Arbitrum
Supporting Infrastructure

Stance on the Overall Goals for the DAO: It is crucial for Arbitrum to expand the economic sphere of Ethereum through the integration of multiple networks. Liquidity mining serves as a vital instrument for distributing governance over this mission, and should be pursued assertively during periods of stagnation and judiciously when the market is overheated.

Against
Given that the program outline and funding have been deemed acceptable, the proposal should be amended by adjusting the seating allocation for the two committees.
Centralization and decentralization often find themselves in opposition, as the former enables smoother execution of actions. Nevertheless, from a foundational perspective, a distinction can be drawn between a slower-acting DAO and agile service providers. In the case of the Uniswap bounty proposal, Flipside should maintain their ability to offer services (such as bounty suggestions) while relinquishing oversight and allocation power.

Proposed Approach: My stance on this issue is to advocate for Full Reimbursement. Given the experimental nature of such protocols, restoring brand value should not take precedence over ensuring the well-being of users, both directly and indirectly impacted. A DAO, in its pursuit of growth, should uphold the ethical principles of its constituents. This implies that individuals affected by an unfortunate event, not caused by their own actions, ought to receive support from those in their community.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.

These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will obviously be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionaly, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which although is also part of the wider ethereum ecosystem it could be considered a conflict of interest. Currently, I am being allocated ~ 1k OP. In addition to this, ParaSwap has also been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme recipients, and if necessary, the representative of ParaSwap could be a different DAO member if this is considered a major conflict of interest. Personally, I believe that the growth of any decentralised rollup on the Ethereum ecosystem is a net positive for everyone in the space, and I will do my best to lend my knowledge in bettering the entire space",222

In terms of the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of each approach. Centralizing authority can lead to quicker decision-making and implementation of programs, but it also increases the risk of abuse of power and favoritism. On the other hand, a decentralized approach may result in slower decision-making and implementation but provides a system of checks and balances to prevent abuse of power.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Full Reimbursement
provide full reimbursement to the affected parties. This approach may be appropriate if the hack was due to a flaw in the organization’s security systems or protocols. However, it is important to ensure that the reimbursement does not create a moral hazard that incentivizes reckless behavior.
I am writing to apply for the position of delegate on the Arbitrum network. I have been following the development of the Arbitrum network and I am excited about the potential it holds for the future of decentralized finance.
As a delegate, I believe I can contribute to the growth and development of the Arbitrum network. My technical expertise in blockchain technology, including experience with smart contract development, gives me a deep understanding of the underlying technology and its potential applications.
In addition to my technical skills, I am also passionate about community building and engagement. I believe that a strong community is essential to the success of any decentralized network. I have experience organizing and participating in community events, and I am committed to fostering a collaborative and inclusive community on the Arbitrum network.
If selected as a delegate, I would work diligently to represent the interests of the community and promote the growth and adoption of the network. I believe that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for this position, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the future of decentralized finance on the Arbitrum network.
Thank you for considering my application.

Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

The goal of a DAO is improving participation and sharing value for users.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Regarding the voting issue, it appears that the proposal has some controversial aspects related to the centralization of power and the favoritism towards one service provider. Therefore, it is important to carefully analyze the proposal and its potential implications before making a decision. Some factors that could be considered include:
The benefits of using Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties.
The potential risks associated with giving too much control to Flipside.
The fairness and inclusiveness of the allocation and oversight committees.
The involvement of other analytics service providers in the proposal.
The concerns raised by Dune and Leshner and their potential validity.
If after careful consideration, you decide to vote against the proposal, you could suggest some amendments that could address the concerns raised. For example, you could propose to reduce the power of Flipside on the committees or to involve other analytics service providers in the proposal.
Regarding the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, it is important to strike a balance between efficiency and decentralization. While centralized decision-making can be more efficient, it can also lead to biases and favoritism. On the other hand, decentralized decision-making can be more fair and inclusive, but it can also be slower and less efficient. Therefore, it is important to weigh the pros and cons of each approach and find a solution that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the risks.

Against
No amendments, just cancel it altogether.
The solution is reputation system, which solves most if not all DAO participation and token-weight voting problems.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
It depends on how the exploit happened. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, then I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no.
The solution to this case is to have each featured delegate disclose any potential conflicts of interest that they may have in advance of participating in the governance process. This disclosure should include any financial, personal, or professional relationships that could potentially influence their decision-making.
Once these disclosures are made, the community can evaluate them and determine whether any conflicts of interest are significant enough to preclude a delegate from participating in the governance process. If a conflict of interest is identified, the delegate should recuse themselves from any decision-making related to that issue.
It’s also important to establish clear guidelines and procedures for addressing conflicts of interest and ensuring that all delegates are acting in the best interest of advancing the Arbitrum ecosystem. This may include regular training and education for delegates, as well as ongoing monitoring and oversight to prevent any conflicts of interest from arising in the first place.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

Improving Governance participation

Overall goals for the DAO: I believe the DAO should strike a balance between being aggressive and conservative in liquidity mining, focusing on long-term sustainability and growth. The primary goal of the DAO should be to foster innovation and collaboration, ensuring a thriving and inclusive ecosystem for all stakeholders.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Vote: Against
Amendments: I would suggest reevaluating the committee seat allocation to give other analytics service providers a fair chance to participate. Additionally, I would propose establishing clear guidelines for decision-making and greater transparency in the allocation process.
Tradeoff approach: Finding the right balance between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is crucial. I would advocate for a more diverse committee and a system of checks and balances, promoting both efficiency and decentralized decision-making.

Sample Voting Issue 2:

Handling the situation: Split Reimbursement. I believe that reimbursing a portion of the losses would demonstrate support for the affected parties while also emphasizing the importance of individual responsibility in a decentralized ecosystem.
Instances for refund: In my opinion, reimbursements should be considered when a project’s negligence or malicious intent has led to significant community impact. However, minor losses or user errors should not warrant reimbursements, as this would encourage complacency and moral hazard.

Languages I speak and write: English, Spanish
Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest: I would like to express my commitment to acting in the best interests of the Arbitrum ecosystem. I confirm that I do not have any conflicts of interest that could compromise my judgment or decision-making on behalf of the community. I am dedicated to contributing my experience and knowledge to create a more decentralized and thriving environment for all stakeholders involved.",227

Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO:
I believe that the overall goals of a DAO should prioritize decentralization, transparency, and inclusiveness in decision-making to ensure that the community’s views are represented. I recognize the importance of Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum’s adoption and advocate for the DAO to support and invest in such solutions. This is why in my opinion, funding public goods initiatives is crucial to accelerate the development of the ecosystem, as seen through the positive impact of the Optimism Grants.

Sample Voting Issue 1
How would you vote?
I would like to provide additional information for readers here in Arbitrum forum about this proposal, as I believe that the description on the first comment in this thread lacks information. In the Flipside<>Uniswap proposal, the Flipside team was asking that:

A grant of 25M $UNI was given to them so they can LP to the univ3 WETH-UNI pool and generate fees. They would not own these funds, they would just manage them.
They wanted to split LP fees (estimated in 30% APR) 50% to Flipside for managing the position and creating analytics for uniswap, and 50% to fund “bounties” that would onboard new users to Uniswap. The idea was to capture more users and bring them to the Uniswap ecosystem.
They proposed the creation of 2 committees to do this, as the original comment describes. In both committees, Flipside would have participation.

I would have voted no to this proposal. Reasons:

There is a conflict of interest between the committees managing this grant and paying themselves a share to fund their operations
50% of management fees seem excessive
The 30% estimated APR was not clearly explained, and some comments suggested it was not conservative. A good idea would be that they include their models so that people can reproduce them

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Their idea of using Uniswap’s treasury to generate fees and then use those fees to fund operations was very good to me. The issue I would have had was with the relationship between the vendor being contracted (Flipside), the manager of the funds and yield strategy (Flipside) and the company that had the most share of decision power in the committees (Flipside). I would start here when thinking of a change to be proposed moving forward.
No one can deny the value that something like CEA (Community-Enabled Analytics) (which is what they were proposing to build) would have had in the Uniswap ecosystem, as many people would find it extremely useful. But there were many potential service providers to be considered, and this was unaccounted for when drafting this proposal.
I also noticed that universities such as the MIT and Upenn voted yes, and apparently they would be getting seats in the committee. In my opinion, this does not look good, at all. The proposal said that the committee would have “2 Individuals from University Blockchain Orgs. To be Identified and Announced Post On-Chain Vote so as to not influence voting.” It seems they voted yes, as it can be seen on-chain.


Sample Voting Issue 2:
Regarding the RARI hack, it’s a complex situation. On the one hand, if a DAO has a sufficient treasury to cover losses from a hack (outside of their own tokens) I would vote immediately in favour to reimbursements. If the DAO has only its own governance tokens, a question might arise: why should holders of the token be punished in the expense of people providing liquidity? Since distributing governance tokens as a reimbursement would most definitively cause sell pressure, this could be seen as going against the interest of token holders. However, another person might answer that the tokens and token holders are directly tied to the protocol, and if the protocol suffers a hack, it’s inevitable that token price will be impacted, one way or another.
In this case, there were many DAOs involved that had a claim on the FEI being distributed. For example, Olympus Finance had a 9M FEI claim on this, FRAX had 12.M. It is also possible that DAOs working together could reach a potential better solution since there’s more ammunition to work with.
My priority when deciding the outcome of this proposal would be to use and deplete as much as possible DAO funds that don’t impact token price first. Then, move with governance tokens and partially team allocations - and try to reach a solution amongst everyone. Regardless, this was an extremely complex situation and there was, in my opinion, not  a right or wrong answer. There were many interests involved.
One thing that I am certain of is that I would have considered and researched every interest to the full extent of my capabilities, to try and seek the best solution to cast my vote. Best as in the one that have the most positive impact in the most people possible.

One of the key benefits of DAOs is that they can be designed to operate without the need for traditional hierarchical structures or centralized control. This means that decisions can be made by a community of stakeholders who are all invested in the success of the project.
As a user and delegator , there are a few ways how I can help improve the effectiveness of DAOs. One way is to participate actively in the decision-making process by voting on proposals and providing feedback. Additionally, you can contribute to the development and growth of the project by offering your skills and expertise.

A mineração de liquidez é uma estratégia popular usada pelos DAOs para incentivar os provedores de liquidez e recompensar os membros da comunidade por contribuírem para a plataforma. A agressividade da mineração de liquidez pode depender dos objetivos e da tolerância a riscos de um DAO. Uma abordagem mais agressiva à mineração de liquidez pode levar a um crescimento mais rápido, mas também pode aumentar a volatilidade e o risco.
Questões anteriores levantadas em outras comunidades podem variar amplamente, mas algumas comuns incluem preocupações sobre transparência, governança e segurança. Os DAOs podem resolver esses problemas implementando processos transparentes de tomada de decisão, fortes protocolos de segurança e estruturas de governança orientadas pela comunidade.
No geral, os objetivos de um DAO e a abordagem da mineração de liquidez devem estar alinhados com as necessidades e prioridades de sua comunidade. Os DAOs podem se beneficiar da incorporação de feedback e contribuições dos membros da comunidade para garantir que suas estratégias e objetivos reflitam os valores e interesses do ecossistema mais amplo.

In general, the overall goals of a DAO may vary depending on the DAO’s particular mission and objectives. Some DAOs may focus on community building, while others may prioritize decentralization, innovation, or financial gains.
Regarding liquidity mining, the DAO may want to consider the potential benefits and risks associated with such programs. Liquidity mining can be an effective way to incentivize participation and encourage liquidity provision, but it may also result in market distortions, concentration of power, and potential regulatory scrutiny. As such, the DAO may want to take a measured and strategic approach to liquidity mining, considering the costs and benefits of such programs and aligning them with the DAO’s overall objectives.
Ultimately, the goal of the DAO should be to maximize the value and benefits for its stakeholders while adhering to its core values and principles. By fostering a culture of transparency, participation, and accountability, the DAO can empower its members to work collaboratively and make informed decisions that align with the DAO’s long-term interests.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The goals of Arbitrum DAO should be geared towards enabling communities and DAOs building on Arbitrum to achieve their goals while providing the best support we can as a DAO. This includes using the DAO’s resources to onboard and support new projects both in terms of technical development as well as onboarding communities, bring greater visibility for existing projects and also create incentives for P2P networks to thrive in a self sustained economy without using centralized entities like exchanges.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 
My Answers:

How would you vote?
I would vote FOR the proposal as even though it brings about some degree of centralization of power, ultimately Flipside would help Uniswap achieve the goal of attracting new users. Moreover, the vote doesnt preclude other participants from obtaining their own share of bounties to further the same goal.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would propose a similar vote with other parties who are able to bring new users to also access similar bounties.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
In my view, the ability to get things done matters more to early stage DAOs, as often times things get stuck in a loop of repetitive debates for a long time, while the immediate objectives and goals of the proposal take a back seat. While network level decentralization is ultimately very important, in terms of execution there can be some leeway so as enable greater execution.

In this situation, there are multiple parties which share the responsibilities for the loss of funds, hence a split re-imbursement will be ideal
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
I believe it would be right for a DAO to refund victims of a hack if there is wide consensus that the DAO was responsible in some part for the loss of funds. In many situations, it is not possible for the DAO to refund, however to the extent it is financially possible, and a solution can be achieved that takes into account the considerations of all the parties, all the parties must strive towards bringing such a proposal to fruition.

Anyone with more then 10 ARB will be able vote but it will has a impact of 1. Well whales could spread 10 ARB to thousands of wallets but it will cost them least 0.20¢ each transaction.
I think main usage for the ARB token should be to decentralize the rollup. As you can agree Arbitrum right now is somewhat centralized. I am not a tech person but as i have read Sequencer could be decentralized with token (by giving the person running an sequencer small ARB rewards). Overall giving everyone the power of being in the Arbitrum Security Council is cool.
• Uniswap - Flipside
I would be against for this proposal. First of all giving all power to one analytics provider seems very centralized. This is like projects using CMC api instead of Chainlink oracles. Secondly the UNI allocation seems much to me.
By the way i just remembered something from 2021. Uniswap gave an grant to a project called DeFi Education Fund 20 million dollars. They were supposed to educate, introduce, teach people about defi. https://twitter.com/fund_defi/status/1414704889897394178?t=M6N6c1fCItezdMH0g5s3AA&s=19
Funny thing they have been allocated for 5 years but they instantly dumped all the UNI’s. 1 year has passed and i have not heard of them not even a single time. I’m browsing CT everyday. Similar with Flipside situation an university voted with 10 million tokens for their own good.
•What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I really cant tell much about this question. I am not into DeFi analyzing tools like nansen ai or dune nor know how much bounty they need.
•How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Decentralization is the only way.
• FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement
•Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Whole situation seems very compilacted as it impacted both individual victims and DAO’s. I think giving individuals FEI and giving DAO’s DAI looks very unfair. There shouldnt be a split. Also I’m not a fan of giving small balance victims more and whales less. Everyone should get their payback equal.

Im most interested in NFT development on Arbitrum.
Im not the biggest fan of liquidity mining, at least not directly from a DAO. I think that in the best of many cases the best is to apply to different protocols that kind of incentives, maybe like Optimism that brought diverse uses to its network incentivizing it in an indirect way in usability and ecosystem.


Against.
2.Nothing more.
3.The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a common challenge for any organization, including DAOs. On one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear leadership and decision-making, leading to faster execution and more efficient use of resources. On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision-making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of the wider community.


Full Reimbursement.

Stance on overall goals for the DAO
Our overall goals for the DAO are to create a thriving developer ecosystem, innovate mechanisms for coordination and drive sustainable user growth. As a delegate, we are committed to transparency and inclusivity and will ensure that the community’s interests are best represented so that the DAO continues to thrive in the long term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
We would be against this issue. It puts too much power and trust in the hands of Flipside. The incentives are poorly aligned as they would be borrowing $25m to generate yield for their own purpose, taking a 0% to 50% cut of fees from that.
While community-enabled analytics is a good idea, the community has already proven that it can achieve similar levels of impact with far less draw down from the treasury. As an example, in April 2021, Flipside built the Uniswap V3 Calculator - driving user growth and activity for Uniswap for only $25k.
Furthermore, the management of funds to generate yield, and the use of funds for community purposes should not be mixed together within one proposal. The proposal should be amended by a simple request of funds for their purpose and to a much lesser amount <US $100K with periodic reviews.
The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done should be managed by enabling low-risk initiatives more freedom and looser management, but with structures in place for periodic check-ins e.g. bi-monthly meetings for community review. This allows the community to move fast, while also ensuring that it is moving in the right direction.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
We believe that no reimbursements should be made. While making innocent users whole is important, the cost of reimbursements is likely to significantly drain a DAO’s treasury or even be insufficient for full reimbursement. The funds should instead be proactively used for more extensive audits or possibly to purchase limited insurance for smaller depositors.

NFT development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participating

Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a potential representative of the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to facilitate the growth and development of the community while ensuring the representation of the interests of all members. To achieve this goal, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that promote liquidity and encourage the participation of different stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool to incentivize participation and establish momentum, I believe that we should approach it with caution and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can withstand market fluctuations and adapt to evolving conditions.
Regarding issues raised by other communities, I believe that it is important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to problem-solving and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can foster a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits all stakeholders.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible management of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a representative, I will strive to ensure that the interests of the community are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow in the long term.

Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty


For


To address concerns about centralization of power, the DAO could adjust the composition of committees or establish clear criteria for decision-making. This could involve reducing Flipside’s seats or including other providers. Additionally, criteria for allocation could be established and reporting or an independent oversight committee could be required. The goal of any amendments should be to promote transparency, fairness, and inclusivity while ensuring the program’s effectiveness.


To balance the need for efficient decision-making with the risk of centralization of power, a DAO should establish clear guidelines and processes for decision-making, while ensuring that power is distributed fairly. This can be achieved by promoting transparency, fairness, and inclusivity in decision-making and encouraging diverse participation. It’s important to have independent oversight committees or regular reporting and auditing of decision-making processes to minimize the risk of centralization. Ultimately, finding the right balance will depend on the specific context and goals of the DAO.


Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
The decision to reimburse parties affected by an exploit would depend on the specific circumstances of the case, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on affected parties, and the financial impact on the DAO or other entities involved. In some cases, a full reimbursement may be warranted if the exploit caused significant harm and the affected parties can demonstrate that they acted in good faith and followed established procedures.
In other cases, a split reimbursement or no reimbursement may be more appropriate, particularly if the affected parties were aware of the risks and took actions that exacerbated the impact of the exploit. The decision would need to balance the needs of affected parties with the long-term financial sustainability and viability of the DAO or other entities involved.
Ultimately, the decision to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made through a transparent and accountable process that involves input from all relevant stakeholders, including affected parties, DAO members, and the wider community. This would help to ensure that the decision is based on a full understanding of the circumstances and is aligned with the values and goals of the DAO or other entities involved.

As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation.

I have a keen interest in Public Goods Funding, DeFi development, and Tools for gathering data. Regarding liquidity incentives, I think incentives should be use for introduce new platforms to newcomers while also imposing limits on bigger capitals. I believe that the ArbitrumDao should use incentives to promote awareness of Arbitrum-based dApps, and as a result, capital will naturally move in.
Regarding the sample issue, I vote against it. Instead, I suggest improving the proposal by adding solid milestones to the process and transferring an initial amount to Flipside after each milestone is achieved, followed by subsequent portions. This way, we can strike a balance between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done.

It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
However, in general, it is important to consider the balance between centralization and efficiency when making decisions. While centralization can enable faster decision-making, it can also lead to power imbalances and decreased community participation. Therefore, any amendments to the proposal should prioritize increasing transparency and community involvement while still allowing for efficient implementation.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
It would depend on the specific circumstances of the hack and the impact on the affected parties. In general, it is important to balance the needs of the affected parties with the overall health and sustainability of the project. Full reimbursement may not always be feasible or sustainable, but partial reimbursement or other forms of compensation may be appropriate in certain cases. Ultimately, any decision should be made with transparency and community input to ensure fairness and accountability.

Gaming development on Arbitrum
Supporting Infrastructure

Regarding the overall goals of the DAO, it depends on the DAO’s specific objectives and priorities. Still, generally speaking, the primary goal of a DAO is to enable decentralized decision-making and collective ownership, where members can participate in decision-making processes and have a say in how the DAO operates.
Regarding liquidity mining, the aggressiveness of the strategy will depend on the DAO’s resources, objectives, and risk tolerance. Liquidity mining can be an effective way to incentivize users to provide liquidity to the DAO’s pools, but it also carries risks, such as impermanent loss and volatility.
Regarding the voting issue, if I were a member of the DAO, I would consider the potential risks and benefits of the proposal and vote accordingly. If I believed that the proposal would benefit the DAO and its users, I would vote for it. Still, if I had concerns about the centralization of power and the favoring of one service provider over others, I would vote against it or propose amendments to address these concerns.
Regarding amendments to the proposal, I would suggest reducing the amount of control given to Flipside and increasing the involvement of other analytics service providers. For example, instead of having Flipside control the allocation committee, the DAO could establish a more decentralized approach that involves multiple service providers.
Regarding the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, it’s essential to find a balance that ensures effective decision-making without compromising the DAO’s decentralized structure. One approach is to distribute decision-making power among multiple stakeholders and establish clear guidelines and processes for decision-making. Additionally, transparency and accountability are crucial to ensure that all members have a say in how the DAO operates.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, has a fundamental purpose: to foster the healthy and decentralized development of the rollup. This encompasses a variety of aspects, ranging from technical and security-focused sections of the rollup, which the DAO should oversee, to promoting the growth of a healthy ecosystem and ARB token.
In essence, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: how does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not only the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?
With this guiding principle, the DAO can explore different roles it could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem. However, this requires careful decision-making and balancing the interests of all stakeholders. Some examples include technical protocol and security upgrades, liquidity mining, and grants for builders.
In terms of technical protocol and security upgrades, the DAO must have oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. One potential solution is to establish a technical subcommittee that oversees this side of governance and reports back to the wider DAO.
Liquidity mining can assist with short-term growth and user acquisition, but it should not be a permanent fixture of any protocol. Subsidizing protocols for too long through unsustainable emissions could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols.
Finally, grants are a crucial part of the DAO that target builders. Grants must be handled carefully and require a degree of social trust from both the DAO and the builders. Builders must demonstrate accountability and deliverables for the amount of the grant.
In summary, the DAO’s mission is to ensure the long-term sustainability and success of the ARB token and the broader future of rollups. By carefully balancing the interests of stakeholders and exploring different roles, the DAO can achieve this mission and contribute to the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
I would vote in favor of the proposal due to the necessity of delegation of voting power for efficient functioning of a DAO. However, I would suggest making some amendments to the proposal.
Firstly, I would recommend separating the grants into quarterly distributions instead of just dividing it into Year 1 and Year 2, as it would be more practical to have routine votes to ensure the DAO’s comfort with such a large allocation.
Secondly, I would suggest introducing checkpoints across the delegation period to encourage the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.
When considering the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, I believe that it is necessary for a DAO to have centralizing points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, and the entities to do this should be trusted members of the space. While centralization brings a degree of centralization, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and there are sufficient accountability measures in place, it can be a useful tool for the development of the DAO.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
I would choose to handle the situation by offering a partial reimbursement. Hacks and loss of funds remain significant obstacles to the adoption of blockchain technology, and they threaten the concept of financial legos, making it more difficult for new users to join the space. As such, it is essential to consider providing some form of reimbursement to parties who have entrusted the security of their smart contracts to the protocol. This could be seen as a way of expressing gratitude for their trust and dedication.
However, I would advise against offering a full reimbursement, particularly if the hack has already caused significant damage to the protocol. In such cases, a full reimbursement could lead to a negative death spiral for the DAO, which could be just as catastrophic as a second hack. Instead, it would be better to provide enough compensation to acknowledge the participants’ involvement in the system while also ensuring that the impact of the hack is not worsened.
To summarize, it is appropriate to provide some form of reimbursement in instances where parties have cooperated with the protocol, but a full reimbursement should be avoided if it would negatively affect the DAO. In the future, DAO insurance protocols could be developed to handle similar situations more effectively.

how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
I believe the goal of the DAO is to create a long-term and sustainable ecosystem of liquidity, users, and value. To this end, we will be aggressive in our liquidity mining initiatives, seeking to maximize the liquidity pool and incentivize users to participate in the network. We  ould also  also use liquidity mining to increase the overall value of the network, ensuring that the DAO is able to grow over time. We will ensure that rewards are distributed fairly and responsibly, and that liquidity mining does not become a source of inflation nor a dependency.

3.The goal of the DAO is to strike a balance between the need for centralization of authority and the need to accommodate innovative ideas and diverse perspectives. We will strive to create an environment that allows for efficient decision-making while still facilitating collaboration, creativity, and participation.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 
Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee.

Improving Governance participation
Overall goal for the DAO -
Create a DAO that is not based based on how rich the person is.  Governance should be quadratic voting (per Vitalik Buterin) mixed with constant vigilance on preventing sybilliism.  Much DAO funding should go toward implementing quadratic voting and Dapps/projects that detect and slash sybil methods of gaming the system.
Sample Voting Issue 1 -

Against
Get rid of this part: “However, the remaining half of the grant would go completely to Flipside to run the program, including full salaries for seven staff members and partial salaries for another seven. It would then use the yield earned via the program to keep funding itself. Essentially, Flipside would leverage the Uniswap governance process to become the protocol’s official service provider of continuing education—and get paid for it.  Moreover, the seven-member allocation committee, charged with generating a 30% return on the provided funds, and the three-member oversight committee, responsible for voting on whether the program should continue into a second year, both featured representation from Flipside, but no other analytics firms. If Flipside representatives voted as a block in either committee, they’d need only to convince one other member to vote alongside them in order to get their way.” $25 Million Uniswap Proposal Draws Ire of Crypto Community - Decrypt

Term Limits / limit votes on issues with egregious personal benefit.  Make any tradeoff for centralization temporary and make sure that authority does not also include the ability to make their authority permanent.  Also if Flipside were given enough UNI to vote in their own favor on all matters, then make their vote invalid/weakened for anything in their favor.  For example, a16z should not be allowed to vote on making Celo a chain supported by Uniswap–at least not with it’s entire stack (and again, Uniswap does not do quadratic voting, and it may be too late to put it in place).  Celo had/has a tiny TVL and should not be the next chain Uniswap added when it did.  Could a16z do some backroom shenanigans, convince others to vote, move their UNI around, sure…  But a16z would likely draw attention to itself and a bad reputation worse than any benefit of adding Celo to Uniswap.  Further, if tools were made ahead of time to prevent sybillism and quadratic voting, then a16z wouldn’t (ideally) even attempt it.

Sample voting issue 2 - reimbursement:

It could be 1, 2, or 3 but taken on a case by case basis.  If a DeFi dapp followed best practices and got exploited, then they may deserve 1, but that burden is high.  For me: 1) very good bug bounty (e.g. immueifi for $1 million for critical, or more), 2) white hat protection if they follow proper white hat methods (e.g. jump crypto suggests Whitehats and Dropboxes but there are probably others), 3) Audits by quality auditors, 4) Audits on all upgrades too (this is going to be more expensive, and make the Dapp less agile, but so many exploits happen because they got audited and passed, but then did an upgrade with only a weak internal audit, or none at all–there may be exceptions, but need to be taken case by case), 5) Keeping on top of all forks that might have gotten exploited and/or exploits that could be used on them (e.g. Euler got hit with something that happened to EPMAX a month before, perhaps it was a trial run, considering their size/TVL should they have dedicated resources to look for any attack that could be used on them or by a fork?  Do not know if EPMAX was a fork, but if so…).  Those are just the top 5 I can think of.  There are probably lots more.  But that’s how it should be determined.  If due diligence is performed, and no one could see it coming, well, yeah, if you can afford it, and you should be the team to do it, then do it.  I have no idea if Arbitrum foundation is who should do the reimbursement, but I suppose that matters case-by-case.  For example, if Arbitrum’s fraud proofs entered a exploit vector somehow, yeah, Arbitrum should reimburse everyone and anyone that got hit as much as possible.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

3.The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a common challenge for any organization, including DAOs. On one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear leadership and decision-making, leading to faster execution and more efficient use of resources. On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision-making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of the wider community.

Position on DAO goals: My position on DAO is positive because it allows users to propose and vote on what they want. DAO also gives users the ability to either reject or approve proposals made by anyone. This means more power is given to the users rather than just a centralized group of individuals.
Sample Voting1:
Vote: For Amendments: I would propose that too much power should not be given to a single entity. Rather, there should be a basic limit as to the governance power an organization should have. Tradeoff Approach: I believe there should be decentralization in authority because it gives room for flexibility, creativity, and innovation.
Sample Voting2:
Split Reimbursement: I believe split reimbursement is a better approach as it shows that the organization values its users, as well as maintains a stable financial situation in its business, and this could restore trust and have a minimal effect on their business.

● In what area do I most want to contribute?
 - Financing of public goods
 - Improve participation in governance
● My position on the general objectives of the DAO:
I am convinced that the financing of public goods is generally undervalued in terms of financing, although this is an important point that should not be overlooked.
It is clear that public goods are indispensable resources that must be considered in proportion to what they bring in terms of value as well as for their roles played in the growth of the ecosystem.
In this sense, I think it is therefore imperative to create incentive solutions that would make it possible to reward public goods at their fair value and I think that the Arbitrum foundation is capable of enabling this mission to be accomplished in the general interest.
● MY ANALYSYS ON VOTING PROBLEM 1:

QUESTION 1: How would you vote?

Regarding Uniswap’s proposal to use Flipside to attract new users via bounties, it is important to consider the pros and cons of the proposal to determine whether one should vote for or against.
Voting FOR, therefore, would mean approving Uniswap’s proposal to use Flipside to attract new users.
Benefits of this approach include the ability to attract new users and expand Uniswap’s user base.
To vote AGAINST would be to reject Uniswap’s proposal to use Flipside to attract new users.
The disadvantages of this approach include the centralization of power and the favor of a single service provider.
Additionally, the allocation of seats on the Allocations and Oversight Committee gives Flipside disproportionate control over the program, which may worry some community members.
Finally, the fact that other analytics service providers are not involved in the proposal can be seen as a disadvantage, as it may reduce diversity and competition in the analytics services market.
● CONCLUSION
Ultimately, the choice to vote FOR or AGAINST will depend on the individual priorities of each member of the Uniswap community.
If increasing the number of users is considered the top priority, then a vote FOR may be warranted.
However, if decentralization of power and diversity of analytics service providers are considered more important, an AGAINST vote may be warranted.
● MY PERSONAL CHOICE
I will have voted AGAINST this proposal, which does not correspond to my way of seeing governance.

QUESTION 2: What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

To this question, I will answer that I will ask for the establishment of a counter proposal in order to maintain the initial proposal by simply reducing control over the allocation of UNI to premiums and monitoring of the entire program.

QUESTION 3: How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

This is both an interesting question and a complicated problem to solve…
To address this trade-off, it is important to understand that centralization and decentralization are not mutually exclusive approaches. In reality, it is often necessary to find a balance between these two approaches to achieve optimal results.
Ultimately, the trade-off between centralization and decentralization will depend on the organization’s goals and the specific circumstances of each situation. It is important to tailor approaches as needed and find a balance that maximizes the benefits of each approach while minimizing the drawbacks.
● My approaches would be:
 - Clearly define roles and responsibilities, in order to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings.
 - Foster collaboration in a decentralized way that gives individuals and groups more freedom to experiment and come up with new ideas.
 - Promote the participation of all members of the organization in the decision-making process in order to help generate a feeling of belonging and responsibility, and to obtain a consensus around the decisions made.
● MY ANALYSYS ON VOTING PROBLEM 2:
When it comes to refunding the Rari hack, it is important to consider the specific circumstances of the incident as well as the implications of any refund decision.
The three possible options to handle this situation are: full refund, no refund and split refund.
 - FULL REIMBURSEMENT:
If the full refund option is chosen, it means that all parties that were affected by the hack would be refunded in full.
This option can be considered the fairest, as the affected parties have not chosen to suffer losses due to a criminal act.
However, it can also be costly for the organization and could potentially encourage irresponsible behavior on the part of users in the future, knowing that they will be reimbursed in the event of a hack.
 - NO REIMBURSEMENT:
The option of not reimbursing affected parties can be considered the fairest for the organization, as it does not bear the costs of losses incurred by users.
However, it can also lead to a loss of user confidence in the organization and therefore a loss of value for the whole system.
 - SPLIT REIMBURSEMENT:
The option of partially reimbursing affected parties can be seen as an interim solution, which can be fair to affected parties while limiting costs to the organization.
This option can also encourage users to be more careful in their use of the platform, knowing that they will not be fully reimbursed in the event of a hack.
● CONCLUSION
Ultimately, choosing the best option will depend on the specific circumstances of the incident, as well as the long-term goals of the organization.
If the organization wants to maintain the trust of its users, full refund might be considered the best option. However, if the organization is looking to contain costs while addressing user concerns, a split reimbursement might be a better option.
In all cases, it is important to clearly communicate the reasons for the decision taken and to work with the affected parties to find a solution that is fair and acceptable to all.
● MY PERSONAL CHOICE:
I will therefore opt for the split reimbursement, but only, if the funds of the project allow it.
● LANGUAGES THAT I SPEAK AND WRITE:
French, Chinese English, Spanish.
● STATEMENT OF NO CONFLICT(S) OF INTEREST:

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Supporting Infrastructure

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
My goals would be to see aggressive pushes for TVL growth via user adoption via DEFI and NFT platforms. DEXs are the way to go but at the same time, there should be openness about who can create and what that criteria is. Giving people more access to on/off ramping solutions as well as bridging solutions. Projects should become the central hub for all things so that their community does not have to go to 20 different sites to get one thing done from the main site. Bridging projects behind the scenes can be key in this. Open communication with the community as well as working to get new users onboarded. Looking at making it a chain that is made for every person not just towards whales and those with big plays. But for any participant.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
[Issue Overview ]

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?

Against. It has been proven time and again that when too many have power it gets abused and the ‘old-way’ of thinking comes forward again, back-room deals, payouts without bidding, going for the lowest bid that ends being the worst as well.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

If there had been a phase out so that the structure could have been provided and roadmap had been clear then new people could have shared in the responsibility of keeping the bounties going without a centralization of power. The other downside of a centralization is that it then becomes a target.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

Allowed for a transition to happen, yes it was Flipside providing the road map but then at the same time once it was set flipside could slowly give up seats so that it knew that it would not get abused as well.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Issue Overview:
FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
If it is the tech that caused the hack then it should be on the builders that committed the push. That being said not all things can be accounted for. But there should be audits done in the beginning before going live and then there should be on-going bounties to find new weaknesses. The part is that it should be on the security company that performs the audit, that way they are held accountable to the work they do as well. There should be a level of trust from all parties, that good code is put forth, and that the code is safe for people to use.
I would have voted for split reimbursement so that those that dropped the ball could work to fix their mistakes and learn, but that at the same time be held accountable and work to make users whole, it should not be on one project unless it is one project responsilble.
3. Split Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
If a project or protocol puts out bad code then it is on them, if a user clicks on a bad link and does not do their own research then the responsibility should be on them. But at the same time projects should be proactive in protecting their users and making sure that the highest of standards are used and if there is a warning cry then it should be taken as serious as the person making the claim, so there should be avenues for both reporting and investigating claims.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

How would you vote?
I would vote against because giving too much control to a single provider could create conflicts of interest and undermine the DAO’s commitment to decentralization. In the long run, transparency and accountability in the program’s reporting and evaluation should be prioritized.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
It would be appropriate to structure a clear guidelines and criteria for determining allocations.
This would help prevent any conflicts of interest or biases from arising and ensure that the it is fair and transparent.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Regarding the tradeoff between centralization and efficiency, I believe that the decentralization should be prioritize as a fundamental principle. However, some level of centralization or a push may be necessary to achieve certain goals or mitigate risks. Therefore, I would advocate for a balanced approach that ensures sufficient checks and balances and prevents any single entity from gaining too much control.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

I believe that parties affected by an exploit should be reimbursed, to the extent that the DAO’s resources allow for it. However, I also think that the DAO should carefully evaluate each case considering factors such as the severity of the exploit, the impact on the affected parties, and the overall impact on the DAO’s reputation and ecosystem. We should prioritize fairness, transparency, and responsibility in handling situations like this, while also being mindful of its financial sustainability and broader impact on the ecosystem.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The overall goal of a DAO is to create a decentralized and democratic organization that is managed by its members through a set of rules encoded on a blockchain. The purpose of a DAO is to provide a more transparent and secure way for people to collaborate and make decisions without the need for intermediaries or third parties. DAOs can be used for various purposes, such as funding, investing, charity, or governance. The ultimate goal of a DAO is to create a fair and efficient system that benefits all its members and encourages participation and innovation. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining depends on the goals and risk tolerance of the DAO. Liquidity mining is a process of incentivizing users to provide liquidity to a decentralized exchange or a liquidity pool by rewarding them with tokens. The goal of liquidity mining is to increase the liquidity of a particular token or asset and to encourage trading activity, which can result in a higher demand and price for the token. However, liquidity mining also involves risks, such as impermanent loss and market volatility, which can affect the profitability of the DAO.
The goal of the DAO should be to balance the benefits and risks of liquidity mining and to ensure that the rewards are distributed fairly and transparently among its members. The DAO should also consider the long-term sustainability and growth of the ecosystem and the impact of liquidity mining on the token price and the overall market. Therefore, the aggressiveness of liquidity mining should be based on a careful analysis of market conditions, user behavior, and the objectives of the DAO.

For
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Regarding the proposed Flipside program, it is understandable that there were concerns about the level of control and influence that Flipside would have over the allocation of UNI bounties and the oversight of the program. The fact that Flipside had a significant representation on the allocation and oversight committees could suggest a potential conflict of interest, and the lack of involvement of other analytics service providers could raise questions about fairness and competition.

If I were to consider amendments to the proposal, I would suggest reducing Flipside’s representation on the committees to ensure a more equitable distribution of power and oversight. Additionally, I would recommend involving other analytics service providers to promote competition and ensure that multiple perspectives and expertise are taken into account in the allocation and oversight of the program. It is also essential to ensure that the program is transparent, fair, and democratic, and that all stakeholders have a chance to participate and provide their input.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex issue that requires a careful balance between efficiency and democracy. Centralization of authority can lead to faster decision-making and implementation of projects, but it can also create power imbalances, lack of transparency, and resistance to change. On the other hand, decentralization can lead to more democratic decision-making and community involvement, but it can also result in slower decision-making and coordination, especially in larger groups.

To approach this tradeoff, it is important to consider the specific needs and goals of the organization, as well as the preferences and values of its members. It may be helpful to establish clear guidelines and procedures for decision-making, to delegate authority to different levels of the organization based on the complexity and scope of the task, and to encourage open communication and feedback among members. It is also important to regularly evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision-making process and to make adjustments as needed.
Ultimately, the approach to the tradeoff between centralization and decentralization should be based on a careful consideration of the benefits and drawbacks of each approach, and a commitment to creating a fair and sustainable system that serves the needs and interests of all members

Prompts to Answer:

i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

Split Reimbursement
The decision to reimburse parties affected by an exploit depends on several factors, including the nature and severity of the exploit, the extent of the damage caused, and the capacity of the project or organization to cover the losses. It is also essential to consider the impact of the exploit on the broader community, including the reputation and trust of the project or organization.

In general, if the exploit was due to a vulnerability or flaw in the system or contract code that was beyond the control of the affected parties, it may be appropriate to consider some form of reimbursement as a gesture of goodwill and to maintain trust in the system. However, if the exploit was due to negligence, malicious intent or lack of due diligence on the part of the affected parties, reimbursement may not be appropriate.
In cases where reimbursement is deemed appropriate, there are different ways to approach it, including full reimbursement, partial reimbursement, or a combination of both. It is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each approach and to ensure that the reimbursement process is transparent, fair, and equitable to all affected parties.

I believe that Arbitrum DAO’s biggest goal is to support the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem as best as possible. It can be divided into three objects as follows:


Technical upgrades of the network: I think Arbitrum Nitro is not the most complete version of Arbitrum and in the future there will be many updates to improve the network. Voting for upgrades will be important as it directly concerns the entire community on Arbitrum. Although not all members of the DAO have deep technical knowledge, but with a common user’s point of view, they can completely decide according to their feelings because updates will affect the experience. their experience.


Builders: I know that before, Arbitrum didn’t pay much attention to the ecosystem and allowed everyone to develop the project as they wanted without much intervention or support. Although there have been many innovations such as GMX, JonesDAO, RageTrade,… But if we want to develop a stronger ecosystem, we should have policies and programs to support developers such as grants fund, hackathon, incentive , Technical advice,…


Users: I think the ultimate purpose of a blockchain platform is to give users the best experience, so at the same time as developing the ecosystem, to avoid Arbitrum being hated, I think there is a Council to evaluate and warn projects that are not transparent or exploit users is also a necessity.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
A DAO’s goal is to congeal a community around the core code and distribute value and ownership to engage participants in a way that makes them want to give more of themselves. Liquidity mining is a favorable starting point but must be optimized long-term to limit dilutive distributions. If such mining can land a strategic partner, then this has proven to be an effective use of the tokens being allocated.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

#1: Vote: Against.
Amendments: Disproporate control is de facto control. Partnerships are fine but decentralizing power so someone can’t unilaterally push through a proposal should be avoided at all costs. Decentralization is difficult to execute in practice, but there should be some distribution such that a proposal has to have a protocol politician making their case to the community rather than glad-handing one to two DAO power brokers to push through a proposal that may benefit specific individuals than the overall community.
centralization vs committee problem: Organize specific groups or delegated roles in which key participants will have the power to do their respective tasks but not enough to run wild.

Being hacked represents an unfavorable optic for a company supposed to be technologically sharp, but an even worse optic is not valuing the community. Project principals should absolutely offer coverage to make whole those who were affected even if it comes at the expense of diluting their relative percentage of the project.

The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a common challenge for any organization, including DAOs. On one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear leadership and decision-making, leading to faster execution and more efficient use of resources.

Most interest in Defi Development and Improving Governance participation
The DAO should aim to (in order of priority)

Maximize user participation on governance and educate users about the overall decision-making processes related to the operation and development of Arbitrum
Establish a strong and passionate community in order to create more opportunities for members and developers to collaborate and contribute to the growth of Arbitrum
Incubate new ideas and innovations, particularly in the DeFi space, to enhance user experience aswell as motivate more users (similar to how GMX contributed greatly towards bring more users to arbitrum)
Sample Vote 1:
Against.
Acceptable amendment would be to reduce Flipside control over UNI bounty allocations by allocating them 2/7 seats in allocation committee
Centralization of authority allows for swifter decisions to be conducted, which can be especially useful in high fear situations (eg major crypto market downturn) Despite this, especially for Uniswap. Decentralization is critical for it to function safely and fairly, therefore decentralization is worth the “inability to get things done”
Also must be noted that it is concerning that these university clubs were able to have such an impact on the proposal and Dune and Leshner were correct for speaking up about it

Sample vote 2:
Split Reimbursment
Firstly, Rari was hacked through a reentrancy vulnerability in Rari’s Fuse lending protocol, the same vulnerability used to attack other forks of Compound Defi protocol, therefore the devs are quite responsible for the hack.
Investing in crypto generally, especially through the use of protocols is high risk, and most users are aware of the risks present, and therefore should not expect a DAO to be obliged to reimburse all stolen funds.
Yet, a partial re-imbursment is a correct thing to do in order to support those affected, HOWEVER this should only happen if the DAO is in a solid financial position and the reimbursement will not have a great impact on the DAO.
Speak and write Greek and English
I have been a great supporter of crypto currency for quite a while, and I am soon going to begin studying Psychology in university, and hope to be able to apply psychological principles into both business setting and financial markets. Hence, by becoming a delegate of Arbitrum, I will be able to foster my passion for crypto and how it is affected by psychological principles in a real life setting, as well as providing me the platform to expand and grow my knowledge on the functioning, maintenance and growth of a DAO, information in which will be of great value to me.
I have previously worked in managerial and community positions in NFT projects, and I love interacting with and contributing towards a community in which is like-minded and passionate, and will be ecstatic to be given the opportunity to participate in the growth of Arbitrum amazing community and outstanding DeFi ecosystem",291

DeFi development on Arbitrum


IRL Arbitrum community gatherings


Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The overall goals of a crypto DAO can or may vary depending on the specific context and purpose of the organization. However, here are what I would be looking for possible goals that our Arbitrum’s DAO should or might aim to achieve:
Decentralization: The primary goal of our DAO should be to create a decentralized organization that is governed by its members rather than a centralized authority. This means that decisions should be made democratically through consensus mechanisms and voting processes.
Transparency: Ensure transparency in all its operations, including financial transactions, decision-making processes, and governance structures. This transparency helps build trust and credibility among members and stakeholders.
Community-driven: This would encourage participation from all members and can be achieved through various mechanisms such as community discussions, proposal submissions, and voting processes.
Innovation: We should aim to foster innovation and creativity by providing a platform for members to share their ideas and collaborate on new projects. This can help the organization stay competitive and relevant in the rapidly evolving crypto ecosystem.
Social impact: We could also aim to have a positive social impact by supporting social causes and initiatives. This can be achieved through various means such as charitable donations, community outreach, and educational programs.
Sustainability: Finally, we should aim to achieve long-term sustainability by ensuring the continued growth and success of the organization. This can be achieved by implementing sound financial and governance structures, maintaining a diverse membership base, and adapting to changing market conditions.
These are just some goals that our DAO should have, there are countless more goals we could aim for but for that our, DAO should vote on what is the best course of action for everyone.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
Regarding the vote, it depends on the individual’s priorities and values. If the potential benefits of the proposal outweigh the concerns about centralization of power and favoritism towards one service provider, then one might consider voting in favor of it. On the other hand, if they believe that the risks associated with the proposal are too high, they may vote against it.
I’d vote For
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
If there is a desire to move forward with the proposal, some possible amendments could include reducing Flipside’s control over the allocation and oversight committees, increasing the involvement of other analytics service providers, or adding more checks and balances to ensure fair distribution of bounties.
How would you approach the tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a difficult one to navigate. On one hand, centralization can help streamline decision-making and make it easier to implement initiatives. On the other hand, it can lead to power imbalances, bias, and exclusion. It’s essential to strike a balance between these two considerations and establish safeguards to prevent abuses of power. One possible way to do this is to include a diverse group of stakeholders in decision-making processes and provide transparency and accountability measures.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reimbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Regarding the question of whether parties should be reimbursed for an exploit or not, there are different factors to consider. In general, if the DAO has the resources and the capability to reimburse those affected, it may be the right thing to do. This would help to rebuild trust and confidence in the platform and ensure that users are not unfairly penalized for vulnerabilities that are beyond their control.
That being said, there are also cases where reimbursement may not be appropriate. For instance, if the affected parties were complicit in the exploit or if they failed to take adequate measures to secure their assets, then it may not be fair to reimburse them.
As for the specific options of full reimbursement, no reimbursement, or split reimbursement, each has its own pros and cons. Full reimbursement would provide the most comprehensive support to those affected, but it may also place a heavy financial burden on the DAO. No reimbursement may be the most cost-effective solution, but it could damage the reputation of the DAO and discourage future users from joining. Split reimbursement, where only a portion of the losses is reimbursed, could strike a balance between these two considerations.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a careful evaluation of the circumstances and the values of the DAO. It is important to consider the impact on affected users, the financial implications for the DAO, and the potential consequences for the platform’s reputation and long-term viability.
In my opinion, a Split Reimbursement with all that it entails would be my vote for this case.
TL;DR Compensate enough to thank the participants for being part of the system and demonstrate how sorry we feel for their loss. A full reimbursement might help these stakeholders more but the impact of this decision could lead the DAO to enter a death spiral which would be almost impossible to get out of.

I have been through many black swan events + hacks through my crypto journey and though I know what I want and need in those moments from the projects/protocols or financial institutions in order for me to walk away happy, it almost never happens and I walk away reluctantly. I know that that is the way it should be, otherwise, the project and the team would simply have to compensate users out of their pocket. What happened was not my fault, nor their fault so it is unfair for everyone but that is how life is in general.
I am fully aware of this type of situation and how to best handle them in order for the DAO to survive this kind of attack. My mindset would be always to safeguard the DAO and its users.",294

Improving Governance participation
NFT development on Arbitrum

The goal of a DAO is very simple, a place where those involved in a community can propose ideas and pool funding to accomplish those ideas these community members can also use the proprietary technology associated with the DAO to innovate.  Liquidity mining acts as a very good incentive for new members of the DAO and returns are easy to market.  However a downside of this is without strong tokenomics, the value of $ARB can be diluted to a point where either it isnt worth it to stake or the liquidity is running out in the fund and it just gets sketchy.  In early stages an aggressive take on liquidity mining would be a good idea in my opinion as long as it is either scaled back or the tokenomics are developed to avoid dilution.
Sample voting issue 1:


For


Remove a Flipside seat on the allocation committee to keep the DAO more decentralized to influence innovation and representation.


It is a balancing act between the two because with centralization it is easier to complete tasks.  Opinions are less diverse, easier to rally up and overall more streamlined.  However, you miss out on what WEB 3.0 is all about; diverse ideas, innovation, and decentralization.  I think a unanimous only voting mechanism would be extremely counterproductive, so a decisive threshold of votes should be met in order for a proposal to pass.


Sample Issue 2:

Full Reimbursement only if the proposal to reimburse passes in a vote AND the treasury can afford the reimbursement.  The longevity of the project is the most important thing and if reimbursing kills all remaining liquidity and shortens the project’s runway, investors must understand that WEB 3.0 is harsh and should not be playing with money that they are not prepared to lose.  If the project can afford to reimburse AND the community sees it as fit, they should reimburse.  A project is still a company, WEB 3.0 or not, customer experience and brand identity matters.  A hack that a project is 100% responsible for that lost their investors money should be reimbursed if within budget.  Before any move a vote should be taken, if the majority of investors believe that the money is better spent inside of the project’s treasury than being returned to victims of the hack that is the way the project should move at risk of negative PR because that is fundamentally correct for a DAO.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO: eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
The overall goal of the Arbitrum DAO is to govern and support the development of the Arbitrum network, which is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum and that allows its members to collectively make decisions and take actions to support the network.
By providing incentives for liquidity mining, the Arbitrum DAO can encourage users to participate in the network and help improve its overall liquidity. This can increase trading volumes, attract more users to the network, and ultimately help support the growth and success of the network.
However, it’s important for the DAO to carefully consider its liquidity mining strategy and ensure that it aligns with the broader goals of the network. For example, the DAO may need to balance the level of liquidity mining incentives with the potential dilution of governance power and the potential impact on the token price. Additionally, the DAO may need to consider other strategies for supporting the network, such as providing grants or funding for development projects.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
How would you vote?
Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Giving Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program, the proposal could be amended to include a more diverse range of analytics service providers on the allocation and oversight committees. This could help to reduce the perception of favoritism towards one service provider and ensure that the decision-making process is more decentralized.
Another possible amendment could be to revise the allocation of seats on the committees to ensure a more balanced representation of stakeholders. For example, university clubs could still be included but with a smaller allocation of seats to avoid giving them an outsized influence on the decision-making process.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, it is important to strike a balance between efficiency and accountability. While centralized decision-making can help to expedite processes, it can also increase the risk of bias and limit transparency. Therefore, it is essential to establish clear guidelines, processes, and checks and balances to ensure that decision-making is fair, transparent, and accountable.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Split Reimbursement
split the reimbursement among the parties affected by the exploit. This approach would ensure that everyone receives some compensation, even if it is not the full amount. Splitting the reimbursement may help to alleviate some of the tension that has arisen due to the differing opinions on whether or not to refund those affected.
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
If it is found that a party was negligent in securing their assets or if they participated in fraudulent activity, then it may not be appropriate to reimburse them. Additionally, if a party was not directly impacted by the exploit, they may not be eligible for reimbursement. Ultimately, any decision on reimbursement should be made based on the facts of each case, and with the best interests of the community in mind.

For a robust DAO, there must be community inclusiveness and  encourage participation through incentives using powerful DAO platforms. It was through this, I stumbled on of the Arbitrum projects called Layer2dao and there community inclusiveness was second bar none. So in a simple terms for a DAO to thrive effectively, community comes first with at least incentivized quest and sense of belonging.

Uniswap Interface
Swap or provide liquidity on the Uniswap Protocol





Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Пожалуйста, поделитесь своим отношением к общим целям DAO:
насколько агрессивными мы должны быть в добыче ликвидности, какова цель DAO?
Я не самый большой поклонник добычи ликвидности, по крайней мере, напрямую от DAO; Я думаю, что в лучшем из многих случаев лучше всего применять к различным протоколам такие стимулы, может быть, такие как Optimism, который привнес разнообразное использование в свою сеть, косвенно стимулируя ее удобство использования и экосистему.
Пример вопроса голосования 1:

Как бы вы проголосовали?

Против

Какие поправки вы бы внесли в предложение, если таковые имеются?

Разнообразие мнений и участников должно быть основной целью ДАО, если небольшая группа централизует власть, название ДАО — это только совокупность.
Что-то, что может помочь, — это предопределить в начале создание комитетов и разграничить членов, которых он должен иметь, за счет увеличения разнообразия вопреки личным интересам.

Как бы вы подошли к компромиссу между централизацией власти и способностью добиваться цели?

Это плохая ссылка на DAO, чем более децентрализовано, тем труднее договориться, но я чувствую, что комитеты или делегаты выполняют эту жизненно важную функцию представления голоса многих для оптимизации процессов управления.
Пример вопроса голосования 2:

Раздельное возмещение

DAO должен обеспечить наилучшие условия для своих членов, а также учитывать их выживание, поэтому это будет во многом зависеть от случаев и типа взлома, буквально истощая их средства, я не думаю, что они могут заплатить.
Вот почему я думаю, что лучше всего, и в зависимости от случая, такого как FEI, вернуть деньги пострадавшим, возможно, в рамках системы наделения правами, или DAO может приступить к работе, чтобы заботиться об интересах своих пользователей.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:**
As Vitalik said large token holders (individual or a company) has too much influence on the vote. I think voting system should be like this:
Anyone with more then 10 ARB will be able vote but it will has a impact of 1. Well whales could spread 10 ARB to thousands of wallets but it will cost them least 0.20¢ each transaction.
I think main usage for the ARB token should be to decentralize the rollup. As you can agree Arbitrum right now is somewhat centralized. I am not a tech person but as i have read Sequencer could be decentralized with token (by giving the person running an sequencer small ARB rewards). Overall giving everyone the power of being in the Arbitrum Security Council is cool.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would propose a similar vote with other parties who are able to bring new users to also access similar bounties.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
In my view, the ability to get things done matters more to early stage DAOs, as often times things get stuck in a loop of repetitive debates for a long time, while the immediate objectives and goals of the proposal take a back seat. While network level decentralization is ultimately very important, in terms of execution there can be some leeway so as enable greater execution.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Whole situation seems very compilacted as it impacted both individual victims and DAO’s. I think giving individuals FEI and giving DAO’s DAI looks very unfair. There shouldnt be a split. Also I’m not a fan of giving small balance victims more and whales less. Everyone should get their payback equal.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
To approach this tradeoff, I would advocate for the following:

Implement a multi-signature approval system for critical decisions, involving a diverse group of stakeholders.
Encourage community involvement in the decision-making process through open forums, discussions, and voting.
Establish a rotating committee structure, where members from different backgrounds and expertise can contribute to various aspects of the DAO.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by many decentralized protocols to incentivize users to provide liquidity and boost platform adoption. While it can be effective in attracting new users and generating trading activity, it can also present some concerns that should be carefully considered and addressed.
One concern is that liquidity mining rewards can create an artificial demand for tokens, leading to inflated prices and potentially attracting speculators rather than long-term users. Additionally, the high cost of liquidity mining programs can result in unsustainable emission rates, causing long-term inflation and decreasing the value of the token.
To address these concerns, I Will consider implementing a number of strategies. For example, I can design liquidity mining programs that focus on rewarding long-term holders rather than short-term speculators. We can also use dynamic liquidity mining programs that adjust rewards based on real-time market conditions, ensuring that emission rates are sustainable and do not lead to long-term inflation.
Another approach would be Using a mix of incentives to attract users to the platform, including referral bonuses, staking rewards, and other mechanisms that do not rely solely on liquidity mining. We can also establish criterias that must be met before a liquidity mining program is launched, such as a minimum trading volume or user activity level, to ensure that the program will have a meaningful impact on the platform.
I am focused on long-term sustainability and success . Although I kinda like the concept of liquidity mining i am  cautious of liquidity mining and carefully consider the potential risks and benefits supporting any programs. By implementing thoughtful and well-designed liquidity mining programs, we can encourage healthy growth and adoption of Arbitrum while minimizing the risks associated with these incentives.

Split Reimbursement
Reimbursement of funds due to hacks or other complications may affect reputation or may posses distabilizing cost. I would Partially reimbursement both parties if the system was not fully compromised. But in a case of the other Reimbursement Should be carefully considered. so as to avoid uneccessary spending of funds after greater damage had already been done. But in no case will i fully reimburse users funds lost due to hack .
The aim of reimbursement should be to bring back lost users trust on the protocol due to the hack and also mainly to address the cause of the hack and also deal with anything that can cause such damaging situations

None.
Small groups specialized in different areas and that represent a group of people, might be one way to do it.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
3. Split Reimbursement. Because it depends on a few variables and specific things. If a 80M exploit happens at first, you must do everything possible for not happening again. If after just 1 month the same things happen, that’s just a poor way to handle security. Full and No Reimbursement are both 2 very strong extremes. Something in between might be better.

Improving Governance Participation

Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO.
How aggressive should we be in liquidity mining? What is the goal of the DAO?
Liquidity mining doesn’t really appeal to me, at least not directly from a DAO; I believe that applying incentives to various protocols, such as Optimism, which brought diverse uses to its network and incentivized it in an indirect way in terms of usability and ecosystem, is the best option in the majority of cases.
Sample voting issue 1
What modifications, if any, would you make to the proposal?
The variety of opinions and participation should be the fundamental goal of a DAO; if a small group concentrates power, the name DAO is only an aggregate.
It can be beneficial to pre-define committee creation and restrict the number of members they should have at the price of enhancing diversity in favor of personal interests.
How would you approach the balance between power centralization and the ability to complete tasks?
It’s a poor analogy for DAOs because it’s more difficult to reach an agreement the more decentralized a system is, but I believe committees or delegates do a fantastic job of expressing many people’s perspectives to improve governance procedures.
Sample Voting Issue No. 2
Split Reimbursement: A DAO must provide its members with the best possible environment and consider their survival; consequently, this will depend a great deal on the cases and the kind of hack; by literally draining their funds, I do not believe they can pay.
Consequently, I believe that the best course of action would be to return the affected individuals’ funds, possibly through a vesting system or by allowing the DAO to get to work protecting their users’ interests, depending on the circumstances, such as the FEI.

Gaming development on Arbitrum -

One of the benefits of using Arbitrum for gaming development is that it allows for fast and low-cost transactions, which is important for games that involve frequent in-game purchases or transactions. Additionally, because it is built on Ethereum, it is compatible with many of the existing tools and infrastructure available for Ethereum development, which can make development easier and more efficient.
To get started with gaming development on Arbitrum, developers can use existing game development tools and frameworks, such as Unity, to build their games. They can then integrate with the Arbitrum network using web3.js, which is a JavaScript library that allows developers to interact with Ethereum-compatible networks, including Arbitrum.


Improving Governance participation -
Community Engagement: Building a strong community around the project can also help improve governance participation. This can involve hosting events, engaging with stakeholders on social media, and creating channels for feedback and discussion.

Gaming development on Arbitrum
Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

Arbitrum is a blockchain-based platform that offers advantages to users who want to develop smart contracts. It offers additional security and transparency that is not available with other existing platforms. The platform is also open source and offers a decentralised development environment that is fast and easy to learn. Arbitrum-based smart contracts are also faster and more efficient than Ethereum-based smart contracts. Users can also benefit from high security thanks to the Zero-Knowledge Snark consensus technology. In addition, the platform is flexible enough to adapt to the needs of developers and their applications. Dao’s are beneficial for new decentralised protocols that give decision-making power to the token holder rather than to shareholders who have no economic pressure. This platform with its many advantages could become economically profitable thanks to its much healthier system.
I would vote for Arbitrum. The platform offers enhanced security, transparency, and a decentralized development environment that is fast and easy to get started with. Additionally, the platform is open source and contracts built on Arbitrum are faster and more efficient than those built on Ethereum. The high level of security provided by the Zero-Knowledge Snark consensus technology is also a major plus. Finally, the platform is flexible enough to accommodate the needs of both developers and their applications.
If I were making amendments to the proposal, I would suggest adding more information about the platform’s scalability, increasing the amount of resources available to developers building on the platform, and providing more technical support for developers. Additionally, I would suggest providing more information about the platform’s capabilities and potential applications. Finally, I would suggest exploring ways to make the platform more accessible to developers of all skill levels.
In terms of the trade-off between centralising authority and being able to get things done, I would focus on creating a secure and stable platform, while allowing for a degree of decentralisation. This could be achieved through a combination of technological solutions, such as consensus protocols, and governance models that ensure openness, transparency and accountability of the platform. In addition, I would ensure that any changes or updates to the platform are transparent to all users and that a communication and feedback loop is put in place to ensure that any problems or concerns are dealt with quickly and effectively.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
To increase general adoption of Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova through making choices that appeal to the most amount of people, not the most amount of liquidity. By focusing on individual users, liquidity and general adoption will follow.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

#2

No Reimbursement

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
I do not believe in refunding. I believe we should look at a smart contract as a contract. If someone is able to hack or exploit a smart contract then they have only operated within the bounds of the contract. While this is tough love, overtime, better contracts will be written and trusted players in the space will gain more and more value over nefarious characters and get rich quick schemes. I am for long term adoption.

Defi development on Arbitrum


Improving Governance participation


Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The ultimate goal of a DAO is to create a decentralized community. It is to prevent one entity from having the most influence. Even now, DAOs stray away from absolute decentralization. One big challenge that’s illustrated in DAO voting is how lopsided a big shareholder makes the voting count. Why should one big wallet outweigh thousands of others with minimal tokens? How to delegate many small wallets so it can equate to a whale, if not more?
Problem with liquidity mining is the sell pressure & impermanent loss that is created. A better route for Arbitrum would be to take part in POL (protocol-owned liquidity) by using OlympusDao’s infrastructure.
One product OlympusDao offers is Flex Loans:


Create dilution-resistant permanent liquidity


Bolster existing liquidity


Diversify treasury


Expand revenue opportunities


Grow Collateral through OHM network growth


Deploy capital for durable protocol-owned liquidity (OlympusDao dashboard).


Sample Voting issue 1:

I would vote AGAINST.
I’d like other service providers to have opportunity to formulate alternative plans for centralization to be reduced.
Throughout history, societies have accepted centralization of authority so they can proceed, but this only led to the centralized figures to grow more powerful than ever. Compromising for centralization in a space that boasts about decentralization is contradicting to its core.

Sample Voting Issue 2:

Full reimbursement.

The purpose of decentralization is to bring more fairness and justice to the weak with the softest voice. Choosing to not reimburse its users is unjust. This does not mean that all users should be reimbursed fully immediately. Protocol should formulate a plan in how to reimburse those affected fully while pushing forward with the project if feasible. Bean protocol was hacked for a tremendous amount. Yes, its users weren’t immediately reimbursed. However, the plan they put together is making the victims whole day by day.

In my opinion the DAO should be there to steer the overall development of Arbitrum, but generally not over-regulate things. In other words: Governing with a steady hand to enable sustainable growth. Liquidity incentives for instance should be minimal and very targeted, as they don’t work in the long run. Only a quality product will work in the long run.

Seats at the allocation committee should have been reduced to keep better decentralisation intact.

It’s similar to democracy vs authoritarian governments: Things might take longer to decide initially in a democracy (where different opinions need to be heard and accounted for), but in the end the decisions are better founded and have a higher chance of acceptance than in authoritarian (ie. top-down) decicion-making.

2. No Reimbursement. I understand that this might sound harsh, but exploits are unfortunately still a part of crypto. Once you start reimbursing for certain hacks or smart contracts exploits, where do you stop? I think the fairest approach is to not compensate.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I think the Arbitrum dao should really take some time learning from what has happened with Optimism and how they have used their DAO funds. I think it is wise to setup systems that allow token distributions for projects in the ecosystem. Grant funding allows the ecosystem to flourish which continues to bring in more people to it. I think this should be a similar aggressiveness to how OP has moved forward but like I said reflection on mistakes should be taken.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
I think the Arbitrum dao funds should be used in ways that allow for the most decentralization as possible. The issue with this mindset though is not everyone is up to speed on how to communicate or analyze situations in a way that is productive and furthers the ecosystem. For this scenario I think it was wise of Leshner and Dune to speak up and this is the power of decentralization. The DAO members who setup things and those who vote are held to a high responsibility and shouuld be chosen with caution to make sure they are members who can actually devote time to the network.
Against
I would discuss and create an amendment that would better allocate distribution of seats, as I see this being important. No more than 2/7 should have been allowed for this scenario given it would be easy for 3/7 to influence 1 person.
Getting things done is important however fairness is extremely important for decentralization and is something that must be held to a high standard even if it takes more work to get something done given the voters and delegates are representing a HUGE amount of funds and money.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
It is not the responsibility of the network to refund those who use applications on the network. Applications should be used with an understanding that there is a risk involved.
The problem with funding those who got affected by a hack for a decentralized app is that these can be gamed. It can be done in a way that could even drain more money out of the network, the hack can be planned, and the hack can be exploited to refund the hackers the money they stole if they play their cards right.

I believe democracy is democracy. Of course DAO manipulation is not a good thing but I don’t really see this as extremely egregious. I wouldn’t stop it.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

If people vote to centralize a certain process with a certain amount of funds that is acceptable. It is up to the voters to do what they wish to do. If the people of arbitrum decided a team should have 100% control with no oversight over some funds I wouldn’t oppose it. All that matters is ensuring the decision itself is decentralized. This could be done by perhaps rewarding dao participation, setting aside certain amounts for active voters and people who discuss topics in the dao.

Majority would rule.  There would be no tie breakers.  Abstain would result in a forfeiture of vote so that all proposals had have a conclusion.  I would also consider putting in a popular vote for seats every 6 months for anyone on the committee who had abstained from voting more than 50% of the time so that they could be replaced by an active committee member.  I would allow the community to actively lobby for and vote for that new member, within a set window of time.   The new member would have to be a talley member that would be selected vs written in.

Hack:

Full Reimbursement - I believe that the entity that was hacked should be responsible for reimbursement if the dao has funds available.  HOWEVER, if the hack was not the fault of the entity, Rari in this case, but due to a user error (signing something they shouldn’t have), then I would not reimburse anything.  If you want to build trust in your platform, it shouldn’t get hacked.

My hope is that Arbitrum insures itself, has DAO funds and runway available for development and that security audits prevent these types of hacks from happening.  Also limiting exposure to risk by diversification of arbitrum assets into different contracts, pools, etc…will help with respect to TVL and Defi, for example.

Im most interested in Helping DEFI development on Arbitrum
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I believe liquidity mining plays an essential role to the Growth of the ecosystem but it needs to be spent properly. For a IMO the Goal should be to skew more of the incentives to the developers in the ecosystem to create sticky liquidity from innovative protocols… There is a reason Ethereum doesn’t need to have liquidity mining incentives, Most of the innovation in Defi and NFTs were born on Ethereum.
You build great products, you build sticky liquidity.
This does not mean all of the incentives should go to the Devs. There should be some allocation that is shared with the community to create good will as well as encourage desired activities. (ex: boot strapping Anchor pools on a dex so there is enough liquidity on Chain).
There are 2 ways to spend money to incentivize liquidity, There is a right way and a wrong way.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Against, Bounties Should be allocated to the teams that have an outline of how the tokens are to be distributed and why. Also the team that is selected should be one that has had a proven track record to produce results.
In order to approach the tradeoff between centralization and the ability to get things done, There needs to be a way to measure and determine which team is best in an objective way. This can be done by placing a certain score for x or certain score for y, then using the sum of the individual scores to determine the teams ability to execute. Also note after selection there needs to be a monitoring period to see if milestones are being met.
Decisions should not be passed by one proposal then execution, there should be at least 2 or 3 phases before a proposal is made live to prevent pilferage and rash decisions. Also, the Decisions should be made by trusted members that have skin in the game and have aligned incentives with the community.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Arbitrum as a DAO should not be responsible for reimbursement for carelessness or negligence. Im not saying the situation was on purpose or malicious in any way, but there needs to be milestones or benchmarks in place to Validate reimbursement. An example is if audits were done, bug bounties put in place, insurance fund, ect.
When certain benchmarks are met, then it may justify partial reimbursement to help with the situation. If each and every hack was just to be paid out without the protocol practicing proper risk management then there will be protocols scamming and taking advantage of the system. Saying this in the nicest way possible, there are serial teams out there that dont care about user funds and just roll out a fork or protocol as fast as possible to make a quick buck. This should not be compensated even though users were harmed.
I have been hacked and rugged before and its just the nature of the beast we call Defi. No user should ever feel entitled to anything. Instead the Money should be invested to Educate users on how to practice “safe” Defi.
The money lost is considered the cost of tuition, for some it is more and others it is less but at some point in time we all have to pay our dues. Lord willing they are not expensive.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
A DAO is a decentralized, self-governing organization that operates on blockchain technology. It leverages smart contracts to automate decision-making and resource allocation.
An Arbitrum-based DAO might have goals similar to other DAOs, with an emphasis on leveraging the benefits of the Arbitrum platform. These goals could include:


Scalability: Utilizing Arbitrum’s Layer 2 solution to accommodate increased transaction volumes, allowing for more extensive participation and interaction within the DAO ecosystem.


Cost Efficiency: By operating on the Arbitrum platform, the DAO could aim to reduce transaction costs and gas fees, making it more accessible and user-friendly for members.


Interoperability: Ensuring seamless interaction between the DAO and other Ethereum-based applications, taking advantage of the compatibility provided by the Arbitrum platform.


Security: Leveraging the security of Ethereum’s underlying infrastructure while benefiting from Arbitrum’s additional security features, such as its fraud-proof system.


Speed: Capitalizing on the faster transaction processing capabilities of the Arbitrum platform to enhance the efficiency of the DAO’s operations.


Innovation: Experimenting with new governance models and use cases for the DAO, facilitated by the advanced capabilities and flexibility of the Arbitrum platform.


Decentralization, Transparency, Collaboration, Inclusivity, Adaptability, Trust, Sustainability, and Value Creation: As with other DAOs, an Arbitrum-based DAO may also pursue these common goals, ensuring a fair, open, and equitable environment for its members.


Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Description: The proposed bounty program is a collaboration between UniSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain, and Flipside Crypto, a data analytics platform specializing in blockchain and cryptocurrency data. The goal is to encourage the development of new tools, visualizations, and analytics that benefit the UniSwap ecosystem.
Objectives:

Encourage innovation and development within the UniSwap community.
Foster collaboration between developers, data analysts, and the broader UniSwap ecosystem.
Identify potential areas for improvement in UniSwap’s platform and user experience.
Increase awareness and understanding of UniSwap’s features, functionalities, and benefits.
Enhance the long-term growth and sustainability of the UniSwap platform.

Budget: The DAO would allocate a specific amount of funds (e.g., $50,000) to be distributed as rewards for winning submissions.
Timeline: The bounty program would run for a predetermined period (e.g., three months), with submissions evaluated and rewards distributed at the end of the program.
Voting Options:

Yes - Approve the funding and launch of the UniSwap/Flipside Bounty Program.
Sample Voting Issue 2:

Split Reimbursement: Approve a partial reimbursement of the lost funds to the affected parties, with the percentage to be determined by the DAO members.

As a DAO member, you would be asked to vote on one of these options, taking into account factors such as fairness, financial impact on the organization, potential reputational consequences, and the broader implications for the DAO’s governance and decision-making processes.

Share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The primary objective of a DAO is to facilitate the healthy and decentralized growth of the rollup. This vision can involve various aspects, ranging from technical and security-focused areas of the rollup (overseen by the DAO) to promoting the growth of a thriving ecosystem and ARB token. In essence, every decision made by the DAO should be rooted in the question, “How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of both the ARB token and the broader future of rollups?”
Based on this question, we can consider different roles that the DAO can play in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem and the balancing act required for each decision. Here are some examples:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: For Arbitrum to be genuinely community-owned, the DAO needs to oversee the protocol’s development and all layers of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter may not possess enough knowledge to make informed decisions about the fruitfulness of a development. One possible solution is to establish a technical subcommittee responsible for governance oversight in this area, which may ultimately report to the wider DAO. The DAO already plans to do this with the Security Council, but a similar approach could be taken for other technical areas.
Liquidity mining: Although this strategy can support short-term growth and user acquisition on selected protocols, it should not be viewed as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining is an excellent way to attract users seeking yields, but if it is subsidized for too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could result in an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants: While liquidity mining handles user growth and technical committees oversee the rollup itself, grants are the primary tool that the DAO can use to support builders. Grants must be handled with care, as they require a degree of social trust from both the DAO and builders. Builders must be able to demonstrate deliverables and accountability for the funding they receive. Despite the complexities, grants can enable the development of tools and dApps that the space may need but are currently unprofitable.

If holders are not divers and a small number of non-DAO entities holds a large amount of token, and then it could be not in the DAOs best interest to fully reimburse this loss.

My stance on overall goals for the DAOs:
The definite goal of DAO is always decentralization. The incentive of getting rewards by DAOs always comes from liquidity mining but it’s a high risk strategy.
The goal of liquidity mining is to rewards but at a good ratio and it should be aligned with the needs and priorities of the member of community.

However, excessive centralization can stifle innovation, curtail participation, and result in decisions that don’t take the needs and priorities of the larger community into account.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:


How would you vote?
Against


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
If there were concerns about the proposal’s centralization of power and the favoring of one service provider, some amendments could be made to address those issues. For example, the allocation and oversight committees could be restructured to include more diverse stakeholders, including other analytics service providers and community members with relevant expertise. The terms of the agreement could also be renegotiated to ensure that Flipside’s role is limited to providing analytics services and that the allocation of UNI tokens and oversight of the program are done in a more transparent and democratic manner.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. On the one hand, centralization can enable faster decision-making and more efficient implementation of programs. On the other hand, it can also lead to concentration of power and exclusion of diverse voices, which can undermine the legitimacy and effectiveness of the program in the long run. To address this tradeoff, it is important to strike a balance between centralized authority and decentralized participation, to ensure that decision-making processes are transparent, inclusive, and accountable.

The DAO’s decision-making process should prioritize the long-term sustainability and success of not only the ARB token, but also the wider rollups ecosystem. This fundamental question should guide the exploration of different roles that the DAO can play in the Arbitrum ecosystem, while maintaining a delicate balance with each decision. For instance, the DAO could consider establishing a technical subcommittee to oversee protocol and security upgrades, which could report back to the wider DAO. Similarly, while liquidity mining can help with short-term growth and user acquisition, the DAO should avoid subsidizing protocols for too long and focus on sustainable emissions. Finally, grants can support the development of necessary tools and dApps that may not be profitable at present, but must be carefully managed to maintain social trust between the DAO and builders, and ensure accountability for deliverables.

A key responsibility of a DAO is to create a supportive community and consider the financial well-being of its members. However, the decision on whether to reimburse members in the event of a hack will depend on the specific circumstances and severity of the hack. Simply liquidating the DAO’s funds may not be a feasible solution.
Therefore, in cases such as FEI, it may be more appropriate to provide compensation to those affected, perhaps with a vesting schedule or by actively pursuing solutions that prioritize the interests of its members.

Issue Overview 

How would you vote?:-  Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?:- Would update two things; a) changing the control dynamics such that the service provider doesn’t dominate the allocation and oversight committee. A section detailing any conflict of interest should be stated clearly so that such issues don’t fly under the radar b) A section detailing which all  analytics service providers were considered and reason for preferring Flipside alone. Could the campaign have been run with multiple service providers?
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done? This is a critical debate and there are plus points to both sides. However, it boils down to the principle of decentralization, and in any decision making that principle should not be sacrificed.Critical vulnerabilities type of issues are an exception, but all other decisions should be well discussed and voted on.

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement - Ideally the first vote decision should have been carried out. But after the second vote, I think the latest vote becomes abiding. Such situations may lead to loss in trust in governance. And to find the least damaging way forward while maintaining the sanctity of both votes I would strongly consider split  Reimbursement. I don’t think  split  reimbursement is a ‘on the fence’ kind of option in this particular case
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not:- Ideally, the projects should clearly communicate the type and magnitude of risks associated with it. Also, scenarios in which there is loss of funds, refund limits and backups to ensure that they can be met, should be outlined. Risk management, including black swan events, should be part of the project genesis and updated periodically. It cannot be left to when the situation actually arises. If the project does not have resources for proper risk management, the same should be communicated and investors should acknowledge that by participating they are waving off any right to a refund. And in such cases, refund should be only provided after doing an impact analysis.

The goal of a DAO is to create a decentralized community-driven organization that operates autonomously without the need for centralized management. The DAO’s decision-making process is governed by its members, who use their voting power to make decisions and shape the direction of the organization.
When it comes to liquidity mining within a DAO, the goal is typically to incentivize liquidity providers to contribute to the ecosystem’s growth and sustainability. By providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange or protocol, liquidity providers help to increase the liquidity of the market, which can result in lower trading fees and more efficient price discovery.
The level of aggressiveness in liquidity mining largely depends on your risk tolerance and investment goals. If you’re comfortable with taking on more risk, you can be more aggressive in your liquidity mining strategy to potentially earn higher rewards.

FOR
nothing more
One way to approach this tradeoff is to strike a balance between centralization and decentralization based on the specific context and goals of the organization. For example, some decisions may need to be centralized for efficiency and consistency, while others may benefit from decentralized decision-making to foster creativity and innovation.

It’s also important to establish clear processes and protocols for decision-making and accountability to ensure that centralized decision-makers are held responsible for their actions and are accountable to the broader community. This can be achieved through mechanisms such as regular reporting, transparency in decision-making, and active participation of stakeholders in decision-making processes.

Gaming development on Arbitrum
Gaming industry takes some percentage at utility solutions for real world. Focusing on professionallism by adjusting an organised spider-web type company system for decentralised organisations, and working with more efficiency in more solid way. Workin smarter but also harder.
As I Co-founded an Energy & software company in 2020, I worked at high-tech systems and saw that cycle of GAME CHANGER IDEA - RISE - CHAOS - COLLAPSE - HAVING PROCEDURES - ORDER continues on every sector, every century.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
non-  Self-regulatory systems are weak from design. as an Robotics Engineer, I can say clearly that most advanced systems -macro and micro- are basically closed loop.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Authority is hoped to do what believed of the authorized community to be applied properly. Centralization on human design leads converging to one, because being rightful, knowing all and not having a match is impossible for any human, or product of human. which leads self authorized decentralization is the key. Satoshi was a ghost just for that. his existence was a threat to decentralization. He might have been went suicide just for the sole purpose of his and that won’t shock the blockchain thinkers.

Full reimbursement

Nobody will believe in a project that reflect its own problems to users one time. Hacked network is ours fault, not compensating it is one way to hell. You can’t expect to get going after that. Tons of examples were set in the history of cryptocurrencies. Being hacked resulted by not focusing on security enough to cover the growth on ecosystem.

Not so much but im looking and interesting with the way Arbitrum working with and I hope Arbitrum will be a healthy DAO.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The DAO helps participants regain “rights” that they have not touched for a long time.
The plans of an organization, which are normally known and decided only by the top figures, now all members can know and vote, the results will be carried out according to the wishes of the majority. .
Organization members don’t put a lot of emphasis on knowing and trusting each other, as every action will now be recorded on-chain, opening up new possibilities for cooperation.
Applying game theory, participants hold a part of the DAO, so they will choose proposals to help develop the DAO, the proposed proposals must also be considered to create benefits for the majority.
And many more advantages are waiting to be discovered.

As a person who wants the best for the entire Arbitrum ecosystem, I believe that the overall goal of the DAO should be to promote the development and growth of the ecosystem in a sustainable manner. This can be achieved by pursuing initiatives that improve user adoption, increase liquidity, and enhance the overall user experience. Regarding liquidity mining, I believe that it can be a useful tool to attract users and incentivize participation, but it should be done in moderation to prevent excessive volatility.
Regarding the first voting issue, I would vote against the proposal as it gives too much control to a single service provider, which could lead to centralization of power and potential conflicts of interest. If amendments were to be made, I would suggest reducing the amount of control given to Flipside crypto and including other analytics service providers in the proposal. When approaching the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, I believe that a balance can be struck by ensuring that decision-making power is distributed across multiple parties while still maintaining a streamlined and efficient process.
Regarding the second voting issue, I would choose the option of split reimbursement as it recognizes the impact of the hack on affected parties while also promoting responsibility and accountability in the overall ecosystem. It is right to refund parties when the hack was due to vulnerabilities in the underlying technology or the fault of the platform, but not in cases where the user was at fault (e.g., through negligence or phishing scams).
I am fluent in English and proficient in Polish. Regarding conflicts of interest, I affirm that I do not have any conflicts of interest that would prevent me from using my best judgment to operate in the best interests of advancing the Arbitrum ecosystem.",364

In my view, the overall goals of a DAO should be aligned with the values and priorities of its community members. DAOs can be a powerful tool for promoting decentralized decision-making and empowering individuals to collectively achieve shared goals. However, it is important for DAOs to maintain their decentralized structure and foster an engaged and inclusive community.

On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation and creativity, limit the diversity of perspectives and ideas, and increase the risk of corruption or abuse of power. A centralized approach can also lead to a lack of transparency and accountability, as decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or groups.
In the context of a DAO, it is important to balance the benefits of centralization with the advantages of decentralized decision-making and community involvement. DAOs are designed to promote transparency, accountability, and inclusivity by enabling individuals to collectively make decisions.",365

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is an organization that operates through rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts. The goals of a DAO are determined by its members and can vary depending on the DAO’s purpose. Some common goals of DAOs include:

Decentralization: DAOs aim to eliminate central authorities and intermediaries and operate in a decentralized manner, with decisions made by a consensus of its members.
Transparency: DAOs strive to be transparent in their decision-making processes and the allocation of their resources.
Community-driven: DAOs are often driven by a community of like-minded individuals who share a common goal.
Governance: DAOs aim to establish a system of governance that ensures fair and equitable decision-making processes.
Efficiency: DAOs strive to operate in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

Overall, the goals of a DAO are determined by its members and can vary depending on the DAO’s purpose and the needs of its community.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty

How would you vote?
2.For*
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

One potential amendment could be to adjust the allocation committee and oversight committee to have a more balanced representation of stakeholders and analytics service providers, rather than giving an overwhelming amount of control to one entity. Additionally, it may be beneficial to have more transparency and communication with the broader Uniswap community to ensure that their concerns and perspectives are taken into account.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

To approach this tradeoff, it’s important to consider the specific context and goals of the organization or project. In some cases, centralizing authority may be necessary for achieving a specific outcome or moving quickly in a rapidly changing environment. In other cases, a more decentralized approach may be preferable for promoting inclusivity, diversity of ideas, and avoiding potential conflicts of interest.
One potential solution is to strike a balance between centralization and decentralization, by delegating decision-making power to smaller teams or committees that are representative of different stakeholders or perspectives. Another approach could be to implement checks and balances, such as regular review processes or accountability measures, to ensure that centralized authority is used responsibly and effectively.
Ultimately, the approach to balancing centralization and decentralization depends on the specific circumstances and goals of the organization or project, and requires careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits of each approach.
Split Reimbursement
In terms of handling the situation, it is important to consider the impact on the affected parties and the overall health of the ecosystem. Reimbursement may be necessary in certain instances, particularly when the loss was due to a security vulnerability that was beyond the control of the affected parties. However, it is also important to ensure that reimbursement is not abused and that it does not encourage risky behavior.
In the case of the FEI RARI hack, it would be important to thoroughly investigate the circumstances of the hack and determine whether reimbursement is appropriate. If it is determined that reimbursement is necessary, then the amount and terms of the reimbursement should be carefully considered to ensure that it is fair and does not incentivize risky behavior.
In general, I believe that reimbursement should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific circumstances of each incident. There may be instances where full reimbursement is appropriate, while in other cases, partial or no reimbursement may be warranted. Ultimately, the decision should be made based on a careful assessment of the situation and the impact on the ecosystem as a whole.

Roles in the Arbitrum ecosystem include:
Technical protocol and security upgrades: Community-owned oversight, potentially through a technical subcommittee, ensures fruitful developments.
Liquidity mining: A short-term growth strategy, but over-subsidization can lead to unhealthy protocol subsidies.
Grants: Targeting builders, these require careful handling and social trust but can foster the development of tools and dApps.

Centralization is necessary when specialist knowledge and quick action are required, as long as the central entities remain transparent and dependent on the DAO’s approval. Trusted members should manage these centralizing points.

Hacks and fund losses hinder trust and onboarding in the crypto space. Partial reimbursement should be considered for parties who trusted the protocol’s security.
However, full reimbursement may not be feasible if a hack severely impacts the protocol. Compensation should balance stakeholder support with the potential negative consequences for the DAO. Future DAO insurance protocols may help address this issue.

Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO:
I believe that the overall goals of a DAO should prioritize decentralization, transparency, and inclusiveness in decision-making to ensure that the community’s views are represented. I recognize the importance of Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum’s adoption and advocate for the DAO to support and invest in such solutions. This is why in my opinion, funding public goods initiatives is crucial to accelerate the development of the ecosystem, as seen through the positive impact of the Optimism Grants.
Sample Voting Issue 1
How would you vote?
I would like to provide additional information for readers here in Arbitrum forum about this proposal, as I believe that the description on the first comment in this thread lacks information. In the Flipside<>Uniswap proposal, the Flipside team was asking that:
A grant of 25M $UNI was given to them so they can LP to the univ3 WETH-UNI pool and generate fees. They would not own these funds, they would just manage them.
They wanted to split LP fees (estimated in 30% APR) 50% to Flipside for managing the position and creating analytics for uniswap, and 50% to fund “bounties” that would onboard new users to Uniswap. The idea was to capture more users and bring them to the Uniswap ecosystem.
They proposed the creation of 2 committees to do this, as the original comment describes. In both committees, Flipside would have participation.
I would have voted no to this proposal. Reasons:
There is a conflict of interest between the committees managing this grant and paying themselves a share to fund their operations
50% of management fees seem excessive
The 30% estimated APR was not clearly explained, and some comments suggested it was not conservative. A good idea would be that they include their models so that people can reproduce them
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Their idea of using Uniswap’s treasury to generate fees and then use those fees to fund operations was very good to me. The issue I would have had was with the relationship between the vendor being contracted (Flipside), the manager of the funds and yield strategy (Flipside) and the company that had the most share of decision power in the committees (Flipside). I would start here when thinking of a change to be proposed moving forward.
No one can deny the value that something like CEA (Community-Enabled Analytics) (which is what they were proposing to build) would have had in the Uniswap ecosystem, as many people would find it extremely useful. But there were many potential service providers to be considered, and this was unaccounted for when drafting this proposal.
I also noticed that universities such as the MIT and Upenn voted yes, and apparently they would be getting seats in the committee. In my opinion, this does not look good, at all. The proposal said that the committee would have “2 Individuals from University Blockchain Orgs. To be Identified and Announced Post On-Chain Vote so as to not influence voting.” It seems they voted yes, as it can be seen on-chain.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Regarding the RARI hack, it’s a complex situation. On the one hand, if a DAO has a sufficient treasury to cover losses from a hack (outside of their own tokens) I would vote immediately in favour to reimbursements. If the DAO has only its own governance tokens, a question might arise: why should holders of the token be punished in the expense of people providing liquidity? Since distributing governance tokens as a reimbursement would most definitively cause sell pressure, this could be seen as going against the interest of token holders. However, another person might answer that the tokens and token holders are directly tied to the protocol, and if the protocol suffers a hack, it’s inevitable that token price will be impacted, one way or another.
In this case, there were many DAOs involved that had a claim on the FEI being distributed. For example, Olympus Finance had a 9M FEI claim on this, FRAX had 12.M. It is also possible that DAOs working together could reach a potential better solution since there’s more ammunition to work with.
My priority when deciding the outcome of this proposal would be to use and deplete as much as possible DAO funds that don’t impact token price first. Then, move with governance tokens and partially team allocations - and try to reach a solution amongst everyone. Regardless, this was an extremely complex situation and there was, in my opinion, not a right or wrong answer. There were many interests involved.
One thing that I am certain of is that I would have considered and researched every interest to the full extent of my capabilities, to try and seek the best solution to cast my vote. Best as in the one that have the most positive impact in the most people possible.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

Daos should be completely transparent.It’s great that people’s ideas are in management.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
How would you vote?
Against! Because power must be distributed in daos.In daos where power is not distributed, sometimes management can do good things.But we can’t take the risk of that.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
It would reduce the number of seats on Flipside’s allocation committee, and I would consider presenting it that way.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
As the authority is centralized, it may be easier to do some things, but this has some risks as a result. Therefore, there should not be much difference between the balances of power.
Sample Voting Issue 2:

My passion in life is listening to Arbitrum AMAs and Andreessen Horowitz
DAO Goals
The main goals for the DAO should be the vibe and the responsibility distribution
we must let the baghol-…DAO members vibe and become rich (rich in love not in money) while the Nitrodelegates shamelessly snort coke and burn treasury money in a basement full of hookers.
Just like Sushi but without the horses
The token distribution is my main concern,
it is crucial to distribute the remaining tokens to new users at the pico top
we should not do more airdrops instead we should take example on Sergey Betray CEO of Stink (Ticker: Link) and just dump treasury funds on the crowd 6mio tokens at a time for years, the true decentralized fair way.
With great supply comes great responsibilities.

Areas of interest:
Interested in contributing to the Gaming development on Arbitrum and IRL community building meetups (London and UK) also NFT development.
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Not that interested in Liquidity mining, I think building and use case is better focus, i.e. gaming, NFTs IRL Community events etc.
DAO should be focused on long term vision for growth of the community and the token to facilitate this growth and development of utility and community. Grants to enable building for example would be good start - I am developing a game in the UK to be focused on Blockchain if possible and have sought innovation funding for this in UK which we are waiting for but would prefer to utilise a grant from a decen network DAO instead to facilitate innovation in web3 - this is my personal example.
Decen is important yet retaining a council to govern is also useful as otherwise can hinder the speed of rollout of decisions which is key. Other DAOs I have participated in have seen that slowness and lack of accountability and blaming the community is a way out for leaders to lead - so we need good council leadership that respects community and DAO yet able to lead, project manage and deliver - similar to my global corp days running global programs or indeed film crew and communities I run IRL now.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Vote against
None
Small committee to PM and oversee DAO decisions is key as otherwise can lead to slowness and lack of accountability. Not too small as I have seen other DAO founders become more morally questionable and have a lack of integrity due to power and access to funds making it more of a DAO on paper which also does not work.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
3. Refunding a few over the lack of security so masses suffer cost is wrong, and also not reimbursing is not supporting the community, a balanced approach is needed to encourage responsibility.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
 Issue Overview 244

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?

For

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Reduce Flipside seats on the allocation committee to 2/7.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

Centralisation of authority can be a key issue hampering ostensibly decentralised systems. Efficient decisionmaking should ideally be driven by incentive alignment and accountability to the community, rather than one party having a significantly large chunk of power that they need not worry about their opposition. Where appropriate, individuals or organisations should be granted sufficient agency to put value-add proposals into practice - so we would have voted For this proposal.

FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hack was brought forward: this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

Full Reimbursement

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
This is a unique issue due to the alignment of Rari Capital and Tribe DAO. Ordinarily, members of Tribe would have no mandate to refund users of another protocol who had incurred losses. However, when Tribe acquired Rari, this should have included all assets and liabilities of Rari itself. The perceived non-willingness of Rari devs to work on their protocol after the acquisition should not have been used as an excuse to avoid refunding harmed users.
The vote against refunding was also primarily driven by a small number of large Tribe stakeholders, whose financial position could have been materially affected by the choice of whether or not to refund. CBS would have voted to make affected users whole again.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Our main conflict of interest is that as a University Society, we will not own our own voting power but will rather be receiving this power as delegations from others. For many delegates this is not an issue - but many Universities and student groups co-ordinate with one specific large provider of voting power, and this should be taken into consideration. We will endeavour to minimise any external influence as much as possible.

2.by reducing Flipside’s control and involving other analytics service providers in the proposal. This can be done by giving Flipside a smaller number of seats on the committees, and by inviting other providers to join the distribution and oversight committees. Additionally, the proposal should be more transparent and discussed openly within the community, instead of being “under the radar.” This will ensure that all stakeholders have a say in the decision-making process and that the proposal is fair and inclusive. By optimizing the scheme, Uniswap can achieve its goal of attracting new users while also maintaining the trust and support of its existing community.

Improving Governance participation
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
DAO stands for “Decentralized Autonomous Organization,” and it refers to an organization that operates using blockchain technology and smart contracts instead of traditional hierarchical structures. The main idea behind a DAO is to create a democratic and decentralized community that makes decisions collectively and transparently, without the need for intermediaries or central authorities.
The overall goals of a DAO may vary depending on its specific purpose and the community that governs it. However, some common objectives of a DAO may include promoting transparency, accountability, and inclusivity, facilitating community participation and decision-making, and fostering innovation and collaboration.
Ultimately, the success of a DAO depends on its ability to achieve its goals while maintaining a balance between decentralization and governance. A DAO must be able to provide its members with a transparent and trustworthy framework for decision-making while also being flexible and adaptable enough to respond to changing circumstances and challenges.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
1.How would you vote?
Against
2. 1What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
To address concerns that Flipside has too much control over the bounty program, the following modifications could be made to the proposal:
1.Reduce the number of seats that Flipside holds on the committee responsible for allocating UNI tokens to approved bounty projects. Instead, the committee should be composed of a diverse range of community members and representatives from Uniswap, including developers, designers, educators, content creators, and other stakeholders.
2.Ensure that the allocation of UNI tokens is transparent and fair by establishing clear guidelines and criteria for evaluating and approving bounty projects. The committee should also ensure that there is a clear process for evaluating proposals and awarding bounties.
3.Provide regular updates on the progress of the bounty program and the allocation of UNI tokens. These updates should include information on the projects that have been approved, the amount of UNI tokens allocated, and the impact of the projects on the Uniswap ecosystem.
4.Encourage community members to provide feedback and suggestions for improving the bounty program. This could be done through a dedicated forum or other communication channels.
5.Consider partnering with other analytics service providers or community-driven initiatives to promote adoption of Uniswap, rather than relying solely on Flipside. This would ensure that the bounty program is open and accessible to a wide range of stakeholders, rather than favoring one service provider.
By making these modifications to the proposal, the Uniswap Community Bounty Program can be designed to be more in line with the DAO’s organizational norms of transparency, fairness, and community engagement, while also addressing concerns around centralization and control.
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a key consideration for any organization, including a DAO like Uniswap. On one hand, centralization can enable quick decision-making and efficient execution of initiatives. On the other hand, it can limit the input and participation of community members, and create power imbalances that may not align with the values and principles of a decentralized organization.
To balance these considerations, I would suggest the following approach:

Emphasize transparency and accountability: Establish clear guidelines and criteria for decision-making and ensure that all stakeholders have access to information about how decisions are being made. This can help build trust and ensure that the decision-making process is fair and consistent.
Encourage community participation: Provide opportunities for community members to participate in decision-making, whether through voting, feedback mechanisms, or other means. This can help ensure that the interests of the community are represented in decision-making and reduce the risk of centralization of power.
Foster diversity and inclusivity: Ensure that decision-making bodies are composed of a diverse range of community members, with a variety of perspectives and experiences. This can help ensure that decisions are well-informed and reflect the needs and interests of the broader community.
Establish clear processes for governance: Ensure that there are clear processes and structures in place for decision-making, including guidelines for how decisions are made, who has the authority to make decisions, and how decisions can be challenged or appealed.

By adopting these principles, a DAO like Uniswap can balance the need for efficient decision-making with the values of transparency, community participation, and inclusivity.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The goal of the DAO is to maximize the returns and benefits of liquidity mining for its members. To achieve this goal, we need to strike a balance between aggressive and conservative liquidity mining strategies. We should strive to be aggressive enough to capture the maximum amount of rewards, while still being cautious enough to protect the liquidity of the DAO’s funds. With careful planning and execution, we can ensure that the DAO’s members get the most out of liquidity mining without taking on unnecessary risks.

How would you vote?
For
I would be in favor of it with some amendments. I believe that Uniswap should use Flipside to attract new users and incentivize them to join Uniswap, however, I think that Flipside should not have too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program. I believe that there should be a more balanced distribution of control, allowing other analytics providers to have a say in the allocation committee and oversight committee. Furthermore, I would suggest that the university clubs should have more than one seat on the allocation committee, as this would help provide a more diverse perspective. Lastly, the oversight committee should have at least one additional seat that represents a different analytics provider. This would ensure that all analytics providers have a say in the program and alleviate concerns about centralization of power and favoritism.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
In this situation, I would argue for a Split Reimbursement, in which those most affected by the hack are reimbursed in full, while those who were more fortunate and did not suffer major losses are reimbursed at a lower rate. This approach acknowledges the fact that not everyone was harmed equally by the exploit, and that some people were more severely affected than others, and thus deserves a greater compensation. Additionally, this approach allows those who were less affected to receive some form of recompense, while also ensuring that those who were most affected are not left with nothing.
In deciding who should be eligible for full reimbursement, it is important to take into account a number of factors, such as how much money was lost, how long the victim has been holding Rari, and whether or not the victim has suffered any other losses due to the hack. Additionally, it is important to ensure that all eligible victims are given the opportunity to apply for the reimbursement, so that no one is left behind. Finally, it is important to ensure that any funds given to those who are less affected are used to help strengthen Rari’s security measures, so that a similar attack does not happen in the future.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Forming an effective and truly decentralized governance system is critical for us to create to uphold our values in the future when blockchain technology is widely adopted. In the beginning of Web2 Google engineers in a basement came up with the saying “Don’t be evil”. This didn’t work out so well as we see in the current landscape of extractive ultra capitalism. In Web3 we need strive to build guard rails against the capture of these system so we “Can’t be evil”.
In my perspective, the primary goal of the Arbitrum Decentralized DAO is to foster a robust, secure, and efficient ecosystem that empowers the community to govern and steer the development of the Arbitrum network. This involves promoting transparency, collaboration, and equitable decision-making processes.
To achieve these aims, I believe the DAO should focus on the following key objectives:

Encourage Decentralized Governance: As a delegate, I would strive to facilitate an open and inclusive environment, ensuring that all users & stakeholders have a voice in the decision-making process. By promoting decentralization, we can avoid undue concentration of power and foster a thriving protocol.
Enhance Network Security and Resilience: The DAO should prioritize the continuous improvement of the network’s security and resilience to potential threats, ensuring that user assets and the overall ecosystem remain secure and stable.
Drive Innovation and Growth: The DAO should actively support the development and implementation of novel use cases, tools, and infrastructure to further the adoption of the Arbitrum network. This will attract a diverse array of developers and projects, driving value for both the network and its users.
Foster Community Engagement: Building a strong, collaborative community is essential for the DAO’s success. As a delegate, I would promote initiatives to engage the community through regular communication channels, online & offline meetups. And educational programs. By doing so, we can create a healthy feedback loop that helps the DAO stay attuned to the needs and desires of its members.
Uphold Sustainability and Ethical Practices: The DAO should emphasize the importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in its decision-making processes. This will ensure that the ecosystem remains sustainable and adheres to ethical practices, bolstering its long-term success.

I firmly believe that by focusing on these objectives, the Arbitrum Decentralized DAO can pave the way for a prosperous, secure, and inclusive ecosystem that benefits all current and future users. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the DAO as a delegate and to work alongside the community to shape the future of the Arbitrum network.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of serving the Arbitrum community and working together towards our shared vision.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Uniswap planned to use Flipside:
No with Amendment – This is a disconcerting conflict of interest between Flipside & Uniswap governance. Because of the clear conflict, I would require → 

The 3 members of the allocation committee would have to abstain from all oversight of budget for this program. Any collusion or coercion by those members to affect other members would be found would result in the firing of these committee members. These seats could also be temporarily replaced by independent actors voted by community.
The 1 of 3 seats on Oversight committee would have to abstain from oversight of this program. Another independent actor, voted by DAO, would replace them temporarily for this task (or we could possibly use popular vote from community dao that have 1/3 voting rights on actions)

Sample Voting Issue 2:
FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement:
Partial or Full Refund - This is an extremely complex situation that needs to be considered case by case.
There are important factors that affect the decision to refund users in case of a security issue. I do believe it is the clear responsibility and should be first priority of a project to guard it’s users.
There is also an important thing to consider in any protocol – If you refund users (or conversely don’t), and the protocol dies, is that better for the users? If the protocol is able to go on and pay back users first a partial refund and then for example a percentage of future revenue this may work better for everyone.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Here are, from my point of view. some benefits of a DAO:


Decentralization: DAOs are decentralized organizations that operate on blockchain technology, making them less reliant on centralized authorities such as governments, corporations, or banks. This enables DAOs to be more transparent and democratic.


Transparency: All the transactions made in a DAO are recorded on the blockchain, making it transparent to all members. This ensures that every decision is made based on consensus, and no single entity has more power than the others.


Efficiency: DAOs can operate 24/7 without any interruption, which means that decisions can be made and implemented quickly, without any delay. This makes DAOs highly efficient and effective.


Incentivization: DAOs use tokens as a way of incentivizing members to contribute to the organization. Members can earn tokens by contributing to the DAO, and these tokens can be used to vote on decisions or to earn a share of the profits.


Lower Costs: DAOs do not require any physical infrastructure, and they can operate with a minimal workforce, which means that they have lower overhead costs. This makes DAOs an attractive option for startups or small organizations.


Community-driven: DAOs are community-driven organizations, which means that members have a sense of ownership and are actively involved in the decision-making process. This results in a strong community spirit and fosters collaboration among members.


Flexibility: DAOs are highly flexible, and they can be adapted to different needs and requirements. This means that they can be customized to suit specific industries or niches, making them an ideal option for specialized organizations.


Overall, DAOs have the potential to revolutionize the way organizations operate, enabling a more democratic and transparent approach to decision-making.

I believe that the main goal of DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem, which in turn will be able to withstand changes in the market as well as quickly navigate and be flexible.
The Arbitrum delegates, in my opinion, should contribute to the development of the community and maintain a healthy atmosphere. And the project itself should be rewarded and encouraged in every way possible.
As far as liquidity mining is concerned, we need to be careful and consider all the previous mistakes.
Of course, healthy communication with other communities will only give impetus to do something new, cool. It certainly won’t be superfluous.
As I said, we work as a “BAT” team and our team’s key loyalties are: transparency, trust, interests in making decisions for the good of the team, not just one person. Which is exactly what I would like to see in Arbitrum DAO.

how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
I am not the biggest fan of liquidity mining, at least not directly from a DAO; I think that in the best of many cases the best is to apply to different protocols that kind of incentives, maybe like Optimism that brought diverse uses to its network incentivizing it in an indirect way in usability and ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

How would you vote?

Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO, if a small group centralizes power, the name DAO is only an aggregate.
Something that can help is to predefine in the beginning the creation of committees and delimit the members it should have at the expense of increasing diversity against personal interests.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is a bad reference to the DAOs, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree, but I feel that the committees or delegates fulfill that vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize the governance processes.
Sample Voting Issue 2:

Split Reimbursement

A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and also take into account their survival, therefore it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, by literally draining their funds I do not think they can pay.
That’s why I think the best thing to do, and depending on the case like FEI, is to return money to those affected, maybe under a vesting system or the DAO can get down to work to look after the interests of its users.

Most interested in contributing to DeFi development and improving governance participation.
I am a long term Arbitrum user - bridged shortly after the chain went live.
Overall goals for the DAO:
Security on optimistic roll-ups is currently my main concern. We need to strive to quickly decentralize existing points of failure and continue the dialogue with the security community to alleviate user concerns. The biggest black spot on the Arbitrum security is the amount of the bounty paid out to Riptide last year. I believe we should strive to repair that, and send a clear message that white hat hackers will benefit more from reporting bugs than exploiting them.
Taking a balanced approach to liquidity mining is crucial. I believe volume needs to dictate rewards and not vice versa! Attracting liquidity and volume with aggressive rewards usually has negative long term effects on protocols. With so much liquidity already locked on arbitrum without existing incentives, we need to reward users and help new projects bootstrap. In an ideal world, dynamic rewards would be great, but with current infrastructure we can settle for short term, data driven decisions.
Lastly, Arbitrum needs outside-the-box ideas to keep DAO governance involvement high. Even some of the best DAOs move at a snail pace. I was a keen observer of the deal between MakerDAO Huntington Valley Bank, and it’s a real shame that Tradfi bankers, lawyers, and regulators were able to move the needle faster than MakerDAO delegates! We need to not be afraid to try new systems to keep Arbitrum DAO from falling into the same traps as the predecessors. Perhaps we can create “ministries” for different groups of decisions to reduce the amount of votes needed to make a decisions on proposals. Those most connected to Gamefi should be able to push votes through without the input of Defi experts, and vice versa (of course within reason).
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Against
While the inability to pass proposals is one of the biggest downsides of DAOs today, I believe this particular proposal allocated TOO MUCH uni tokens to Flipside given their relatively unproven track record at the time and the centralized control. I think these kinds of partnerships need to start small and then grow in size based on delivered metrics.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
1 Full Reimbursement
Security is a topic extremely close to my heart. When users lose funds due to no fault of their own, I believe that the protocol needs to do everything in its power to make the users whole. At the very least a partial reimbursement is necessary in this case. Long-term longevity of any project depends on users, and a hack is the biggest deterrent for DeFi users.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.

These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reinbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors. 3 A full reinbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.
Languages I speak and write: By order of preference - English, Spanish, Italian
Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will obviously be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionaly, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which although is also part of the wider ethereum ecosystem it could be considered a conflict of interest. Currently, I am being allocated ~ 1k OP. In addition to this, ParaSwap has also been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme recipients, and if necessary, the representative of ParaSwap could be a different DAO member if this is considered a major conflict of interest. Personally, I believe that the growth of any decentralised rollup on the Ethereum ecosystem is a net positive for everyone in the space, and I will do my best to lend my knowledge in bettering the entire space
To approach this tradeoff, I would advocate for the following:

Implement a multi-signature approval system for critical decisions, involving a diverse group of stakeholders.
Encourage community involvement in the decision-making process through open forums, discussions, and voting.
Establish a rotating committee structure, where members from different backgrounds and expertise can contribute to various aspects of the DAO.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

Improving Governance participation
IRL Arbitrum community gatherings



Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?

Majority of current DAOs aren’t able to deliver on the true nature of being fully autonomous, but as stated, Arbitrum has made it to the second stage of the Vitalik Schema, therefore, there is much more confidence in the direction that Arbitrum is headed.
Liquidity mining is an effective way to lend and help with growth of an ecosystem, but it’s not the only way to provide back to a DAO, so a moderately aggressive approach should be sufficient based on current demand for Arbitrum. Prime example is the $ARB token being airdropped to early adopters, which will eventually be used more of what it was created for, i.e. governance, and less about price/speculation.
The ultimate goal of the DAO is to form a tight community of like-minded believers who want to see the overall health, growth, and development of Arbitrum be successful for centuries to come. This begins with a thoughtfulness about who is included into the DAO, and continual progress to obtain full decentralized and autonomous governance (I’m so excited for this feature in Arbitrum already… yayyy!)

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?


In a DAO, your tokens, transaction history and your time are your votes. If you are an active member based on time stamp data and you carry many tokens/time spent on a platform, then members of the DAO that fit this bucket should lead (tradeoff would be that passionate, lower voting weight members may bring valuable feedback, yet don’t have the power to implement changes).
Votes locked in by a DAO, whos overall main focus and voting patterns led to proposals to further the ecosystem, with the very heart of each vote being about decentralization then I think that prevents too much power by a centralized entity. So as people become a part of the DAO, values/morals would/should be the first thing voted on.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
Split Reimbursement
The crypto space is riddled with good and bad actors, and when hacks happen, most of the time the protocol that gets hacked is then FUDDED without regard for community members who are now negatively effected monetarily and emotionally. Trust can be lost instantly, so to instill/maintain trust happens based on how protocols respond in these situations. Either they support those who support them or they don’t. If web2 legacy systems can see where crypto faces adversity, but they always rise above it based on strength of community and having a DAO that is autonomously reimbursing members affected, almost instantaneously via secure blockchain transactions, then this may show legacy systems the power of quick payments and loyalty between protocols and community members. Split reimbursement helps to keep the protocol afloat while also mending the bridges that may be fractured by community members. My quick one liner is: investors/community members took on risk, then the risk had a bad outcome, yet their involvement helped the protocol, then at that point the protocol + community should support each other - $ going back to the protocol to recoup losses, and some $ as token of support should go back to community members even if not all of it is returned.

My idea of our community is to deepen the dominance of Arbitrum in the eth-native 2nd layer space. Arbitrum will be used as the global settlement layer for normal citizens while eth mainnet will be used by states/ state layers and big institutions (I wish it was different/ that I’m wrong re eth mainnet, but let’s capitalize on it). We have the chance to establish a truly neutral governance structure for the people, which can be easily interacted with. We should take that chance!
Sample Voting Issue 1:
In its current form I’d vote against the proposal.
Every project-allocation in a decentralized organization is an educated guess on the result/ profitability. If the risk/result profile is favorable, the contributors should entrust the grantees with funding.
In this case we have good Action Points, but we have too many trade-offs on the softs. Mainly accountability and transparence (and using yield for calculations lol), making it unfavorable in my view.
You could change it up by creating a UNI contributor native task group and inviting delegates of Flipside to revise it in UNIs interest. “Centralized” working groups focussed on specific tasks are not a problem though.
On a sidenote: Most Ivy University groups have a history of grifting crypto (#education-fund).
Sample Voting Issue 2:
I’d like to cut this answer short by saying that consciously perceived risk (i.e. apeing into a strategy that uses a new farm with high yields despite disclaimers) should not be reimbursed, while it is in the interest of the protocol to re-establish trust if infrastructure breaks where it wasn’t supposed to break, given a normal third party risk evaluation. I think Yearn has good reimbursement practices.

Sample Voting Issue 1:

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The major purpose of a DAO is supporting real decentralization, development and health of the Arbitrum rollup. DAO members should focus on technical support, governance participation, supporting infrastructure, tooling, Improving protocol decentralization to encourage the development of a Arbitrum ecosystem and ARB token in particular. Health and long-term sustainability of such a great project as Arbitrum shoul be in focus during any voting steps of all DAO members who are interested in Arbitrum further success.
If Arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.

To support system stability and health as well as to function efficiently in the long term, delegation of voting power is crucial for any DAO.

I would separate the grants into ½ year or better quarterly distributions. It is especially important for large grants. Smooth money allocation makes process less stressful.

One of the major problems for all DAOs is centralization/effectiveness dilemma: decisions are ultimately dependent on the DAOs’ members approval but sometimes it may be a stack for effective but non popular decision. Anyway, I am always on the side of DAO and decentralization.

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

Split Reimbursement

Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reimbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reimbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors. 3 A full reimbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reimbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

After reading the entire plan, I think it is very good. The design of the plan is very innovative. The entire implementation plan has also been designed layer by layer, trying to be decentralized and transparent. First of all, it is beneficial to Dao to achieve risk control and cost savings as much as possible, and to take into account ecosystem development and project maintenance. Secondly, the executive countypart is designed as a coordinated and stable anti-risk organization which is also designed to be decentralized, transparent and controllable as much as possible to reduce the probability and cost of making mistakes. Finally, the purpose of the whole scheme is to serve the ecosystem, the project itself and DAO. So my position is to support the proposal. As we know,the starting point of decentralization and transparency is for the better development of the project, and the relative centralization (sometimes there is no better choice) is also to promote the healthy development of the project and the ecosystem.

Contract loopholes lead to the theft of user assets. The first thing to do is to recover the loss. If it cannot be recovered, it is necessary to repay the user’s funds. Users believe in the product and believe that the developer of the product is responsible, so they choose to put funds on the product platform. In the event of users losses due to hacker attacks, the responsible party is responsible for solving the problem. I am in favor of full repayment.While this is not the responsibility of the user, the only responsibility of the user is to believe in the product too much.

Main goals of DAOs
 Decentralization:
The DAOs as it states on its name are Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. They provide the decentralization by creating an organization of individuals opposing authority. The decisions that will be made are getting decided by each one of the parties of that organization rather than an authority containing several people. By this way, a democratic and decentralized system is being made and therefore, bring out one of the main goals of the DAOs which is decentralization.
 Publicity
All the votes that were done on the chain are always visible to the others which makes a DAO more trustworthy as well as clear. Publicity is one of the key points for a DAO not only because of that but also it makes the voters be heard publicly and could give them reputation which will end up making them feel valued. Since the voters can also see other votes as well, it will also make them trust the DAO even more and it will make the DAO more eligible. Therefore the publicity is one of the main goals of DAOs since it benefits the participants as well as the DAO and creates a more trustful system.
 Association/ Community
The concept of DAOs are based on organizations which will eventually help people all around the world to come together and create an association and community in some way. By encouraging people to come together and create a shared vision, DAOs empower individuals and facilitate connections with like-minded people.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
How would you vote?
 Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
The proposal should limit the centralized authority of Flipside by proportioning the amounts that are going to be transferred to Flipside as well as expanding the seats on the allocations and focus on checking the overall steps to make sure to not give in too much authority into one centralized unit.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Considering the ability to get things done for being more important than decentralization is against the very first objective of the DAOs. DAOs, as it mentions on its name, are Decentralized Autonomous Organizations which means their primary focus is on being decentralized. Getting things done is also remarkably important however in order for it to be done properly, decentralization should be secured primarily. Even though at the end, Uniswap ended up attracting new users, the way it was done is against the idea of decentralization and it was done for Uniswap’s own profit. Considering that it was on behalf of Uniswap it also contradicts the idea that a DAOs main objective should be the diversity of opinions as well as decisions and the participants of the organization, not a small group of people as the authority. Overall, even though attracting new users are important, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program thus will eventually lead up to the system being centralized which in fact, contradicts with the main objectives of DAOs.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
 Split Reimbursement
The logic of reimbursement is based on trust and value. Those companies that guarantee reimbursement in situations like getting hacked, make the people who choose them feel valued and safe to trust the company no matter what since they know that they will end up with a reimbursement.
Even though it seems ethically acceptable for the companies to reimburse those affected in a situation where the company gets hacked, there is an opposition to that idea. Always expecting a refund from all the actions individuals take is not possible when it comes to blockchain. Because blockchain in general has never been something that excluded all the risks. By taking an action whether it is trading, delegating, staking etc. you are also accepting the risks beforehand including the possibility of being hacked.
However, there is another criterion to consider before deciding on the reimbursement and it is the precautions that have been taken beforehand by the company. If the company did not come up with significant security precautions and is not safe enough, then the company itself is also responsible for the money that was taken down from the people. Which will also be an opposing idea on the argument before. The company itself is not separated from the result of being hacked and many people losing money. Just like individuals, companies are also responsible for anticipating possible risks, the company is also responsible to take the necessary actions for those possible upcoming situations. This leads to the idea of split reimbursement. Reimbursement itself is a trust-providing act just as mentioned above. Nevertheless, in a situation where a company gets hacked and people become affected by that, the best possible decision to make is to give split reimbursement to the parties.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Since we closely follow the developments in decentralized protocols on blockchains, we can understand what is beneficial for the users. We want to help users who cannot follow these processes but have voting power to use this power correctly. And of course, since we know that our main focus is on the same page, we want to contribute to the decentralization of Arbitrum.
Unlike other delegates, ITU Blockchain is located in Turkey, the country where Europe and Asia meet. This us the advantage of providing different perspectives from different cultures and natives, which will eventually benefit the decentralization of the DAOs. We have also noticed that most of the delegates so far are from the American region. Both ITU Blockchain being the delegate and the holders/stakers choosing us as the delegate will support the diversity of ideas.
To further promote decentralization and association, an authorized team from our community will regularly follow the Arbitrum governance forums and inform the rest of the community (who are approximately 2500 members) when voting is required. Once we’re accepted into the delegation, we’ll hold small meetings on governance voting to get our community’s opinions. Ultimately, we will cast our vote according to the collective decision of the community.
To sum up, We think that a decentralized protocol will come to a much better point by being managed with the opinions and suggestions of different communities. Since ITU Blockchain comes from both Europe and Asia, unlike other delegates, different perspectives will be put together and these perspectives will develop Arbitrum.",435

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
DAOs aim to promote decentralization, transparency, and community-driven decision-making, with the goal of creating a more democratic and efficient system of governance. They enable members to participate in the decision-making process, contribute to the success of the organization, and share in the rewards. Ultimately, the specific goals of a DAO will depend on its purpose and the needs of its members.
We can start investigating the various roles that the DAO might play in the larger Arbitrum ecosystem from this question, as well as the careful balancing act that comes with each choice.
These are but a few instances of DAO objectives; naturally, there are countless other things that may be done.
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Divide the funding into quarterly payments. I don’t think it’s a good idea to simply divide a 25 million dollar allocation between years 1 and 2.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Effectiveness and decentralisation will always be inversely correlated. This is a crucial instrument for the evolution of the DAO, provided that the centralised entities continue to ultimately depend on the DAO’s approval and run as transparently as feasible.
A DAO should only think about establishing centralising points when specialists must act rapidly and intelligently, which may be difficult for the Vox Populi of the DAO. Of course, trusted people of the space should perform this.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how might you decide to deal with this present circumstance?
If it’s not too much trouble, expound on what occasions you accept it is on the whole correct to discount and which are not.
i.e should parties be repaid for an endeavor or not? (If it’s not too much trouble, pick one of the beneath choices and afterward elaborate upon your thinking)
Part Repayment
Hacks and loss of assets are right up 'til now quite possibly of the most grounded blocker we have from individuals confiding in the space and onboarding onto it. Each time a huge depleting of convention contracts happens, the possibility of the Monetary Legos gets undermined, as individuals become less and less able to risk interfacing with different conventions.
Consequently, I accept essentially a halfway reinbursement is dependably to be looked at when as a convention has chosen to help out you. These gatherings chose to endow the security of your brilliant agreements, and their devotion and trust that was put onto the convention ought to be said thanks to by basically attempting to give a few subsidizes back. Later on, this really might be taken care of with DAO protection conventions, which are as of now being created in the space.
Notwithstanding, I would be reluctant to give a full reinbursement when the hack has seriously affected the convention so severely. In the event that the sum won’t have that a very remarkable effect on the main concern it’s a good idea to give a reinbursement, however in this specific case the twofold effect of the hack was serious to the point that this lead to one of the principal occasions of a DAO expressly shutting entryways. 6 A full reinbursement , regarding influence, would be equivalent to a second similarly wrecking hack.
TL;DR Give sufficient pay to thank the members for participating in the framework, however while a full reinbursement could help these partners, the effect of this activity could prompt the DAO entering an adverse demise winding.

Please provide your perspective on the overall objectives for the DAO:   The primary focus of Arbitrum DAO should be to facilitate and empower communities and DAOs on the Arbitrum platform to realize their ambitions. We should offer top-notch assistance as a DAO, which includes employing the DAO’s resources to welcome and aid new projects in both technical development and community integration, increasing awareness for existing projects, and fostering incentives for P2P networks to flourish autonomously without relying on centralized entities like exchanges.
Please share your thoughts on previous issues raised in other communities, as detailed below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Vote: Opposed
Proposal amendments:


Reallocate committee seats to guarantee a more equitable representation, incorporating involvement from various analytics service providers.


Set forth unambiguous guidelines and measures for transparency to prevent conflicts of interest or bias.


Approach to balancing centralization of authority and operational efficiency:
My goal is to strike a balance between centralization and decentralization, capitalizing on the effectiveness of centralized decision-making while guaranteeing that power is equitably dispersed among numerous stakeholders. This could include implementing checks and balances, rotating duties, and adopting transparent procedures.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Situation handling:
Option: 3. Partial Reimbursement
In this circumstance, I would opt for Partial Reimbursement. By compensating affected parties for a fraction of their losses, we recognize the consequences of the exploit while promoting more diligent risk management among users. It’s essential to assess each situation individually, taking into account factors such as the exploit’s nature, the extent of carelessness, and the overall impact on the community.
Instances when reimbursement is suitable:

When the exploit results from a glaring oversight or negligence by the project team.
When impacted users adhered to the best security practices, and the exploit was unpredictable.

Instances when reimbursement is unsuitable:

When users knowingly participated in high-risk activities or ignored security advisories.
When compensating users would endanger the project’s overall stability or viability.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

DAO should take an aggressive approach in promoting liquidity mining, as it can help increase the total amount of liquidity mining and provide funding for public services related to it. Decentralized management and transparency can also enhance the efficiency and security of liquidity mining, reduce concerns about fund security, and increase investor confidence. The overall goal of DAO is to support the development and progress of liquidity mining, help users solve problems, support developers, and improve governance processes, among other things. By achieving these goals, DAO can make a significant contribution to the entire ecosystem and promote its sustainable growth.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
1.How would you vote?

Against

2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Reduce Flipside’s control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program. For example, Flipside only has one seat on the allocation committee and one seat on the Oversight committee, instead of three and one respectively.
Involve other analytics service providers in the proposal to ensure a fair and competitive selection process. This could help prevent the favoritism of one service provider and promote a more diverse ecosystem.
Increase transparency and communication with the community about the program’s goals, guidelines, and progress. This can help build trust among investors and ensure that the program aligns with Uniswap’s values and vision.
Overall, the amendments would aim to ensure a more decentralized, transparent, and competitive process for attracting new users to Uniswap through bounties while mitigating concerns about centralization and favoritism towards one service provider.

3.How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

In my opinion, a decentralized approach is crucial for promoting transparency, fairness, and community involvement in decision-making. However, complete decentralization can lead to inefficiencies and a lack of direction. Therefore, finding the right balance between centralization and decentralization is key. This can be achieved by establishing clear guidelines and procedures for decision-making, ensuring representation from different stakeholders, and promoting open communication and collaboration among all parties involved. Additionally, implementing a system of checks and balances can help prevent any one party from gaining too much control or authority. Ultimately, striking a balance between centralization and decentralization requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach that takes into account the specific needs and goals of the organization or community.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

I choose option 3 - Split Reimbursement.


While it is important to have measures in place to reimburse those who have suffered losses from exploits, I am cautious about full reimbursement as it may create a moral hazard. In cases where the loss is small and the number of victims is limited, full reimbursement may be appropriate as it can help to restore confidence in the system. However, when the loss is significant, it is important to exercise caution and provide some buffer space to prevent a spiral of decline in the entire financial system. Split reimbursement strikes a balance between compensating victims for their losses and mitigating the risks of moral hazard and systemic instability.

Reduce the overall grant.
Ask the Uniswap community a list of potential candidates for this kind of grants.
Impose a stricter framework regarding how the funds could be spent by the grantee.
Vest the grant over 12mo and give an upfront funding representing 30% of the total grant.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Initially, a certain level of centralization might be required for swift decision-making and promoting development. However, as the platform evolves and attracts a robust community, moving towards a more decentralized governance structure becomes crucial. This gradual shift towards decentralization grants the community a say in the decision-making process and guarantees a variety of viewpoints. Achieving this balance ensures efficient decision-making while upholding the foundational principles of decentralization, resulting in a resilient and adaptable platform.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
No Reimbursement. As we saw with the ending of the Rari project, a DAO can’t be an insurance fund and at the same time the project’s treasury. Liquidity is a huge obstacle to accomplish that and every user was clearly warned that there might be high risk to use their platform. Everyone should take their responsibilities and don’t assume someone will save them if something breaks.

No amendments, just cancel it altogether.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Split Reimbursement

The decision of whether to reimburse parties affected by an exploit is complex and depends on the specific circumstances of each case. In the case of the FEI RARI hack, I would vote for splitting the reimbursement. Splitting reimbursement can help to prevent a sudden influx of funds from destabilizing the community or market, which could have negative consequences for all participants.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The purpose of a DAO is to enable the healthy and decentralized development of the rollup, encompassing technical and security aspects as well as promoting ecosystem growth and ARB token adoption. The DAO’s decisions should focus on the long-term sustainability and success of the rollup and its ecosystem.
The DAO could assume various roles within the Arbitrum ecosystem to achieve this goal, each requiring a careful balancing act. For instance, a technical subcommittee could oversee protocol and security upgrades and report to the broader DAO. Similarly, liquidity mining can drive short-term growth and user acquisition, but it should not be seen as a permanent fixture and should not subsidize protocols through unsustainable emissions. Grants can target builders and support the development of tools and dApps that might not be profitable but are needed by the space.
These are just a few examples of the many possibilities for DAO goals and roles within the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
-Fоr-
Delegation of voting power is necessary for a DAO to function efficiently in the long term, as long as there are sufficient accountability measures and the delegation does not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO.
Regarding the proposal, I would suggest separating the grants into quarterly distributions rather than just dividing them into Year 1 and Year 2. This would provide more flexibility and increase accountability. Additionally, introducing routine votes would ensure that the DAO is still comfortable with such a large allocation and encourage grantee accountability.
When it comes to the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, effectiveness and decentralization are inevitably inversely proportional. However, centralizing points can be necessary when specialists are required to act quickly and knowledgeably. The entities chosen for this role should be trusted members of the space, and the DAO should maintain ultimate control and transparency.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reimbursement
How would you handle this situation outside of flipping the vote?
In terms of handling the situation outside of flipping the vote, it depends on the specifics of the situation. One approach could be to thoroughly investigate the issue and gather input from community members before making a decision. It’s important to ensure that all parties affected are heard and that the decision made aligns with the overall goals and values of the DAO.
Regarding refunds for exploits, it’s a complex issue. Generally speaking, refunds may be appropriate in situations where the exploit was due to a flaw or vulnerability in the system that was not easily preventable, and where the party affected did not engage in malicious behaviour. However, refunds should not be given in situations where the party intentionally exploited the system or engaged in fraudulent behaviour. Ultimately, any decision regarding refunds should prioritize the long-term health and sustainability of the DAO and its ecosystem.
Split Reimbursement
Partial reimbursement should be considered when a protocol experiences a hack or loss of funds to show gratitude to parties that entrusted the security of their smart contracts. However, full reimbursement may not be appropriate when the hack severely impacted the protocol. While compensation should be provided, a full reimbursement could lead to a negative death spiral. DAO insurance protocols could be developed in the future to handle these situations.

Furthermore, ParaSwap has been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme recipients, and if needed, another DAO member can act as ParaSwap’s representative to avoid any significant conflict of interest. Overall, I believe that the growth of any decentralized rollup on the Ethereum ecosystem benefits the entire space, and I will leverage my expertise to advance it.",446

Hello! Ross here - one of the co-founders of the rhino DeFi project. Rhino (PKA DeversiFi) was the first DeFi project to launch on a rollup, and we have been building every since. Rhino launched on Arbitrum in 2022 and supports frictionless bridging between chains & L2’s as well as cross-chain swapping.
The areas I am most interested in:
Public Goods funding
DeFi development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation
DAO Goals:
The goals of the DAO should be to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem, support stakeholders (both builders and users) and to safeguard the long term decentralization & independence of the DAO-run rollups (there may be many L2s, L3s and app-chains in the Arbitrum ecosystem).
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Against (in its current form)
I truly believe that most organizations in the space act in good faith, but it is important to demonstrate value for money and adequate oversight of any DAO spending - for the benefit of the entire community. Allocating public good funding should be staggered, with clear milestones and audits to demonstrate proper delivery. Grants should always start small and then grow over time (if needed) as partners demonstrate the proper control and competence. Less oversight is needed for smaller allocations, but for larger allocations should be policed properly. The DAO should vote for various controls that are needed for different levels of spending.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Against (in its current form)
Compensation is always a balancing act. A balance needs to be struck between the long term survival of the protocol, and reimbursing users. I am a big believer in ensuring that the everyday person is compensated first and made whole as a matter of priority - those smaller users are the lifeblood of crypto, and they are the people who ultimately DeFi as a whole is building towards. Large users should be compensated over a longer time period, to encourage their retained support of the protocol - but their payout should be partially dependent on the growth of the protocol. At the same time, the protocol must not be starved of the funds that are needed to grow and innovate. For example, larger users could have a greater share of protocol fees at higher levels of protocol revenue.
Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
No conflicts of interest. Rhino.fi has been building on L2 since 2020 and has a track record of always doing the right thing - from bailing-out smaller users after the Terra/Luna collapse, to providing a gas-free platform that shelters users from high gas prices.
I look forward to building with you!

DeFi development on Arbitrum


Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization


Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Arbitrum’s DAO principles should be centered around decentralization, transparency, and community-driven decision-making. The DAO is meant to empower users and stakeholders to participate in the governance of the network, propose and vote on changes to the protocol, and incentivize contributions that improve the overall health of the network.
I believe the overall goals for Arbitrum’s DAO could be:

To ensure the decentralization and security of the network: The DAO should aim to maintain a decentralized network that is resistant to attacks and censorship. Especially given the recent coordinated against crypto banking network, it’s very important to be decentralized and not succumb to demands by centralized entities such as governments or corporations.
To foster a thriving community of developers and users: The DAO should incentivize contributions from developers and users by rewarding them for improving the network’s functionality and usability.
To enable community-driven decision-making: The DAO should allow community members to propose and vote on changes to the network, ensuring that decisions are made in a transparent and democratic manner.

Voting Issue 1:


I vote against the proposal. It is  a good idea to have an analytics service provider like Flipside involved to provide valuable insights into user behavior and market trends. However, the concern over the centralization of power and favor of one service provider does not align with mine or the DAO’s goals of decentralization.


To address this issue, amendments could be made to the proposal to ensure that other analytics service providers are also involved in the program. This would help to promote decentralization and ensure that different perspectives are taken into account.


In terms of the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, it is important to strike a balance between the two. While having a centralized authority can be efficient, it can also lead to a concentration of power and a lack of diversity in decision-making. On the other hand, decentralization can be slow and inefficient but can promote a more democratic and inclusive process. I would lean more on the decentralization side and have a healthy blockchain that isn’t partial to a particular group and consequently have a slower but steady pace of getting things done to improve the blockchain.


Voting Issue 2:
I would support full reimbursement as it can help restore confidence and prevent a loss of value for those affected. It can also be viewed as a way to uphold the principles of decentralization, as it distributes the cost of the exploit across the community rather than burdening a single individual or entity. If the DAO’s primary goal is to protect and maintain the integrity of the blockchain and support decentralization, then I see supporting full reimbursement for the RARI hack as a way to achieve that goal.

There is a fine balance to be had deciding whether to go centralisation and ability to get things done. It is always best to get things done when in critical situation as something even the smallest of things can become a major talking point when discussed at length,
Issue 2 - I would do with full reimbursement if the companies finances can sustain it. It is always better for the entity to not lose the confidence of its consumers, If they were exploited and the clients were not reimbursed then the future clients would lose confidence which will affect the future trade

Goals for the DAO:
Mainly making decisions that benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem in all its extension, pursuing specific objectives, with decentralization and security as flags. Finance and facilitate the exploration and innovation of projects, preserving the standards of the ecosystem and its community.
Issue 1

For
Reduce the amount of location for a single party. Saying that decentralization is the way and then giving so much power to just one? Not only is it shady in this case but it contradicts.
Clearly in this case the problem is that someone was not liking the decisions made by the governance. Beyond that, I think the need for the founder to have the ability to intervene in extremely compromising decisions is important.

Issue 2

Full Reimbursement. If party can actually proves that the hack had taken place. Meaning that if the failure was found in the governance contract, it would have to be reimbursed, but if the failure is due to a mismanagement of a party’s own security, then there should not be a full refund

Liquidity Mining attract more users, but it only benefits the early investors. As more users comes in, it reduces the amount of yield for late investors while the early miners got a ton of rewards to dump into the new users. Most of the time, the people who controls the large number of tokens, dictates the outcome of any proposal. May it be good or bad for the over all health of the ecosystem.

Sample Voting Issue 1:

No amendments, it should have been rejected in the first place.
Have a senate voted people, who have identities known to all users. They can be the last people to double check that the governance vote is properly executed. And a vote should be a token-weight voting.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
For reimbursements, it should be stated if where the funds would come from. If the token holders or participants were to pay for this, then its a NO for me. But If this is a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reimbursing into the damaged parties’ accounts, my vote is YES.
Another option is to have a partial reimbursement to all parties affected, atleast everyone takes a haircut, as we all know that investing in crypto is risky. And hacks are part of it.

What area I am most interested in contributing to?

Improving Governance participation and effectiveness- with emphasis on the best quality (not just quantity)
DeFi development on Arbitrum (not developer or very technical, but more philosophy of economy, game theory, etc.).
Supporting Infrastructure (Mix of related aspects: LP, bounty hunting, supporting education and spreading the word about Arbi, etc.).
IRL Arbitrum community gatherings
Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

share my stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First, I love how your actions and this process support the vision of decentralization through teaching, experiencing and creating change. This is truly important.
I think it’s amazing educating and onboarding new quality users! One thing- I think we should use the gamification/motivation aspect. My suggestion- make use of gamified task managers such as GALXE/CRUE3/etc format also on this matter- DAO missions and learning. New users coming every day starting from 0.
The goals of the DAO as I see it:
I think it’s a process with the vision of an optimized end game- which will be a truly decentralized ecosystem, working efficiently like a beehive, with some aspects that can be handled by a centralized entity and oversighted by the DAO and different mechanisms . The main question should be- how this helps our hive (protocol/ecosystems and purring to the individuals).
Liquidity mining (APY for staked ARBI), is a MUST imo. Ignoring the legal terms, tokens are in some ways like Stocks of companies (in Decentralized protocols/organizations only) which means dividends/profit sharing model is normal. How to do that on Blockchain/Arb token- 2 basic options: 1. Burn tokens (from yield/revenue) and by that split the yield and value between all token holders no matter the support and involvement in the ecosystem. 2. Give stakers APY for locking tokens (and by that can help to: price stability, liquidity, security in some ways, etc).
There is an option/operating space for a mix of the 2 options,- split the revenues from protocol. For example: burn 10% of the yield/profits (protecting from inflation++) + 35% to stakers + 20% to treasury + 20% Grants, 1.5% self insurance +10% allocation of our projected infrastructure costs…
Sample Voting Issue 1:
1. My vote?
For
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I am not sure here… Allocation Committee- I would consider striving for 2/7 and lower, managed by UNI affiliates. Oversight Committee- would love to see with time more representatives outside of the UNI ecosystem(atm 2/3).
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I do see it as a new country being established- striving for full democracy, but at the moment being more centralized to get things done and make sure DAO is up and running in most efficient way .this means that I do think and believe DAO’s can be also very efficient- Just like a perfect healthy beehive, but it takes time to get there and change systems/beliefs/habits 
But for the present time, it is true, so must have ,at list at the beginning, creating mechanisms to support centralized operations in needed cases accompanied with checks and balances in place (from oversight, limiting membership in counsels in time, having a “real world smart contract” mechanism to prevent miss-conduct, rules on how to manage Conflict(s) of Interest, etc.).
Sample Voting Issue 2:
1. How would you vote?
Split Reimbursement
2. Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
In principal IMO we/ARBI must have self insurance fund- generated from the yield as it is planned. I went for this option for few reasons:

Backing the broader community is a value and support trust.
Taking responsibility on the ecosystem.
It happened long ago- physiologically getting back also 0.6 cent on the dollar is better than nothing and shows both insure-less parties (which knew the risks) took some hit.
The hack has severely impacted the protocol so badly that It is 100% Reimbursement of losses and less about the opportunity to save both users and protocol/ecosystem that will bring more value in the future.
Suggestion: I would support Reimbursement that will give small amount now and the rest from the future self-insurance fund that I believe will be able to support this model with minimum impact.

Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO:
In terms of liquidity mining, I believe that it may be beneficial for a DAO to incentivize ecosystem growth indirectly by applying to different protocols rather than directly through liquidity mining. For example, Optimism has brought diverse uses to its network by incentivizing its usability and ecosystem. As for the DAO’s goals, I believe that diversity of opinions and participants should be the primary objective. If a small group centralizes power, the name DAO becomes meaningless. To increase diversity against personal interests, creating committees and delimiting their membership from the beginning may be helpful.
Regarding the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, I believe that committees or delegates can fulfill the vital function of representing the voice of many and optimizing governance processes while maintaining decentralization.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
How would you vote? Against.
What amendments would you make to the proposal, if any? To prioritize diversity of opinions and participants, committees should be created from the beginning, and the number of members should be specified to increase diversity and prevent a small group from centralizing power.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Split Reimbursement. In cases where a hack has occurred, a DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and consider their survival. Instead of literally draining funds, I believe it would be best to return money to those affected, potentially under a vesting system, or for the DAO to actively work to protect the interests of its users.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The broader goal of the Arbitrum Foundation DAO should be a multifaceted approach that seeks to:

Build a sustainable ecosystem with all material decisions being made while considering the medium and long term impacts to the health and growth of Arbitrum’s technology, economy, and community;
Deploy unparalleled and uncompromising security measures – all decisions should be made by the DAO without compromising the Ethereum security layer which Arbitrum is built on top of; and
Promote innovation, interoperability, and best-in-class user experience for the benefit of all users, protocols, builders, projects, and members of the Arbitrum community.

Sample Voting Issue 1

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

1. How would you vote?
For
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Prior to casting a “For” vote – I would seek clarify from UNI and Flipside to determine if Flipside is qualified and capable of being in a position of outsized influence in UNI’s bounty program. It is possible that Flipside has the necessary qualifications and experience to be able to efficiently steer the committees and drive the most value to the protocol and wider ecosystem.
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
DAO governance is inherently challenging because the leaders of the community must seek to strike a delicate balance between empowering and nurturing a thoughtful, collaborative, and engaged community (i.e., decentralizing the authority) and putting the proper individuals in roles that allow for the execution of the business plan and strategy adopted by the community (i.e., getting things done)

FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

Full Reimbursement

When considering whether or not exploited funds should be reimbursed there are a number of considerations:

Was the exploit due to the failure of the base layer of the platform (e.g., a critical failure in the technology hosting the platform that enabled the exploit)?
How impactful is the exploit to the overall health and security of the entire ecosystem?
Does the exploit materially damage the ongoing innovation, competition, and negatively impact the larger ecosystem community?

In cases where the exploit originated in the base layer of the platform, materially impacts the health and security of the ecosystem, or extinguishes the innovation and competition within the ecosystem, exploited funds should be refunded.
If an exploit originated due to a weak link in a protocol contract and was an isolated event, I think reimbursement should be on a case-by-case basis due to individual facts and circumstances (e.g., what actions has the team taken to cure the breach, what was the goal of the protocol, did they have significant user adoption and/or were they on their way to becoming a cornerstone of the ecosystem).

How aggressive should we be in liquidity mining?
Arbitrum has experienced steady and consistent growth, already accruing a large TVL. Therefore, a measured approach being careful not to front-load incentives too heavily initially, would provide more ammo for future adjustments while not allowing airdrop farmers to extract all the value from the Arbitrum ecosystem.
What is the goal of the DAO?
Empowering the community through crypto-economic incentives for alignment in developing and creating a more accessible blockchain should be the DAO’s goal. Discourse should be open, transparent, and inclusive. Furthermore, decentralization is paramount and should be prioritized only second to the chain’s security.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
1. Against.
2. My amendment would limit Flipside to having only two seats, ensuring the community has the majority say. In addition, the council would not include any blockchain clubs. Such clubs tend to vote in unison based on ideological principles without bearing the consequences of their decisions.
I acknowledge that blockchain clubs can bring valuable knowledge and perspectives to decision-making processes related to blockchain technology. My previous statement should not be interpreted as advocating for their exclusion from the process. Rather, I believe it’s important to maintain checks and balances on their influence to ensure fair representation and decision-making within the community.
3. For effective decision-making, it is important to ensure that those in positions of power are held accountable through appropriate checks and balances. One way to achieve this is by diversifying the centralized authorities in charge, which can help to establish and reinforce those checks and balances within the decision-making process. By distributing power more widely, decision-making can become more transparent, inclusive, and reflective of the interests and perspectives of the broader community.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - FEI RARI Hack
1. Full reimbursement.
It is advisable for protocols to establish insurance funds to mitigate the impact of bugs in their code. Although it may not be feasible to provide a full reimbursement of 100 cents on the dollar in every case, protocols should strive to compensate those affected to the best of their ability within the framework of their proposed insurance fund structure. This approach can help to safeguard users and ensure the stability and reliability of the protocol in the long term.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralized development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security-focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encourage the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’.
From this question, we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem and the careful balancing act that follows each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitral truly wants to be community-owned, they need to have oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist in the short-term growth and user acquisition of the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidized too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees take the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.

These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course, there are endless possibilities for what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralization, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

How would you approach the tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Effectiveness and decentralization are inevitably inversely proportional. As long as the centralized entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralizing points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reimbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reimbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reimbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reimbursement, but in this particular case, the double impact of the hack was so severe that this led to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors. A full reimbursement, in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provides enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system. Still, while a full reimbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.
Languages I speak and write: By order of preference - English,  French
Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralization of liquidity in the roll-up by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionally, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which, although part of the wider Ethereum ecosystem, could be considered a conflict of interest. Currently, I am being allocated ~ 1k OP. In addition to this, ParaSwap has also been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme recipients, and if necessary, the representative of ParaSwap could be a different DAO member if this is considered a major conflict of interest. I believe that the growth of any decentralized rollup on the Ethereum ecosystem is a net positive for everyone in the space, and I will do my best to lend my knowledge to better the entire space ",470

One amendment that could be made is to reduce the number of seats that Flipside has on the allocation committee and the Oversight committee. This could be done by increasing the number of seats for other analytics service providers or by having a more balanced representation of seats on the committees. Another amendment could be to have a more transparent process for allocating UNI to bounties and for the oversight of the entire program. This could help to address concerns about the centralization of power and the favor of one service provider.

My aim as a potential representative for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain is to advance the community's advancement and ensure fair representation for all members. To accomplish this, I recommend that the DAO concentrate on programs that enhance liquidity and engage a broad range of stakeholders.
Despite the potential benefits of liquidity mining, I suggest proceeding with caution and considering long-term implications. Rather than focusing solely on short-term gains, the DAO’s top priority should be to establish a sturdy and self-sustaining environment that can withstand market volatility and adjust to evolving circumstances.
<Sample Voting Issue 1>

I oppose the current Uniswap proposal. Although bounties can be an excellent method for luring new users to the platform, I find the proposal problematic because it grants them excessive control over the allocation of UNI and the administration of the program. This could result in an unfair advantage for the team and the centralization of power.

<Sample Voting Issue 2>

I maintain that the Rari hack reimbursement matter is multifaceted and necessitates thoughtful examination and a nuanced strategy. While I empathize with the individuals who suffered as a result of the attack, I believe it is crucial to meticulously evaluate the potential advantages and disadvantages of any reimbursement action.

Split Reimbursement

Hacking is like a natural disaster to a community. I think compensating for this is akin to spending taxes on the amount of disaster damage. In fact, it is scary to imagine that the community is depressed due to hacking damage and that it affects the price impact of other tokens.
However, it is true that aggressive compensation is also quite burdensome. Therefore, Split Reimbursement should be considered, and it would be nice to have community participation and a culture of censoring and sharing safe contracts in advance.

Improving Governance participation
Supporting Infrastructure
Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Sample Voting Issue :
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

NFT development on Arbitrum
Gaming development on Arbitrum


Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

This blockchain-based tool; Arbitrum provides multiple benefits to users who want to create smart contracts. It provides extra protection and transparency that are not offered by other platforms currently in use. The platform is also open source and provides a decentralized development environment that is fast and easy to learn. Additionally, the platform is adaptable enough to meet the requirements of developers and the apps they create and provides a high level of security with the snark consensus system. DAO’s are advantageous for new decentralized protocols that offer token holders decision-making authority rather than shareholders who are subject to no economic pressure. Due to its much healthier structure, this platform with its many benefits could become economically profitable.
If I were to alter the plan, I would add more details regarding the platform’s scalability, increase the number of resources available to developers who use the platform, and give developers more technical support. Finally, I suggest looking into ways to make the tool accessible to developers of all skill levels. In order to balance the trade-off between centralized authority and the capacity to get things done, I would place a higher priority on developing a secure and dependable platform while allowing for some degree of decentralization.Combining technical tools like consensus protocols with governance models that ensure the platform’s accountability, openness, and responsibility could achieve this. Additionally, I would make sure that all users are informed of any platform changes or updates in advance, and I would create a feedback and communication loop to ensure that any problems are dealt with as soon as they arise.
Overall, I strongly agree that our utilization and capacities are higher and costs are reduced significantly compared to the Ethereum network. The Layer2 technology used to scale and allow all these transactions off the chain is completely optimized and throughout this process we are seeing great security and decentralization, which is what the market needs and wants.
Many decentralized protocols employ the well-liked tactic of “liquidity mining” to encourage users to contribute liquidity and increase platform usage. While it may work well to draw in new users and stimulate commerce, it may also raise some issues that need to be carefully considered and dealt with. One worry is that the rewards from liquidity mining could inflate token values and draw speculators rather than long-term users by stimulating an artificial demand for the tokens. Additionally, because liquidity mining programs are expensive, they may produce emission rates that are too high, leading to long-term inflation and a decline in the token’s worth. Long-term achievement and sustainability are my main priorities. Although the idea of liquidity mining appeals to me somewhat, I am wary of it and carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of any programs. We can promote wholesome growth and adoption of Arbitrum while reducing the risks connected with these incentives by adopting thoughtful and well-designed liquidity mining programs.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

Every Dao must be decentralized in order to succeed because centralization could result in power misuse. The trade-off between power centralization and the capacity for action is a complicated matter that calls for careful balancing.A Dao will be successful as long as those who are given voting power have the best interest of the Dao. Despite having various opinions, voters can work together to reach a decision that will be advantageous to the Dao.
One the one hand, the centralization of power can result in quicker decision-making, streamlined procedures, and more effective initiative execution. However, it can also result in a lack of accountability, a concentration of power, and decreased transparency.

Reimbursement of funds as a result of errors or other issues may have negative effects on image or be financially unstable. If the system wasn’t completely compromised, I would partially reimburse both sides. But in a situation of the other Reimbursement Should be carefully considered. to prevent wasting money after more significant harm had already been done. But I will never completely reimburse users for any lost money as a result of a hack. The purpose of compensation should be to restore users’ lost faith in the protocol as a result of the breach, as well as to primarily address the root of the hack and deal with anything that can lead to such damaging situations.

NFT development on Arbitrum
Gaming development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
DAOs goal is to sustain Arbitrum’s alignment with Ethereum’s fundamentals, optimising long term health of the Arbitrum ecosystem and allow community to participate in the future of the ecosystem. Freedom to participate for all engaged parties.
And for the mining example. Mining has usually two goals: 1. lock liquidity (even though it is inflationary over time), 2. gather attention of the community. Both of those can be solved in other ways, especially by creating products that directly use the token. I am both building one of such products (I’m Starving) and invested in projects that will (e.g. WINR).
Other than that I am a strong believer that Arbitrum is THE place for on-chain gaming to happen. I am actively building a game that will use Arbitrum and hope to develop here for a long time.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
I would vote against to the initial proposal.
I have just spent 3 hours thinking about this problem, reading the temperature check, proposal and discussions. While community created analytics are a great way of engaging people into valuable discussion (without data we just speculate), this proposal was not clear. The very first temperature check comment was to the point “That said, the incentives here are poorly aligned - Flipside is essentially asking for a $25m, interest-free loan to operate a proprietary hedge fund from which they take 0/50 fees.”
One part of the proposal that I could vote for, was hiring a qualified team that would work full time on creating public analytic tools and promoting UNI ecosystem.
My understanding is also that the proposal itself came from Flipside, not from the Uniswap community. That was a red flag right there.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralisation of authority and the ability to get things done? This question would be more relevant if the proposal made sense in the first place. But let’s ignore it and think more broadly. If we think bout DAO structure, it is not that far away from modern democracy. On one hand we have voters, on other we have en organ that executes. Power balance between the two depends on the situation. In war, you do not want to vote on every move of your army. It needs agility and to achieve that you need a centralized decision maker. That does not mean that the executor can’t or shouldn’t be open for wider discussion. They must. Similarly in DAOs. Members choose the direction, but there will be some delegates that act on that direction. On every step they can consult with the wider community, but they should also be able to feel the trust and be able to take decisions within their expertise. And the DAO can settle accounts on specific milestones.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
I guess a good overview is by Cobie: twitter.com/cobie/status/1537220039522545664 and by Babylon: medium.com/babylon-finance/babylon-emergency-response-to-the-fei-reimbursement-veto-480c910f507e and medium.com/babylon-finance/rari-hack-reimbursement-a47560999b9c
Going through their snapshot, I found FIP 106 (Make the community whole, 26M TRIBE, 75.03%) from May 13 2022, TIP-121b (Full Hack Payment, 104M TRIBE, 95.65%) from Sep 7 2022.
These were 3 months of silence in between. Main problem then was communication between the corps involved and community. In addition, just a week after the hack, Luna/Terra collapsed and brought the bear market. Many seasoned players in crypto space stepped out back then and took longer hiatus to clear their minds and emotions. I could believe here was a similar situation. However, that should not be an excuse for the lack of information.
This problem is complicated. The first vote was an off-chain snapshot. It showed very clearly that community wants to reimburse. The on-chain vote did veto it. This was supposedly influenced by founders of the DAO when they informed community about possible depeg. I kinda understand their position, because Luna/Terra crash happened just a week after the Fuse Exploit.
TIP-121 has also a very interesting discussion pointing at how there was inside trading before the vote, and the Fuse was lying about their intentions. I can’t confirm those but this would affect my vote.
I do not have full financial information about Tribe DAO to answer if there should be reimbursement or not. Informing the DAO about financials is super important. My understanding is that full reimbursement meant closing shop for them. And it is understandable that it was a hard time for founders.
That being said, the interest of the few founders should not be mistaken with the wellbeing of the community at large. I would vote for Full Reimbursement.

Hello! Ross here - one of the co-founders of the rhino DeFi project. Rhino (PKA DeversiFi) was the first DeFi project to launch on a rollup, and we have been building ever since. Rhino launched on Arbitrum in 2022 and supports frictionless bridging between chains & L2’s as well as cross-chain swapping.
The areas I am most interested in:
Public Goods funding
DeFi development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation
DAO Goals:
The goals of the DAO should be to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem, support stakeholders (both builders and users) and to safeguard the long term decentralization & independence of the DAO-run rollups (there may be many L2s, L3s and app-chains in the Arbitrum ecosystem).
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Against (in its current form)
I truly believe that most organizations in the space act in good faith, but it is important to demonstrate value for money and adequate oversight of any DAO spending - for the benefit of the entire community. Allocating public good funding should be staggered, with clear milestones and audits to demonstrate proper delivery. Grants should always start small and then grow over time (if needed) as partners demonstrate the proper control and competence. Less oversight is needed for smaller allocations, but for larger allocations should be policed properly. The DAO should vote for various controls that are needed for different levels of spending.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Against (in its current form)
Compensation is always a balancing act. A balance needs to be struck between the long term survival of the protocol, and reimbursing users. I am a big believer in ensuring that the everyday person is compensated first and made whole as a matter of priority - those smaller users are the lifeblood of crypto, and they are the people who ultimately DeFi as a whole is building towards. Large users should be compensated over a longer time period, to encourage their retained support of the protocol - but their payout should be partially dependent on the growth of the protocol. At the same time, the protocol must not be starved of the funds that are needed to grow and innovate. For example, larger users could have a greater share of protocol fees at higher levels of protocol revenue.
Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
No conflicts of interest. Rhino.fi has been building on L2 since 2020 and has a track record of always doing the right thing - from bailing-out smaller users after the Terra/Luna collapse, to providing a gas-free platform that shelters users from high gas prices.
I look forward to building with you!

The goal of the Arbitrum DAO should be to support the protocols in the Arbitrum ecosystem to foster capital attraction to Arbitrum as the dominant L2 network.

For example - how aggressive should we be in extracting liquidity, what is the goal of the DAO?
I believe that the main goal of DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem, which in turn will be able to withstand changes in the market as well as quickly navigate and be flexible.
The Arbitrum delegates, in my opinion, should contribute to the development of the community and maintain a healthy atmosphere. And the project itself should be rewarded and encouraged in every way possible.
As far as liquidity mining is concerned, we need to be careful and consider all the previous mistakes.
Of course, healthy communication with other communities will only give impetus to do something new, cool. It certainly won’t be superfluous.
As I said, we work as a “BAT” team and our team’s key loyalties are: transparency, trust, interests in making decisions for the good of the team, not just one person. Which is exactly what I would like to see in Arbitrum DAO.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Decentralization: DAOs are decentralized organizations that do not require a central authority to make decisions. This means that decisions made are based on a democratic process and that no one person or entity has complete control over the organization.
Automation: Thanks to blockchain technology, DAOs can automate many of their activities, such as fund management and identity verification. This reduces the need for intermediaries and associated costs, making the organization more efficient and transparent.
Transparency: Since DAOs use blockchain technology, all transactions and decisions made by the organization are public and transparent. This allows anyone to verify the organization’s activities and ensure that decisions made are fair and impartial.
Inclusion: DAOs are open to anyone with internet access and who wishes to participate. This allows people from all over the world to contribute to the organization and have a say, regardless of their geographical location or social status.
Resistance to censorship: Thanks to their decentralized nature, DAOs are resistant to censorship and external interference. This means that decisions made by the organization are based on the wishes of the majority of participants and cannot be influenced by a central authority or single person.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

How would you vote?
For

For any DAO to operate effectively over the long term, it’s necessary to delegate voting power. While this introduces a level of centralization, it can be a positive step as long as those with delegated power don’t control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and appropriate accountability measures are in place.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

To allocate an amount as large as 25 million, I believe it would be unwise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. While I understand that half of the allocation was intended for staff employment, delivering the entire reserve upfront seems unnecessary. Although delivering the funds once a year may save time on transactions and communication, it would be wiser to divide the allocation into quarterly distributions.
To ensure accountability throughout the delegation period, it would be beneficial to introduce routine votes in addition to having a committee handle immediate matters related to the grant. This would encourage the grantee to increase accountability and provide regular accountability reports, while also allowing the DAO to periodically assess its comfort level with such a large allocation.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

The relationship between effectiveness and decentralization is inevitably inverse. However, if centralized entities are still ultimately dependent on the approval of the DAO and operate transparently, it can be a necessary tool for the DAO’s development.
In cases where specialists are needed to act quickly and knowledgeably, which may be difficult for the DAO’s general membership, a DAO may consider having centralizing points. These entities should be trusted members of the space, of course.

Prompts to Answer:
The situation appears complex, as it has affected both individual victims and DAOs. I believe that providing FEI to individuals and DAI to DAOs seems unjust. A split should not be made. Furthermore, I disagree with the idea of compensating small balance victims more and large balance victims less. I think that everyone should receive an equal amount of compensation.

What area are you most interested in contributing to? choose up tot wo tags:
I’m interested in NFT development on Arbitrum and Gaming development on Arbitrum. NFTs are a hot topic in the crypto world, and there is a lot of interest in building NFT marketplaces and applications. If you have experience in web3 development and are passionate about NFTs, this could be an area to explore. Additionally, gaming is another area that is seeing a lot of growth in the blockchain space. If you are interested in game development and blockchain, building games on Arbitrum could be a good option.
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
On the overall goals for the DAO, I believe that we should prioritize building a strong and sustainable community while also driving adoption and increasing liquidity for our tokens. I think liquidity mining can be an effective tool to achieve these goals, but it should be used strategically and with a long-term perspective in mind. Ultimately, the goal of the DAO should be to create value for its members and contribute to the growth and success of the ecosystem.
Regarding Sample Voting Issue 1, I would have voted against the proposal as it gave too much control to one service provider and lacked diversity in its allocation and oversight committees. To address these issues, I would have proposed amendments that increase the number of seats on the committees and include other analytics service providers in the proposal. Additionally, I would have suggested a more balanced distribution of power among the committee members.
When approaching the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, I believe that it’s important to strike a balance. While centralized decision-making can sometimes lead to quicker and more efficient outcomes, it also poses a risk of bias and lack of diversity. Therefore, I would advocate for a decentralized approach that involves multiple stakeholders and allows for open discussion and collaboration.
Prompts to Answer:
As for how I would vote, I would vote against the proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that using Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties is a good idea, I have concerns about the level of control and oversight that Flipside would have over the program. Giving them such a large percentage of seats on the allocation and oversight committees, without any involvement from other analytics service providers, raises concerns about centralization of power and favoritism.
If I were to make amendments to the proposal, I would suggest reducing the number of seats on the allocation and oversight committees that Flipside would have. Instead, I would propose involving other analytics service providers to ensure that the allocation of UNI to bounties is fair and unbiased.
Regarding the tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, I believe that it is important to strike a balance. While having a centralized authority can help streamline decision-making and make it easier to get things done, it also has the potential to create a power imbalance and favoritism. In this case, I believe that the current proposal gives too much power to one service provider and therefore, am against it.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
I believe that parties affected by an exploit should be reimbursed to some extent. However, I think it’s important to carefully consider the details of each situation before making a decision on how much reimbursement is appropriate.
In the case of the FEI RARI hack, I would support a split reimbursement where affected parties receive a portion of their losses back. This allows for some compensation while also recognizing that a full reimbursement may not be feasible or fair to all parties involved.
In general, I believe that refunds should be provided when the exploit was not caused by the user’s own negligence or lack of security measures. However, it’s also important to consider the overall impact on the ecosystem and the precedent that a refund may set for future situations.
As for my conflicts of interest, I do not have any that would prevent me from using my best judgment to advance the Arbitrum ecosystem. I’m committed to contributing to the community and helping to make governance decisions that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.",503

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a seasoned DeFi and crypto professional, I believe the DAO should focus on creating a robust ecosystem that drives innovation in the DeFi and NFT spaces. It is essential for the DAO to strike a balance between aggressive liquidity mining and sustainable growth, prioritizing long-term value creation. The DAO should also actively support and fund projects that push the boundaries of what is possible on Arbitrum.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would propose a more decentralized allocation and oversight committee structure, ensuring that Flipside doesn’t hold a majority of seats. I’d also advocate for the inclusion of other analytics service providers to foster a more competitive and diverse ecosystem, reducing potential biases.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
In my experience, the key to balancing centralization and efficiency is by implementing a well-structured governance framework. By creating multi-signature decision-making processes and transparent voting systems, we can maintain decentralization while still achieving our objectives efficiently.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Split Reimbursement
In my extensive experience with DeFi projects and hacks, I’ve observed that a split reimbursement approach offers a fair solution. This approach holds project teams accountable for their security measures while still providing relief to affected users. Full reimbursement should be reserved for situations where the exploit is entirely beyond the project team’s control.

Sample Voting Issue 1:

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

DeFi development on Arbitrum, Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization


All this talk like in other projects… like politics in real life… pretending to care about communities while they want to make a legacy, there will be no point if people who have a lot of money will manage the project as a whole in their own interests. Our task is for ordinary people who worked for the airdrop and want to see a bright future for the project that will not be ashamed of!


The overall goal of a DAO is to create a decentralized and autonomous community that can make decisions and take actions without the need for centralized authority or intermediaries.
I will propose a revolutionary approach to this business that will help build a community for years to come! This is the help of Artificial Intelligence in all matters, recommendations, suggestions regarding the work of the community. It has no emotions, no preferences, no desire to get rich - only ideas based on all experiences in the cryptocommunity and in the world at large. I want to do something in my lifetime that people will remember from a good point of view. I think we will realize it all together! And build the biggest and strongest community structure in the cryptocurrency world.
6. First example about Uniswap.
I will answer right away - I am against centralization and the fact that all power is going to be in the same hands! This is contrary to the technologies that we create and what we want to get away from Web 2! I also asked the AI how she sees the situation, she can not have preferences, but she explains any situation and speaks as for me objectively. For example, what AI said on this topic: ""As an AI assistant, I don’t have personal opinions or the ability to vote. However, I can provide some insights on how to approach these questions.
Regarding the proposal, it’s important to consider the potential implications of centralizing power and authority in the hands of a few. While the proposal may have some benefits, such as attracting new users to Uniswap, it’s crucial to ensure that all stakeholders have a say in decision-making processes and that power is not concentrated in the hands of a few.
If I were to make amendments to the proposal, I would consider involving other analytics service providers in the allocation and oversight committees to ensure a more diverse and inclusive decision-making process. Additionally, I would propose a more transparent and open process for allocating resources and overseeing the program to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
When it comes to the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, it’s important to strike a balance. While centralization can help streamline decision-making processes and achieve goals more efficiently, it can also lead to unfair allocation of resources and potential conflicts of interest. It’s crucial to involve all stakeholders in decision-making processes and ensure transparency and accountability in all actions taken. By doing so, we can create a more decentralized and inclusive web3 ecosystem that benefits everyone involved.
Overall, this situation highlights the importance of transparency and decentralization in the web3 space. It’s crucial to ensure that all stakeholders have a say in decision-making processes and that power is not concentrated in the hands of a few.""

By doing so, we can create a more decentralized and inclusive web3 ecosystem that benefits everyone involved.


I am very kind and therefore would return everything to people, but AI suggested how to act correctly in this situation and what he would do and I agree with him, he is right and his arguments are close to me:
«If I had been a voter, I would have leaned towards a separate refund. This means that the damage would be distributed among the victims in accordance with their share of investments in Rari. Thus, people who invested more would get more reimbursement than those who invested less. However, this is just my opinion and the decision should be made by the Rari community after discussing all possible options.
Additional discussions and compromises can be held to find a solution that is acceptable to all involved. Additional research and analysis can also be carried out to more accurately determine the causes of a breach and develop better security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. It is important to emphasize that any decision must be made taking into account the interests of all participants and in accordance with the rules and principles established for a given situation.»


Languages: English, Ukrainian, Russian


I will disclose any conflicts of interest and follow the rules and regulations of the Arbitrum community.


To start it is important to ensure that all featured delegates are acting in the best interest of advancing the Arbitrum ecosystem and not letting any conflicts of interest influence their decisions. This helps to ensure a fair and transparent governance process that benefits the entire ecosystem.
In order to maintain integrity and transparency, it is important for all parties involved to disclose any potential conflicts of interest they may have. This helps to prevent any biases or conflicts from influencing decision-making and ensures that all parties involved are acting in the best interest of the ecosystem.",513

Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:

About Liquidity Mining

i don’t care about liquidity mining, because i prefer to use crypto to play moreover i love the upcoming metaverse world.

About Dao

In my opinion dao is the key and the main goal of what crypto has done and needed so far where the decentralized system is what the community needs the most, especially since real world governments can no longer be trusted. Apart from all that, in my opinion, the existing dao system is not perfect, such as the number of spam proposals that can harm the community, take away the community’s treasury, and even attempt to hijack the dao itself. so this is where we as decentralization supporters need to develop a dao system that is safe from all things that can undermine the trust of the wider community out there.

Against

because I don’t like unfair reward systems that can only increase the amount of token supply which can worsen the tokenomic conditions of a project and only care about new users who don’t necessarily use the project in the long term, let alone disturb stakeholders which can result in an unfair number of voters proposal on dao and this is not according to the principle that I expected.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
reject and propose to book the proposal until there is agreement in the community and there is a solution to make the token deployment good for the community not to be fixed on one party.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
in my opinion there should be collaboration between decentralization and centralization because these two things if used properly can create something impressive like in governance related to common interests yes we need dao but in terms of technical issues that only need specialists we may only be able to rely on the system centralization in the selection although actually the dao also can.

provide separate costs such as 30% reimbursement if it is the case with a third party where they have made a good contribution to the community, and provide reimbursement of up to 60% if it is a major community case.
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.

Good

using a half-return system by determining cases for problems related to the dao community directly or third parties who have good contributions to the community while protecting the economy from expenses and funds can also be used for the process of strengthening the network and not disrupting the economy because treasury reserves are very important for the community to make decisions.

Not Good

if the community reimbursed 100% of the costs, it would lead to unhealthy treasury conditions, so that other additional funds needed to be sought so as not to disrupt the existing economic system.

Stance on overall goals for the DAO: The DAO should strike a balance between attracting users through liquidity mining programs and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. Additionally, the DAO should prioritize decentralization, transparency, and community involvement in decision-making processes.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Vote: Against
Amendments: Redistribute the seats on the allocation and oversight committees to ensure a more balanced representation of the community and include other analytics service providers.
Approach to tradeoff: Prioritize decentralization to prevent the concentration of power while also promoting effective collaboration and communication within the community to ensure efficient decision-making.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Choice: Split Reimbursement
Reasoning: Reimbursement should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the project’s response to the exploit, the impact on users, and the overall health of the ecosystem. Split reimbursement acknowledges the shared responsibility between the project and the users and encourages better security practices in the future.

DAOs use liquidity mining strategy to incentivize liquidity providers and reward their members for their contributions to the platform. They can choose a more aggressive or less risky approach depending on their goals and risk tolerance. Transparency, security, and effective management are common issues that DAOs can solve by implementing transparent decision-making processes, reliable security protocols, and community-driven governance structures. In general, DAO’s goals and liquidity mining approach should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and contributions from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of a broader ecosystem. The compromise between centralization of power and the ability to execute tasks is a common challenge for any organization, including DAOs. On one hand, centralized authority can provide clear leadership and decision making, leading to faster execution and more efficient resource utilization. On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of a wider community.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
I would vote Against this proposal. I would propose to allocate a certain budget for this initiative, which would allow Flipside crypto to get things done, but no ability to spend/release more than a certain number of UNI tokens. If the initiative in the end will need more than the budget, another proposal can be added to allocate more UNI tokens for this initiative.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
This would highly depend on specific language the proposals used. If they used the same exact language, the second vote should not have been allowed. Double jeopardy should not be allowed. (idea introduced in US constitution.) If, however, there was some issue with the original plan, it might be reasonable to have a second vote, and obey the second decision.
Exact same language in both - Full Reimburesement.
If first decision had an implementation issue (for example was technically impossible) - obey the second decision - No Reimbursement.

Compartilhe sua posição sobre os objetivos gerais do DAO:
A mineração de liquidez é uma estratégia em que os provedores de liquidez adicionam seus fundos em um pool de liquidez, permitindo que os usuários negociem criptomoedas com base em um modelo de mercado automatizado. No entanto, a agressividade da mineração de liquidez pode variar dependendo da situação e dos objetivos dos provedores de liquidez.
Em geral, a agressividade da mineração de liquidez deve ser equilibrada com o risco associado a essa estratégia. Os provedores de liquidez podem aumentar a agressividade da mineração de liquidez para maximizar seus retornos, mas isso pode aumentar o risco de perda de capital devido à volatilidade do mercado ou a outros fatores.
O objetivo de um DAO (Organização Autônoma Descentralizada) é fornecer uma estrutura organizacional autônoma e descentralizada que permita que os membros da comunidade tomem decisões de forma democrática e transparente. Os DAOs são baseados em contratos inteligentes que são executados em uma blockchain e permitem que os membros da comunidade votem em questões importantes, como a alocação de recursos ou a implementação de novas iniciativas.
Os objetivos específicos de um DAO podem variar dependendo da comunidade e do projeto. Alguns DAOs podem ter como objetivo fornecer serviços financeiros descentralizados, enquanto outros podem se concentrar em projetos de desenvolvimento de software ou em iniciativas de impacto social. No geral, o objetivo de um DAO é capacitar a comunidade a tomar decisões coletivas e participar ativamente do projeto, de forma justa e transparente.

Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
No
Decentralization is the charm of the blockchain, we cannot compromise because of short-term interests!
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

We should try to avoid situations where voting rights are controlled by a few organizations!

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Power can be concentrated, but it must be restrained!
The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a classic dilemma in organizational management. Centralization can lead to faster decision-making, more efficient resource allocation, and a stronger sense of direction and unity, but it can also stifle innovation, creativity, and flexibility. On the other hand, decentralization can foster experimentation, diversity, and adaptability, but it can also result in slower decision-making, duplication of effort, and weaker coordination.
The key is to strike a balance between centralization and decentralization that fits the specific context and goals of the organization. Factors that may influence this balance include the size and complexity of the organization, the level of expertise and trust of its members, the nature of its tasks and challenges, the degree of external pressure and competition, and the values and culture of its stakeholders.
In practice, organizations may adopt different degrees and forms of centralization and decentralization depending on the situation. For example, they may delegate decision-making authority to lower levels while retaining strategic control at the top, or they may empower teams or individuals to make decisions within certain boundaries while providing guidance and support from above.
Ultimately, the key to a successful balance between centralization and decentralization is to maintain effective communication, feedback, and learning mechanisms that allow the organization to adapt and evolve over time.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
We need to choose according to the specific situation. If the loss is within the range that the project party can bear and it is not the user’s fault, I think it should be Full Reimbursement in this case. If the project party is beyond its capabilities, I think it can be paid in installments!

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The ultimate goal of the DAO should remain as:

Full decentralization while minimizing the risk of manipulation.
Completely autonomous functionality without the need for human intervention.

Liquidity mining should be competitive, but the need for exceptional aggression in this area is likely absent. Arbitrum already possesses a commanding market share (54% according to TechCrunch) in the L2 Ethereum competitive landscape, so liquidity mining programs will already operate at an advantage. In other words, liquidity mining will already benefit from Arbitrum’s prolific ecosystem, so uncommonly high rewards and incentives are not necessary to attract liquidity.
Sample Voting Issue 1:


How would you vote?
Against


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Amendment 1 - No entity shall maintain more than 2 seats on the allocation committee for a period of more than 7 days. In the case of an emergency vacation from a committee seat by an existing member, the seat may be tentatively filled by another member until a suitable replacement is agreed upon.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Centralization of authority stands in direct conflict with the mission of decentralized governance, therefore the question must be confined to guaranteeing the punctual participation and efficient execution of a decentralized consensus.


Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
If the reimbursement were delegated to a community vote, as was the case when ‘Full Hack Payment’ was passed with 95.65% approval, it must be honored.
Voting aside, I would handle the situation as follows:

Split Reimbursement
There is an acknowledged assumption of risk by parties participating in any DeFi investment. However, there is also a reasonable expectation of security provided by projects when engaging in decentralized finance.

The best approach to restore as much trust as possible in the protocol while taking into consideration its longevity is a split reimbursement to affected parties for the maximum amount that does not put the protocol at risk of failure. The publicity of any bad act will already damage the project’s reputation and patronage, so it is paramount to make a tangible effort to restore the faith of the community without doing so at the risk of bankruptcy.

New chains are ultimately new frontiers that have been opened up. All of the space and technological resources are worth very little without settlers. The primary goals of the DAO should be to secure the protocol and increase the number of users active users by fostering community and supporting developers building upon Arbitrum. Users, assets, and productive activity drive value to a chain, and enticing those users and assets to Arbitrum are the priority for DAO resources.

While GFX Labs hadn’t been founded at the time, the founder, Getty Hill, tried to vote against the proposal due to the unusual funding structure, the size of the program, and its overall nature. Unfortunately, Tally’s governance interface had a bug that caused Against votes to be cast as For votes. This caused the proposal to cross the necessary quorum threshold. Fortunately, the original proposer had dropped below the required number of votes, and Getty was able to cancel the proposal.
More to the point, through GFX’s extensive experience in protocol governance, we try to bring a realistic approach to protocol governance and protocol improvements. We’re in the very early days of DeFi and protocol governance, so it isn’t practical to “decentralize” everything. That said, we need to see progress towards healthy decentralization of protocols and applications.

Protocol hacks are always extremely unfortunate events. The circumstances behind the hack make it particularly difficult to decide on an outcome. Without getting into the weeds of the issue, we think it’s important that a protocol acknowledge its shortcomings (where there are any) and take steps to best position itself for long-term success. We’ve seen a few instances of protocols having a bug that leads to a loss of users’ funds and users using a protocol in unexpected ways leading to a loss of funds. We approach each instance with caution and due diligence the nature of the bug, the users affected by the bug, the protocol’s total risk, and avenues to best position the protocol moving forward.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Against
No amendments, just cancel it altogether.
The solution is [reputational avatars], which solves most if not all DAO participation and token-weight voting problems.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.
It would depend on the specific circumstances of the hack and the impact on the affected parties. In general, it is important to balance the needs of the affected parties with the overall health and sustainability of the project. Full reimbursement may not always be feasible or sustainable, but partial reimbursement or other forms of compensation may be appropriate in certain cases. Ultimately, any decision should be made with transparency and community input to ensure fairness and accountability

I have a strong interest in Public Foods Funding, DeFi development and data collection tools. In terms of liquidity incentives, I think the incentives should be used to introduce new platforms for newcomers as well as to set limits for larger capitals. I believe that ArbitumDao should use incentives to raise awareness of Arbitum-based dApps, and as a result capital will naturally move in.
As for the sample issue, I vote against it. Instead, I propose to improve the proposal by adding firm milestones to the process and transferring the initial amount to Flipside after each milestone is reached and then subsequent parts. So we can find a balance between centralizing power and being able to do things.

Public Goods funding


Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO:
I believe that the goal of the DAO should be to focus on encouraging/incentivizing a healthy community growth & participation, and the development & growth of a vibrant ecosystem.
Overall I believe the DAO should prioritize decentralization and inclusiveness for all, where the DAO will assume multiple roles in governing and enabling growth of Arbitrum. Such as, but not limited to:

Technical, protocol and security changes/upgrades;
Token incentives and liquidity mining;
Hackathons;
Grants;


Sample Voting Issue 1:


Against, as there is a conflict of interest and the 50% operation fee is far too high.


I would propose reducing Flipside’s 50% operation fee and reduce their representation in the allocation and oversight committees to make the allocation process more fair and transparent. Also other analytics providers should have been considered that were unaccounted in the proposal.


In regards to “getting things done” in some circumstances centralization of authority may be necessary for efficient decision-making, especially as speed/efficiency and decentralisation are inversely proportional to each other, however it should not be at the expense of the interests of the wider community and decentralization should always remain the focus.
Ultimately as long as centralized actions are dependent on the approval of the DAO and that they operate transparently, it’s something necessary for “getting things done”, especially in the early development of DAOs.



Sample Voting Issue 2:
Split Reimbursement
In my opinion reimbursement should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis dependent on the underlining factors of the exploit (such as team knowledge, prevention, exploit severity, audited and etc.), the impact that it had on users and strength of ecosystem/treasury at the time to be able to support a full or partial reimbursement.
I believe a partial reimbursement is something that should be generally always considered when users have trusted to use your project. Users entrust that projects have taken the appropriate steps to ensure security of their project. A partial reimbursement at minimum is a fair solution when a full reimbursement is not possible, it holds project teams accountable for their security measures while still providing some level of compensation to affected users.
While a full reimbursement would fully compensate affected users and be ideal for the users, it could lead to a negative long term effect on the project or ultimately the death of the project depending on the state of the treasury and size of the exploit at the time.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
This proposal was initially overlooked but gained attention at the last minute. The proposal received support from large university clubs, as they would have a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner voiced concerns about the centralization of power and favoritism towards one service provider.
Prompts to Answer:
How would you vote?
Against.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would suggest reducing the control and influence of the selected service provider and allowing more participation from other analytics service providers.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I believe it is important to strike a balance between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done. It is crucial to ensure that the decision-making process is fair and transparent while allowing for efficient execution.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The foremost objective of a DAO is to enable the healthy and decentralized growth of the rollup. This vision can encompass various aspects, including technical and security-focused sections of the rollup that the DAO should supervise, as well as promoting the development of a vibrant ecosystem and ARB token growth. Ultimately, every decision taken by the DAO should reflect the question: “How does this promote the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?”
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?
For

In order for a DAO to operate efficiently in the long run, it is essential to delegate voting power. Although this can result in a certain level of centralization, it is still a positive step as long as the delegates do not have an excessive amount of control over the larger DAO and there are sufficient measures in place to ensure their accountability.
Balancing centralization of authority with the need to get things done can be a challenge for a DAO. While effective decision-making may require some degree of centralization, it is crucial that any centralized entities are ultimately accountable to the DAO and operate with transparency. DAOs should consider centralizing decision-making only when specialist knowledge or expertise is required, and ensure that any centralized entities are trusted members of the community.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Split Reimbursement
Loss of funds due to hacks is a major obstacle to gaining trust in the space and attracting new users. When large amounts of funds are drained from protocol contracts, people become less willing to take risks and connect with other protocols, jeopardizing the concept of Financial Legos. To address this issue, protocols should consider offering partial reimbursement to parties that entrust their security. This gratitude recognizes the dedication and trust placed in the protocol. DAO insurance protocols are also being developed to address this concern in the future. However, full reimbursement may not always be advisable, especially if the hack severely impacts the protocol. While compensation should be offered, a full reimbursement could have the same impact as a second devastating hack and lead the DAO into a negative death spiral.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Regarding liquidity mining, DAOs may choose to be more or less aggressive depending on their particular objectives and risk tolerance. Liquidity mining can be a way to incentivize participation and provide liquidity for a particular token or platform, but it also carries risks such as impermanent loss and volatility. DAOs may consider factors such as the long-term sustainability of the liquidity mining program, the potential impact on the token price and market cap, and the potential benefits for the overall ecosystem.
The goal of a DAO can vary depending on its specific focus or objectives. Some DAOs may be primarily focused on creating and managing decentralized applications or services, while others may be focused on providing a platform for collective investment and fundraising. Ultimately, the goal of a DAO should align with its members’ interests and be designed to create value for its stakeholders.
It’s important for DAOs to consider the potential risks and benefits of their decisions, as well as the potential impact on their stakeholders and the broader ecosystem. DAOs may also consider feedback and input from the communities they serve and engage in open communication and transparency to ensure that their decisions are aligned with their goals and values.

Tools for improving protocol decentralization
Please share your position on the common goals of the DAO:
My overall goal as a potential Arbitrum DAO blockchain delegate is to promote community growth and development while ensuring the representation of all stakeholders’ interests. I believe that to achieve this, DAO should prioritize initiatives that increase liquidity and encourage participation from various stakeholders.
Although liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for stimulating participation and momentum growth, I believe it should be approached with caution and a long-term perspective. In my opinion, DAO’s primary goal should be to create a sustainable and flexible ecosystem capable of withstanding market fluctuations and adapting to changing conditions.
Regarding issues raised in other communities, I believe it is important to use an active and collaborative approach to problem-solving and building trust. By interacting with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can develop a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits all participants.
Ultimately, my position on these issues is based on a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible management of resources and assets entrusted to DAO. As a delegate, I will tirelessly work to ensure that community interests are represented, and the DAO continues to thrive and grow in the long term.
Example Voting Question 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against Uniswap’s proposal in its current form. While I believe that rewards can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the distribution of UNI and program oversight. In my opinion, this could lead to a concentration of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Example Voting Question 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the situation with reimbursing expenses related to the Rari exploit is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a delicate approach. While I sympathize with those affected by the exploit, I believe it is important to carefully weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement.
In my opinion, the decision to compensate parties affected by the exploit should be based on several factors, including the severity of the exploit, its impact on the community, and the ability to reimburse. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly dangerous or if it was the result of a systemic issue on the platform. However, in other cases, it may be impossible or impractical…
I believe that the decision to compensate affected parties for damages related to an exploit must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific circumstances.  As a delegate, I will work for the benefit of all members of the community so that their interests are represented fairly and decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.",543

Topic: Organizing a System of Motivation for DAO Arbitrum Contributors 
 NFTs Interactions (Buy/Sell)
Purpose: Fundraising for the DAO Arbitrum.
Activity: NFT mint.
Implementations:

Create an NFT collection for each protocol.
Provide mint capability on Galxe .
Assign rewards for each group of collectors > for owners of all NFTs > for owners of 2 NFTs > for owners of 1 NFT
Determine the number of possible NFT holders for each protocol.
5.Example:* there are 3k testers in DiamondProtocol, about 80% of them will make a mint (statistics should be clarified using the example of early NFT mint)
The collected finances for NFT mint should cover the costs of creating the collection, organization, maintenance, remuneration (30% of the total amount) and 70% should go to the DAO treasury.
Rewards distribution needs to be improved - it is important that everyone can be guaranteed at least something, for example, starting from owning 2x NFTs.
It will also allow you to create an NFT market, where you can set a certain percentage of copyrights, which will also allow you to replenish the treasury of the DAO. .

Theory:

The average number of participants for each protocol is 8k
Presumably in a minute they will accept 60% - 4.8k
For convenience, we accept 10 rounds - collection from 10 NFTs.
The cost of 1 NFT is 1 USDС 5. Total 48,000.00 USD, of which 14,400.00 for collateral and rewards, 33,600.00 to the DAO treasury.

 NFTs Lending.
Another way to replenish the treasury of the DAO.

There must be a limited number for each NFT.
There must be a real and very profitable utility for every NFT.
There should be the largest possible deficit.

All these and other conditions should be directed only to the maximum possible and favorable conditions for NFT holders.
Owning an NFT would be really profitable in a financial sense.
With this approach and a full deficit, it is possible to create an active NFT market not only for sale, but also for rent. And most importantly, from each transaction on interaction with the NFT, it is necessary to provide for deductions to the treasury of the DAO.
For example: the owner of the NFT is not in the active phase of interaction with the project. He can rent out his NFT for a certain period and earn on it. In turn, 10-30% of the cost of renting NFT is deducted to the treasury of the DAO at the expense of the one who rents it. This will allow to steadily replenish the treasury of the DAO and create an NFT rental market. The most important thing is that the NFT utility is really meaningful in terms of money, and there is also a shortage of NFT.
 Sub Rent NFT
There are cases when a user is ready to lease his NFT, for example for 1 year. In this case, provide for the possibility of releasing the leased NFT. This further activates the NFT market and, as a result, replenishes the treasury of the DAO.
> In all of the above, the most important issue remains a really financially profitable utility for the NFT. this issue remains open and requires active participation in the discussion. The benefit should be such that everyone wants to have NFT at least for a while, as much as possible!
But at the same time, We can face the real facts that there’re type of contributors who will want to immediately sell their NFTs.
Each type of our contributors are important, it is important for everyone that the value of the NFT be attractive.
And it seems to me that those who want to immediately “flip/sell” NFT should be more interested in offering valuable features.
The purpose of this proposal is to find out the level of interest of the community and the team in deep development of the distribution scheme of the future Arbitrum’s NFT.
Why

Each significant event, starting from the date of the DAO Arbitrum foundation, can be provided by the NFT.
If the member participated in the event, they may be eligible for NFT claims.
By collecting an NFTs from the collection, contributor can claim benefits that will be determined in the future. The quantity need not be equal to 1 NFT of a particular type.
For example, distribute 1 NFT to all participants of the Crew3, but at the same time, to form a full-fledged collection, you need to have 3 such NFTs in your wallet.
You can also consider burning the entire collection and receiving in return one NFT with a full list of privileges (the list of privileges is additionally determined).
This decision will create an active NFT market, as a result of which it is possible to replenish the treasury of the DAO Arbitrum through deductions from sales.
This will attract additional participation of active users from the NFT sphere, which in turn will spread information about the DAO Arbitrum.

Primary goals for the DAO:
As a blockchain developer, my primary aim within the DAO is to create a diverse range of tools and applications that make the Arbitrum ecosystem enjoyable and accessible for everyone. For instance, I recently developed a personal assistant Telegram bot that utilizes tokens to function and generate responses. My expertise in creating decentralized applications (DApps) allows me to contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. By prioritizing the long-term sustainability of the ARB token and the broader future of rollups, I am committed to fostering an inclusive and engaging environment for all users.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty:
Vote: In Favor
Proposed amendments:

Allocate grants on a quarterly basis instead of annually for enhanced oversight and management.
Establish regular votes and checkpoints to ensure ongoing DAO approval and grantee accountability.

Approach to balancing centralization of authority and efficiency: Centralization should be considered when specialist knowledge and swift action are required. As long as these centralized entities remain accountable to the DAO and operate transparently, centralization can be a vital instrument for DAO development.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reimbursement:
Choice: Partial Reimbursement
Reasoning: Considering partial reimbursement recognizes the trust and commitment of users who have engaged with the protocol. However, offering full reimbursement may harm the protocol, particularly when the impact of the hack is significant.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The goal of the DAO is decentralization. The benefits of leaning into decentralizing include:

Increased Security. the blockchain would be controlled by a community of stakeholders rather than a single entity, thereby making a DAO less vulnerable to capture.
Greater Transparency. DAOs operate in a transparent manner allowing anybody to see how decisions are made and how funds are allocated. This fosters trust and accountability, which will mean a lot as the blockchain evolves and scales.
Increased Efficiency. With proper planning and procedures a DAO can increase efficiency in decision making and execution.
Community Governance. A DAO, an empowers a community of  to participate in decision-making and governance. This can lead to greater buy-in and commitment and can help ensure that decisions are made with the best interests of the community in mind.

With this in mind, the DAO should support the community of Arbitrum users as well as support improvements to the blockchain itself. Nobody is more in touch with how the chain is performing than the people who use it most. It therefore make a lot of sense for the community to be involved in the decisions that affect them.

Sample Issue 1
The first Sample Issue I would like to Bring up is a new one, that has not gone up for vote yet but I think it is an interesting proposal. Many of us have heard of the End Game Proposal at Maker DAO. This was a proposal that essentially divided Maker DAO into two camps, originalist and Meta DAOists.  Essentially the End Game breaks the DAO up into smaller components.
The latest proposal put forward by user GFXLabs feels the proposal creates too much internal bureaucracy where they should be focused on expanded the use of DAI on other chains. You can read the proposal here
You can read all about endgame here
Without getting into any of the tokenomics issues that were brought up in these proposals, I would like to cover the idea of sub DAOs. While it appears to be more bureaucratic, I’m not sure that they are. In fact smaller groups of people, when given the correct tools to work with can be very efficient in their decision making, as the people that are closet to a problem being solved, are the ones most likely to have the correct answers.
DAOs can get stuck and not progress quickly when small, responsible groups are not empowered to move things forward. Throughout the tech industry, it is important to be agile. For this reason, I would come out in the side of the Endgame proposal.
Sample Voting Issue #2
This one come from real experience but I don’t feel sharing links and details are needed to get the point across.
This one had to do with a membership proposal. In this case I probably voted incorrectly and I have learned from that. It was in a permissioned entry DAO (member must be voted in). The DAO had been chewing through it’s runway and the membership proposal would have been a nice boost for the treasury and hence a positive effect on the community we help support. This is how I was seeing it and voted Yes.
The problem with this was some of the normal procedures for applying to the DAO were not followed. The proposal did not pass and I ended up being on the wrong side on that one. The correct way for me to have voted would have been to ensure all of the normal operating procedures were being followed.
It may seem a little weird to talk about my mistakes in a delegate application but I wanted to share it because it was a learning experience for me, of which I’ve had many in the DAO space. I am willing to learn from mistake and continue to advocate for DAOs.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The goals of a DAO may vary depending on its purpose, structure, and governance model. However, some common goals may include:
Governance: The DAO may aim to provide a decentralized governance system where members can participate in decision-making processes to drive the direction of the DAO.
Funding: The DAO may aim to provide funding opportunities for projects or ventures that align with its vision and values.
Innovation: The DAO may aim to foster innovation by providing a platform for experimentation and collaboration among members.
Liquidity: The DAO may aim to provide liquidity to its members or the wider community through various mechanisms such as liquidity mining.
Regarding how aggressive the DAO should be in liquidity mining, it depends on the DAO’s risk appetite, financial resources, and long-term goals. While liquidity mining can be an effective tool to incentivize participation and attract liquidity, it can also be risky and volatile. Therefore, it’s essential to consider the potential benefits and risks before deciding on the optimal level of liquidity mining.
Ultimately, the DAO’s goal should align with its mission and values, and decisions should be made based on sound governance principles, transparency, and community participation.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?


The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex issue that requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. On the one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear lines of decision-making and swift action, which can lead to efficient outcomes. On the other hand, a highly centralized system can also lead to a lack of diversity of perspectives and an inability to adapt to changing circumstances.

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

Cuz I believe full reimbursement is not good for a DAO(I don’t think they can pay/should pay) and also no reimbursement is not great for their member so Split Reimbursement is the best option for being Hacked, Drained.

Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
My aim as a potential delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain is to foster the growth and development of the community while advocating for the interests of all members. To accomplish this, I recommend that the DAO prioritize initiatives that enhance liquidity and encourage involvement from diverse stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be an effective method for incentivizing participation and generating momentum, I believe that it should be approached with caution and a focus on long-term sustainability and resilience. In my opinion, the primary objective of the DAO should be to establish a stable ecosystem capable of withstanding market fluctuations and adapting to changing circumstances.
With respect to concerns that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it is crucial to proactively address these issues through collaborative and respectful engagement with members of other communities. This approach can help to establish a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these matters is grounded in a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible management of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work diligently to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow in the long run
Sample Voting Issue 1
If I were a delegate, I would oppose the current version of the Uniswap proposal. Although I acknowledge that bounties can be a valuable method for drawing in new Uniswap users, I believe that the proposal grants Flipside Crypto excessive influence over the distribution of UNI and supervision of the initiative. This could result in the concentration of power and an inequitable advantage for Flipside, from my perspective
Sample Voting Issue 2
As a delegate, I consider the reimbursement dilemma stemming from the Rari hack to be a complicated issue that demands a thoughtful examination and a nuanced strategy. Although I empathize with those impacted by the hack, I think that it’s critical to assess the potential advantages and disadvantages of any reimbursement scheme with caution.
From my perspective, whether or not to compensate those impacted by an exploit should be determined based on various considerations, such as the severity of the exploit, its impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In certain instances, full reimbursement may be appropriate, particularly if the exploit was particularly damaging or arose from a systemic problem within the platform. Nevertheless, in other cases, providing full reimbursement may not be feasible or suitable. As a result, I believe that the decision on whether or not to reimburse those affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique aspects of each incident. As a delegate, I would strive to guarantee that the interests of all members of the community are represented impartially and that choices are made transparently and prudently.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:
Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.
These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reinbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors. 9 A full reinbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

Loving Governance participation
Supporting Governance as much as possible.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.

The foremost advantage of a governance token is evident in the facility of decentralization. Developers can introduce decentralization in [web3] projects, primarily due to governance token integration. Without a specific governance token, you are more likely to find [DeFi solutions as a bunch of [smart contracts] stuffed into one platform. In other words, the advantage of governance tokens in crypto focuses on the way they show tangible proof of true decentralization.*
With the advantage of voting with the governance token, you can figure out how they can open up collaboration opportunities. Voting allows an open stage for discussions, subsequently leading to productive collaborations. Governance token holders can express their vote on issues for the network while receiving incentives for collaborations with other community members.*
The next promising benefit of entries in a governance tokens list would obviously point to efficiency. Collaboration among community members through a governance token creates a sense of involvement among community members. Active collaborations among community members in the decision-making process and determining new definitions of governance models help in improving efficiency.*

Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

NFT development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation

How aggressive should we be in liquidity mining?
Arbitrum has experienced steady and consistent growth, already accruing a large TVL. Therefore, a measured approach being careful not to front-load incentives too heavily initially, would provide more ammo for future adjustments while not allowing airdrop farmers to extract all the value from the Arbitrum ecosystem.
What is the goal of the DAO?
Empowering the community through crypto-economic incentives for alignment in developing and creating a more accessible blockchain should be the DAO’s goal. Discourse should be open, transparent, and inclusive. Furthermore, decentralization is paramount and should be prioritized only second to the chain’s security.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
1. Against.
2. My amendment would limit Flipside to having only two seats, ensuring the community has the majority say. In addition, the council would not include any blockchain clubs. Such clubs tend to vote in unison based on ideological principles without bearing the consequences of their decisions.
I acknowledge that blockchain clubs can bring valuable knowledge and perspectives to decision-making processes related to blockchain technology. My previous statement should not be interpreted as advocating for their exclusion from the process. Rather, I believe it’s important to maintain checks and balances on their influence to ensure fair representation and decision-making within the community.
3. For effective decision-making, it is important to ensure that those in positions of power are held accountable through appropriate checks and balances. One way to achieve this is by diversifying the centralized authorities in charge, which can help to establish and reinforce those checks and balances within the decision-making process. By distributing power more widely, decision-making can become more transparent, inclusive, and reflective of the interests and perspectives of the broader community.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - FEI RARI Hack
1. Full reimbursement.
It is advisable for protocols to establish insurance funds to mitigate the impact of bugs in their code. Although it may not be feasible to provide a full reimbursement of 100 cents on the dollar in every case, protocols should strive to compensate those affected to the best of their ability within the framework of their proposed insurance fund structure. This approach can help to safeguard users and ensure the stability and reliability of the protocol in the long term.

The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a common challenge for any organization, including DAOs. On one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear leadership and decision-making, leading to faster execution and more efficient use of resources. On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision-making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of the wider community.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
1 The proposal to give excessive power to Flipside on allocation and oversight committees could lead to concentration of power and partiality towards a specific service provider, potentially harming Uniswap’s success. Lack of consultation with other analytics service providers may limit potential benefits for the community. While the proposal has some support from university clubs, the priority should be the best interest of the wider Uniswap community, and therefore, I would vote against the proposal to ensure long-term viability and success.
2 My proposed amendments would include reducing Flipside’s representation on committees, involving representatives from other service providers, ensuring transparency and accountability in the decision-making process, and including a consultation process with the community.
3 Centralization can streamline decision-making and processes for efficient results, but it can also concentrate power and lead to favoritism. Decentralization can promote equal distribution of power, but may result in slower decision-making and complex processes. Uniswap’s proposal to use Flipside for bounties should consider both the benefits and risks of centralization. Clear guidelines and checks can ensure transparency and fairness. Input from stakeholders and analysis of costs and benefits should guide the decision to strike a balance between efficiency, fairness, and transparency.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Consider the exploit’s nature and circumstances to determine reimbursement. Negligence or malpractice by the party means partial reimbursement, while an uncontrollable exploit may warrant full reimbursement. Rari hack’s cause is uncertain, but splitting reimbursement may be a fair compromise. Decide on a case-by-case basis, balancing accountability with assisting those affected by uncontrollable exploits.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The DAO should aggressively pursue decentralisation & aim to have different delegates from projects spanning its eco-system. The goal should be to report a consensus that describes the combination of best interests & desires from the wider community.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Answer
1:
For. While Flipsides influence on the board is considerable, we still must think how we can act in Uni’s best interest. The program & outline were fine, and I don’t see that their influence in the comittee’s is likely to result in issues and as a result feel it is wasted to reject the proposal on this basis.




Suggestions could be made with regards to Flipsides influence on the board. We may want to consider proposing a greater Uni influence, albeit this may slow things down.




There needs to be equilibrium. The goals of the DAO should be to allow the project to thrive in a decentralised way as much as is reasonably practicable. We need to approach each issue as it comes through a decentralised network of delegates & other interested parties.

Answer:
My initial thoughts are Full Reimbursement given this is economically feasible for the future of Rari. The situation is unfortunate & we must be sensitive to the affect this will have on our customers lives & on our social image. We must also consider the affects the reimbursement would have on the business. If the business could not survive offering full reimbursement, then we should explore other options.

Who am I ?
Crypto enthusiast since 2017. I started as a Public Delegate in EulerDAO and then was promoted to the Active Delegate in the DAO. I helped, among other things, to fine tune the governance processes, including Governance optimisation, anti-gaming voting mechanisms, Recognised Delegates programme etc.
My values:


Adherence to the founding principles of a project: in this case enshrined in the Article 5 of the Arbitrum Constitution.

Impartiality: Before making the final decisionI I take into account all opinions of the DAO members.

Transparency: My rationale behind any decision is public.

Scrutiny: Any proposal should be properly discussed and examined.

Security: Security of the ecosystem and DAO shall prevail over momentary market opportunities.

What area are you most interested in contributing to?

Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost the DAO needs to fine-tune its governance process, that includes but not limited to:

Sustainable participation of representatives of various groups of the community, i.e. developers, the team, investors and foremost ordinary users. Incentivized programmes and delegate hierarchy are strongly recommended.
Decisions should be taken by the community as a whole and not just big token holders, primarily investors or the team.
Transparent and systematized governance process, including timing, proposal templates, step-by-step proposal life cycle. Anti-gaming and bots-preventing mechanisms should be developed.
A comprehensive and efficient grant management.
Due diversification of the treasury should be envisaged.

As for the question how aggressive we should be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO? I would prefer steady growth vs aggressive marketing through liquidity mining to raise TVL. My experience shows that it is wise to keep incentive tools for the future promotion of new products. I would suggest at least 5+ years liquidity mining with steady increases over time till the middle and gradual decrease after.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1. Uniswap x Flipside:

How would you vote?

Against, unless amendments described below are made.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

I would suggest the following amendments:

Set a trial period of 6 months with reduced budget to at least $ 3 mil. (Despite Flipside previously implemented a pilot, the budget was only $ 25 k that cannot provide the DAO with reliable proves that Flipside will be able to manage bigger amounts of money)
Decrease the number of seats to be occupied by the Flipside team in the Allocation Committee to 1.
Increase the overall number of seats in the Oversight committee to 4, so that the Flipside member does not have the final say.
Guarantee that Uniswap labs team has one seat in each Committee.
The rest of the seats shall be democratically elected by the DAO and not be nominated upfront without elections.
The economy of the programme is largely based on projected yield earned. However, with the extreme turbulence on crypto markets the DAO cannot rely exclusively on yield projections. In this regard, there economy should be split into two scenarios: 1) basic/neutral, that will guarantee implementation of the programme disrespectful to the yield earned or not earned and 2) bonus, that will include projected yields


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

That is the major dilemma of any DAO. First we need to split this into ordinary and emergency issues. The First should rely on decentralized decision making, while the second requires immediate actions for the benefit of the DAO, consequently centralisation of authority is justified in this case. This dilemma is well addressed in the Arbitrum Constitution.
Another aspect is participation. With time the passion of the majority of the DAO will inevitably reduce. Thus, I believe that long-standing members of the DAO that show sustainable participation of the DAO shall have more powers within the DAO. All in all, a natural selection of active and useful members will occur.
As for the voting itself, we need to avoid situations when big token holders, primarily investors, control the decision-making process. Instead, I would suggest that the DAO obliged them to distribute a part of their voting power to the recognised community members described in the previous paragraph.
Sample Voting Issue 2. FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement:

Split Reimbursement. The Defi protocols are designed to have reserves coming from transaction fees. These reserves should be used to cover possible hacks. If reserves could cover all losses then full reimbursement should take place. The general idea is that the amount to be covered should be equal to reserves.

Another aspect is the amount of funds in the Treasury. If the amount hack is not significant, the DAO may decide to use part of the treasury to cover losses in order to avoid reputation risks. On the other hand, if losses greatly exceed the Treasury, than using it to cover losses will just lead to skyrocketing dump of a governance token and closure of the project without any prospects, like it happened with FEI.
Languages I speak and write: English, Spanish.
Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
I testify that I will operate with Arbitrum’s best interest in mind. With this being said, I testify that I have no conflicts of interest that would prevent me from using my best judgement to operate in the best interests of advancing the Arbitrum ecosystem. If any occurs in the future, I will immediately notify the DAO.",574

Sample Voting Issue 1:

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding were fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also a concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:


How would you vote?
For


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?



Increase the number of seats on the allocation committee for other analytics service providers to ensure more diversity and competition.
Decrease the number of seats for Flipside on the allocation and oversight committees to avoid giving them too much control.
Have clear guidelines on how UNI tokens are allocated for bounties, and how Flipside’s role would be monitored to ensure fairness and transparency.


How would you approach the tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
My approach would depend on the context, a balance between centralization and decentralization may be the most effective. In this case, it may be important to weigh the potential benefits of Flipside’s involvement against the risks of centralization and aim for a more inclusive and diverse approach to governance.

Full Reimbursement

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
Generally, reimbursement could be considered in situations where the hack was a result of a vulnerability in the protocol or an external attack beyond the control of the users. In these cases, reimbursement could help restore trust in the protocol and encourage continued participation.
On the other hand, if the hack was a result of user error, such as sending funds to the wrong address or falling for a phishing scam, reimbursement may not be appropriate. In these cases, users may need to take responsibility for their own actions and learn from their mistakes.
Ultimately, the decision to reimburse parties in the event of an exploit is a complex and sensitive one that requires careful consideration of various factors, including the specifics of the hack, the values and priorities of the community, and the broader implications for the protocol’s security and integrity.

eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
Active on the Arbitrum blockchain for over a year it’s plain to see the Arbitrum team’s main focus has been the long term scalability of the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s been a privilege to watch a team engage with the community, build trust, and continuously deliver a product focused on the user, security, governance, and fostering innovation. I believe liquidity mining is a necessary evil to maintain the focus of our community past governance. Governance is not cool to the majority of the world, hell it even sounds like government. Until more users become active in a DAO community and truly see the power it wields, we will need to find alternative paths to keep our community engaged.

Uniswap Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?

Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Flipside has a clear approach and audience for obtaining new users, I would suggest outlining a clear budget for the year/years for onboarding users and assign strategies for each of the platforms in the running for funding. Then open the discussion up within commonwealth/tally to the entire community about the approaches each platform will be utilizing to onboard more users.
Winning strategies bring budgets as well as a KPI reporting strategy to be able to prove results quarterly to the DAO.
Budgets are revisited quarterly.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

Truth be told all missions align here, all the platforms want funding and UNI needs users. If the strategy for onboarding is carefully executed and monitored, then quickly scrapped and moved on to the next if not working, we will all be yielding new users to each of our platforms quickly. The authority should all be in agreement, the budget management should take care of the centralized authority issue.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It is difficult to find a compromise in such controversial situations. It’s hard for me to say whether there is any compromise solution at all in this proposal, but it seems to me that a public discussion is always the best solution in such matters. For this, DAO exists, sometimes one person and one non-standard thought is enough to find a compromise solution.


Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Split Reimbursement
In my opinion, there are many factors to consider when making such proposals. The most important of these are the damage to the protocol and the actual amount that can be allocated to compensate victims without having a critical impact on the protocol. It is almost always very difficult to recover the entire cost, so we must decide on the amount of payments that will most favorably affect the ecosystem.

Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?
Regarding the proposal, there are valid concerns about the level of control that Flipside would have over the allocation of UNI bounties and oversight of the program. Giving one analytics service provider a significant amount of power and influence over a program that affects the entire Uniswap community could be seen as centralization of authority and favoritism.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
If I were to suggest amendments to the proposal, I would recommend increasing the number of analytics service providers involved in the allocation committee and oversight committee to ensure a more diverse and inclusive decision-making process. Additionally, I would recommend that the allocation of UNI bounties be done through a transparent and objective system to prevent any potential bias or conflicts of interest.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
When it comes to the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, it’s important to strike a balance. While centralization of authority can help streamline decision-making processes, it can also lead to favoritism and a lack of representation. Therefore, it’s essential to involve multiple stakeholders in decision-making processes and ensure transparency and accountability to prevent potential abuses of power. Ultimately, the goal should be to achieve a fair and inclusive program that benefits the entire Uniswap community.

i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

Full Reimbursement
No Reimbursement
Split Reimbursement
This option would involve reimbursing affected parties for a portion of their losses, rather than the full amount. The main argument in favor of split reimbursement is that it could strike a balance between restoring user confidence and maintaining the principle that users should assume some responsibility for their own security. However, this approach could also create confusion and dissatisfaction if the split reimbursement is not perceived as fair or transparent.

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to reimburse parties affected by the Rari hack would depend on a range of factors, including legal and regulatory requirements, the impact on users and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, and the financial resources of the company. Some instances where it may be appropriate to reimburse users include cases where the hack was the result of a vulnerability in the platform’s code, or if the company failed to take appropriate security measures to protect user funds. On the other hand, instances where it may not be appropriate to reimburse users include cases where users were negligent in securing their own assets or if the hack was the result of a sophisticated and unpredictable attack.

Liquidity Mining Is A Process Where Users Provide Liquidity To A Decentralised Exchange Or Liquidity Pool & Receive Rewards In The Form Of Tokens. The Goal Of The DAO In Terms Of Liquidity Mining Is To Reward Users Who Provide Liquidity, Which In Turn Increases Liquidity & Trading Volume
The DAO’s Level Of Aggressiveness In Liquidity Mining Should Be Balanced With The General Risk Management Strategy Of The DAO. Liquidity Mining Is A Highly Profitable Move But Risky If Not Managed Properly.
The Basic Goal Of The DAO In Terms Of Liquidity Mining Are:
→ Generate Revenue For The DAO Through Transaction Fees Or Other Mechanisms
→ Attract & OnBoard New Users & Potential Investors To The Protocol
→ Grow Liquidity & Trading Volume For A Specific Token Or Protocol
→ Reward Users For Contributing To The Growth Of The Protocol By Providing Liquidity.

To Approach The Tradeoff Between Centralisation & Decentralisation, It Is Important To Consider The Specific Needs And Goals Of The Organisation. For Example, If The Organisation Is Focused On Innovation & Creativity, A More Decentralised Approach May Be More Effective In Promoting Diverse perspectives and ideas. However, If The Organisation Is Focused On Efficiency & Productivity, A More Centralised Approach May Be More Effective In Streamlining Decision-Making & Avoiding Unnecessary Delays.
Potential Risk & Benefits Of Both Approaches Should Be Considered i.e  A  Highly Centralised Organisation May Be More Vulnerable To Corruption Or Mismanagement Of Power, While A Highly Decentralised Organisation May Struggle To Co-Ordinate Efforts & Achieve Consensus.

My stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The DAO`s goal should be distributing all decision making power over as many people as possible and securing the treasury as well as the infrastructure. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.

 Overall goals for the DAO:

Arbitrum DAO should strive for a robust, transparent governance process with engaged delegates from varied points of view and walks of life.
The DAO must effectively manage the community treasury for the short and long term. Important discussions will need to be had around the pace of spending the $ARB that is held by the DAO.


Liquidity Mining

I am more in favor of providing incentives to projects, with stipulations that they will distribute the $ARB to their users, etc. To me, designing for this “rising tide” effect achieves two things: 1) it promotes/bootstraps Arbitrum-native projects and 2) it brings liquidity on established projects to Arbitrum (i.e. Curve uses $ARB allocation to incentivize Arbitrum pools).
As a long-time farmer and on-chain participant, I am certainly not opposed to liquidity mining but I would like to see how things go over the first few days. Speculation around the $ARB airdrop has already brought a lot of interest into the ecosystem and there might be better uses of capital than heavily incentivizing a LM program.



 Sample Issue 1: Uniswap

How would you vote?: Against

The proposal was confusing to me at the time and still remains so. The proposal offers an overly complicated, meatspace-heavy scheme that could bring on more problems than it solves (esp. regulatory as Uniswap dealing with a U.S. entity in Flipside).
Just because the DAO has a lot of money doesn’t mean it needs to A) spend it all at once and B) not look at the bill someone charges you for their services 


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

I would suggest rethinking the problem the DAO is trying to solve for. If the DAO is committed to this type of approach, I would suggest adding new/additional non-partial members to the oversight committee.
I’d also consider allowing other projects/companies to bid on doing the same type of work and allowing the DAO to choose which provider they preferred.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

I am generally in favor of the “Pod” type structures that have been emerging. I believe a DAO needs to give people certain centralized authority to get things done, but it is important to scrupulously limit the scope of that authority.



 Sample Issue 2: Fei-Rari Hack

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

First and foremost, I believe that DAO votes and decisions need to be maximally binding from both a social and technical standpoint - otherwise the system falls apart as seen in the Rari example. A rug pull on a vote with that level of consequence is absolutely unacceptable.



Should parties be reimbursed for an explot? Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
It very much depends on the nature of the situation:

Was it an economic exploit or was it a hack?
Where will the funds for reimbursement come from?? Token inflation? A pre-established emergency fund for possible exploits? Socialization of losses by taking funds from un-impacted users/pools?
Ultimately I think users should take responsibility for the risks they take when using nascent protocols, however when there are economically viable ways to reduce user losses during extreme/catastrophic instances, it is certainly something that warrants consideration.
Socializing losses could be a viable plan but it would depend on the nature of the circumstances.

It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

If I were a delegate, I would oppose the current Uniswap proposal. Although I think that bounties could be a useful method for drawing new users to Uniswap, the proposal grants Flipside crypto excessive authority over the distribution of UNI tokens and management of the initiative. I believe this could result in a concentration of power and an unjust advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
I think it’s important to remember that the decision to reimburse parties affected by an exploit can have far-reaching implications for the community as a whole. It’s important to strike a balance between protecting the interests of those affected by the hack and ensuring the long-term viability and sustainability of the platform. As a delegate, I would work to facilitate a constructive dialogue between all stakeholders and to ensure that all perspectives are taken into account when making decisions related to reimbursement.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Gaming development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
In my mind, the overarching goal of the DAO is to strive for growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem while ensuring decentralization. Liquidity mining is a tool used for short term growth that can be helpful in the early stages of development to get users in the door, but it needs to be paired with aggressive development and continued improvements of the underlining protocols to ensure new user retention. It is not something to rely on long term, but can be useful for short term stimulation of adoption.
Sample Voting Issue 1: Uniswap/Flipside Bounty
1. How would you vote?
For, pending amendments
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
When considering the voting power of Flipside on the allocation committee and the Oversight committee, I find it helpful to think in percentages. No single group or individual should have more than 30% voting power, preferably less than 20%. With this in mind I would propose an adjustment to the number of seats on both committees along with the number allocated to Flipside. For the allocation committee 2 of 10 seats seems more reasonable, and for the Oversight committee I believe 1 of 5 seats is reasonable. This would give Flipside 20% of the voting power in both committees.
Also, @Oxytocin brought up a great suggestion regarding separating grants into quarterly distributions that I agree with.


Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.


Kudos  
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
There’s a fine line to walk between the fairness and inclusivity of decentralization and the efficiency of centralization. I believe that the decision making process around the direction of the ecosystem needs to maintain a high degree of decentralization to ensure our path forward stays in the best interest of the majority. However, I also believe that the execution of projects and goals can be delegated to trusted third parties within the ecosystem that operate in a more centralized manner provided there is true transparency and frequent check-ins on progress.
Sample Voting Issue 2: RARI Hack Reimbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

Split Reimbursement
I understand that Defi is risky, but at this stage I don’t feel like zero reimbursement makes sense. Hacks are a major reason for lack of adoption and we need to be doing everything we can to prevent losses and encourage the development and adoption of insurance protocols. We need to be fostering a sense of safety, collaboration, and shared responsibility within the ecosystem. Without the aid of insurance, I feel that the pain and losses from a hack should be shared between a protocols treasury/investors and the depositors if the losses are too great for the treasury to handle on its own.

I am most interested in supporting infrastructure and tools that improve protocol decentralization.
Obtaining liquidity is a well-known policy applied by the DAO in order to stimulate the general liquidity providers as well as the fees of members of the company due to investing in the platform. The hostility of mining liquidity is able to be dependent with a fuller DAO as well as risk tolerance. The most hostile aspect to the extraction of liquidity can cause the most rapid increase, however, someone is also able to increase volatility as well as dangers.
Past problems plowed in other societies have every chance to be very different, but many of the same ones contain fears under the pretext of transparency, governance and security. DAOs have every chance to find a solution to these difficulties by introducing colorless actions, making conclusions, reliable security protocols, as well as management structures controlled by society.
In full, the mission of the DAO as well as the aspect to the extraction of liquidity are obliged to meet the needs as well as the values of its society. DAOs have every chance to get benefits
Sample voting question 1 - UniSwap / Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
The devolution of the voice follows for the purpose of this, in order for each DAO to have the opportunity to work effectively in a long-term opportunity. Notwithstanding in such a case that this gives a certain level of centralization, as long as they do not control an excessive share of the largest DAO in any way and also if they have satisfied accountability measures, this is an excellent activity.
What amendments would you make to the proposal, if any?
Divide the Grants into Quarterly Allocations: The Presence of the Twenty-Five Million Allotment We don’t think it makes sense to simply split it into 1st and 2nd time. it is more accurate to have a reserve in advance, however, taking into account that the only advantage of delivering such amounts the only once in a time is the saving of a period in transaction and communication, it may seem at first glance that the distribution of appropriations according to the last edge in three-month distributions would have been more rational.
Introduce audit seats throughout the entire delegation phase: in addition to the committee dealing with urgent issues bundled with the grant, it would be preferable to also introduce a simple referendum to ensure that the DAO continues to satisfy this huge emphasis. This would also force the grantee to increase accountability and also show evidence of accountability.
How would you approach a compromise between centralization to government and the ability to achieve a mission?
Inevitably, efficiency and decentralization are inversely related. As long as centralized objects are still ultimately dependent on DAO approval and operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for DAO development.
DAO should consider centralizing points only when specialists need to act well and quickly, which Vox Populi DAO may face. Entities for this, of course, must be trusted members of the space.
Sample Poll Question 2 - Rari Hack Reimbursement
How would you decide to act in this situation, except for the coup of votes?
Please specify in which cases you consider compensation to be correct and in which it is not.
i.e. should the parties be compensated for the exploit or not?
Break-ins and loss of money in the current period are considered one of the most significant barriers that I have with people trusting a place and also moving into it. Any time, if a significant exhaustion of rough contracts is made, the concept of economic Lego has turned out to be near danger, since society is without exception less and less willing to put itself at risk by connecting to other protocols.
According to this circumstance, we think that, according to the last facet, incomplete secondary funding is constantly to be considered if the act has decided to contribute together with you. These regions have decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, as well as their loyalty to the process and the mutual trust shown by the protocol, to be thanked, according to the last facet, by trying to return a share of the money. In the future, this is also capable of being processed along with support for DAO insurance protocols, which are previously developed in place.
However, no less, we would not have decided to provide an absolute secondary download, if hacking earlier in this way would greatly affect the act. In the event that the aggregate does not in any way become of significant significance for the purpose of the final result, it is important to provide secondary subsidies, however, in this particular case, the dual impact of the hack was so significant that this plunged to 1 from the 1st situation DAO obviously closes the door . Ten Absolute secondary application together with the place of view of influence will become similar after all, as well as the 2nd one is so disastrous cracking.
Split Reimbursement
TL; DR Give the necessary compensation in order to express gratitude to the contributors due to the contribution to the concept, however, despite the fact that absolute secondary funding can help these stakeholders, the results of this impact have every chance to cause this, then the DAO will enter into a negative destructive spring.

The goal of the DAO is to ensure healthy and decentralized development of the project, including technical security and creating a healthy ecosystem. The DAO should ask itself what solution can ensure the long-term sustainability and success of the project.
There are several possible roles that the DAO can take, such as technical protocols and security updates, liquidity programs, and grant issuance. It is important that the DAO’s decisions reflect the interests and values of the entire ecosystem, and that transparency and social trust are maintained.
A balance must be maintained between centralizing power and the ability to achieve goals, and the DAO should strive for a balanced approach.
The DAO should be transparent, inclusive, and responsibly manage resources and assets, while delegates should strive to work in the interests of the entire community, with special attention paid to creating a sustainable and adaptive ecosystem.

Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.

I would suggest reducing the number of seats on the allocation committee and oversight committee assigned to Flipside or involving other analytics service providers in the proposal.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
While centralization can expedite decision-making, it can also lead to conflicts of interest and favoritism. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between centralization and decentralization and ensure that decision-making power is distributed fairly among all stakeholders.

I believe parties affected by an exploit should be reimbursed if the exploit was not due to their negligence or fault. In this case, I would support full reimbursement for those affected by the Rari hack. The criteria for determining whether a party is eligible for a refund should be transparently defined and consistently applied.

I work closely with onchain DAOs across the Ethereum ecosystem in my role at Tally. I believe I can be a valuable contributor to Arbitrum’s governance process/metagovernance. I’m a long-time power user of Arbitrum and Ethereum, so I know the community well and am excited to bring long-term value to the DAO in my role as a delegate!

The DAO should be focused on 1. Responsibly growing the Arbitrum ecosystem and 2. Ensuring safe protocol upgrades. We should be aggressive in deploying treasury funds to incentivize high-quality builders to build unique, valuable products on Arbitrum. We should incentivize technical teams in the Ethereum ecosystem to contribute to Arbitrum One and other protocol infrastructure. We should allocate significant effort and energy towards ensuring all Constitutional Governor proposals are safe. We should seek to progressively increase the decentralization of the DAO as the protocol hardens (e.g. permissionless Fraud Proofs, slowly removing admin capabilities of the security council), permissionless validation.

How would you vote? I would vote against the proposal.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any? I would push to broaden the proposal to include multiple service providers.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done? I think onchain DAO proposals should be comprehensive, thoughtful, and significant. There should be extensive social alignment that occurs via the forum and other venues before a proposal is submitted onchain. The social alignment should be transparent (in this case, multiple service providers should have had the chance to participate). Major initiatives should be funded in such a way that all major aspects of the program can be accomplished.

The first vote in this case was a social poll (Snapshot) and did not include onchain executability. I generally do not think social polls are enforceable, and should not be considered binding (because they aren’t).

For Public Goods funding, the DAO can prioritize supporting projects that provide benefits to the wider cryptocurrency community and beyond. This can be achieved by setting up a transparent and fair process for selecting and evaluating projects to be funded.
For DeFi development on Arbitrum, the DAO can work towards expanding the platform’s capabilities, improving its efficiency, and making it more accessible to a wider user base. The focus should be on developing innovative financial products using the Arbitrum network.
For NFT development on Arbitrum, the DAO can support developers in creating non-fungible tokens with unique use cases that leverage the benefits of arbitrage technology.
For Gaming development on Arbitrum, the DAO can prioritize funding game development projects that leverage the benefits of scalability and low transaction fees that come with using Arbitrum.
For Improving Governance participation, the DAO can engage its members in decision-making processes and encourage active participation in shaping the future of the DAO. This can be achieved by setting up an incentivization structure that rewards members for their contributions.
For Supporting Infrastructure and Tooling, the DAO can work towards building a robust ecosystem around Arbitrum by providing infrastructure and tooling support. This will help developers and users to interact with the network more easily and will attract more people to join the ecosystem.
For Improving protocol decentralization, the DAO can work towards ensuring that the protocol remains decentralized and encourages community participation in governance decisions.
For IRL Arbitrum community gatherings, the DAO can organize events to bring the community together, share ideas and network.
In terms of the overall goals for the DAO, setting up a clear and measurable vision is important. The DAO can aim to become a leading force in the cryptocurrency space that supports innovative projects, fosters community involvement and contributes to the overall growth and adoption of blockchain technology. The liquidity mining strategy can be aggressive but should be sustainable to ensure the long-term success of the DAO.",619

My goal is to encourage a decentralized protocol and have a fair and consistent governance.
ISSUE 1:
How would I vote?
1: I am against this proposal
2: A possible proposal to suggest would be to restructure allocation and oversight committees to ensure a more balanced distribution of power among different stakeholders, such as UNI holders, university clubs, and other analytics service providers.
Additionally, it may be beneficial to consider involving other analytics service providers in the program, so that there is more competition and a greater diversity of perspectives. This could also help to ensure that the best possible bounties are created and allocated, and that there is no favoritism towards one particular service provider.
3: Regarding the tradeoff between the centralization and the ability to get things done, it is essential to find the balance between the two. A centralized structure would certainly streamline decision making and increase efficiency, but this allows abuse of power and lack of accountability to manifest. Solutions include establishing checks and balances to prevent any one entity from having too much control. To address these concerns, transparency and democratic process that involves multiple stakeholders can help ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of the community as a whole.
ISSUE 2:
I would handle this with the third option.
Split Reimbursement: This option could strike a balance between the two previous options, where the protocol could reimburse a portion of the losses incurred by users, and users could bear some of the responsibility. However, determining a fair split could be challenging, and it may not satisfy all parties.
Ideally, a consistent reinbursement policy should be established beforehand.
It should consist of
Eligibility criteria: Clearly state who is eligible for reimbursement based on specific criteria.
Reimbursement process: Describe how affected users can request reimbursement and the process for processing and disbursing reimbursements.

Reimbursement formula: Specify the formula or method used to calculate the reimbursement amount for affected users.

Funding source: Identify the source of funding for reimbursements, such as an insurance pool, reserve fund, or community fund.

Communication plan: Outline a plan for communicating the reimbursement program to affected users and the wider community.

Governance: Clarify the decision-making process for making reimbursement decisions, including the role of the community, protocol team, and other stakeholders.

Supporting Infrastructure
Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The goal of the DAO should be growing the Arbitrum network as safely as possible, with utmost care being taken to focus on staying decentralized. L2 solutions are going to be the backbone of Ethereum’s ability to scale in the near future, so it is important when voting on AIPs to consider how they will affect both the Arbitrum protocol as well as the L2 ecosystem as a whole.
I believe liquidity mining is a useful tool to attract users, however incentives should look to stay about in-line with other platforms. Enough to sustain user growth, but not going overboard to create an over-reliance on something that is not a permanent solution.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
I would vote “For” with an amendment to reduce the number of Flipside committee members to 2 of 7. I believe this strikes a fair balance between giving Flipside a bigger say in votes without pushing the boundaries of centralization risk. In a 3 of 7 scenario where the 3 Flipside members become bad actors, it would only take one additional person to put the project at risk. While there is technically a tradeoff of in efficiencies, I believe that a group of 7 should be small enough to not be a major issue.
I also believe a discussion on the payment periods is warranted. Given the size and scope of the project, quarterly / semi-annual payouts may have been more appropriate.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
I am not well versed enough in the FEI RARI hack to speak specifically about it. Hack reimbursement comes down to very specific case-by-case determinations. Who is at fault? What are the broad-reaching consequences? How will this affect growth in the future?
Given the importance of L2s to Ethereum’s scalability, if non-reimbursement would cause a shutdown of the protocol (or scare away enough users to effectively kill it) I would likely vote ‘Yes’ to a full or partial reimbursement. Much beyond a complete collapse of Arbitrum, I’d likely be voting no. I think a very delicate balance has to be struck on these decisions. Bailing out may be necessary to keep users who would otherwise abandon the project around, but there is a real chance of subsidizing risky behavior. If projects being built on Arbitrum start cutting corners because they think they will get a bailout anyway, it would put at risk the safety of the network in totality as development shifts far to fast and loose.
I think Ethereum’s DAO hack back in 2016, and subsequent handlings of hacks, are basically in line with my views.
Languages I speak and write: English
Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
I am also a HOP delegate, which is a protocol that bridges L2 protocols together. Arbitrum is one of the L2 protocols available to bridge.

The aggressiveness of liquidity mining and the goals of a DAO will depend on the specific context and objectives of the organization. Generally, liquidity mining is a strategy used to incentivize users to provide liquidity to a decentralized exchange or liquidity pool by offering rewards in the form of tokens or other assets. The goal of a DAO may be to maximize the liquidity of its associated token or asset by encouraging users to provide liquidity, thereby increasing trading volume and demand.
However, there are several factors to consider when determining how aggressive to be in liquidity mining. One important factor is the overall liquidity of the token or asset being incentivized. If the token or asset is already highly liquid, then there may not be a need for aggressive liquidity mining strategies. On the other hand, if the token or asset is relatively illiquid, then more aggressive liquidity mining strategies may be necessary to attract users and increase liquidity.
Another factor to consider is the cost of liquidity mining. In order to incentivize users to provide liquidity, a DAO may need to allocate a significant amount of its tokens or assets as rewards. This can be expensive, and it may be necessary to balance the costs of liquidity mining with the potential benefits.
Ultimately, the goal of a DAO should be to maximize the long-term value of its associated token or asset. This may require a balance between aggressive liquidity mining strategies and more conservative approaches, depending on the specific context and objectives of the organization. It is important for a DAO to carefully consider the costs and benefits of liquidity mining and to continually assess and adjust its strategies as needed.

Increase transparency and accountability: To address concerns about centralization of power and oversight by a single service provider, the proposal could be modified to include more transparency and accountability measures. For example, the allocation committee could be expanded to include more stakeholders, such as representatives from other analytics service providers or community members, and the decision-making process could be made more transparent through regular reporting and updates.
Balance control among stakeholders: The allocation of UNI tokens could be controlled by a more diverse group of stakeholders to ensure a fair and balanced approach. This could be achieved by giving a more equal number of seats to Flipside and other analytics service providers, or by involving additional stakeholders in the decision-making process.
Clarify the program’s goals: To ensure that the program aligns with the goals of the Uniswap community, it may be beneficial to clarify the program’s objectives and how they align with the overall mission and values of Uniswap. This could help to ensure that the program is focused on adding value to the Uniswap ecosystem and promoting decentralization.
Seek input from the community: To address concerns raised by community members, it may be beneficial to seek input and feedback from a wider range of stakeholders, such as community members, traders, and liquidity providers. This could be done through town hall meetings, online surveys, or other engagement mechanisms.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
3、Split Reimbursement
there are several factors to consider when determining whether or not to provide reimbursement:

Severity of the exploit: The severity of the hack is an important factor to consider. If the hack resulted in significant losses for users, then there may be a stronger case for reimbursement.
Responsibility: It is also important to consider who is responsible for the exploit. If the exploit was due to a vulnerability in the platform or a mistake on the part of the developers, then there may be a stronger case for reimbursement. However, if the exploit was due to user error or negligence, then the case for reimbursement may be weaker.
Impact on the ecosystem: The impact of the hack on the ecosystem is another important factor to consider. If the hack has a significant negative impact on the overall health and viability of the ecosystem, then there may be a case for reimbursement in order to restore confidence and stability.

In the specific case of the FEI RARI hack, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer without knowing more about the specifics of the situation. However, generally speaking, splitting the reimbursement between affected parties could be a possible solution. This would help to provide some compensation to those affected by the hack without placing an undue burden on the platform or the community as a whole.",626

If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:
Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.
These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!

A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and also take into account their survival, therefore it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, by literally draining their funds I do not think they can pay.
That’s why I think the best thing to do, and depending on the case like FEI, is to return money to those affected, maybe under a vesting system or the DAO can get down to work to look after the interests of its users.
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

.Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will obviously be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionaly, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which although is also part of the wider ethereum ecosystem it could be considered a conflict of interest. Currently, I am being allocated ~ 1k OP. In addition to this, ParaSwap has also been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme recipients, and if necessary, the representative of ParaSwap could be a different DAO member if this is considered a major conflict of interest. Personally, I believe that the growth of any decentralised rollup on the Ethereum ecosystem is a net positive for everyone in the space, and I will do my best to lend my knowledge in bettering the entire space",630

Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO, if a small group centralizes power, the name DAO is only an aggregate.
Something that can help is to predefine in the beginning the creation of committees and delimit the members it should have at the expense of increasing diversity against personal interests.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is a bad reference to the DAOs, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree, but I feel that the committees or delegates fulfill that vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize the governance processes.

Improving Governance participation


Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.


Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

3.The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a common challenge for any organization, including DAOs. On one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear leadership and decision-making, leading to faster execution and more efficient use of resources. On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision-making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of the wider community.

● In what area do I most want to contribute?
 - Financing of public goods
 - Improve participation in governance
● My position on the general objectives of the DAO:
I am convinced that the financing of public goods is generally undervalued in terms of financing, although this is an important point that should not be overlooked.
It is clear that public goods are indispensable resources that must be considered in proportion to what they bring in terms of value as well as for their roles played in the growth of the ecosystem.
In this sense, I think it is therefore imperative to create incentive solutions that would make it possible to reward public goods at their fair value and I think that the Arbitrum foundation is capable of enabling this mission to be accomplished in the general interest.
● MY ANALYSYS ON VOTING PROBLEM 1:

QUESTION 1: How would you vote?

Regarding Uniswap’s proposal to use Flipside to attract new users via bounties, it is important to consider the pros and cons of the proposal to determine whether one should vote for or against.
Voting FOR, therefore, would mean approving Uniswap’s proposal to use Flipside to attract new users.
Benefits of this approach include the ability to attract new users and expand Uniswap’s user base.
To vote AGAINST would be to reject Uniswap’s proposal to use Flipside to attract new users.
The disadvantages of this approach include the centralization of power and the favor of a single service provider.
Additionally, the allocation of seats on the Allocations and Oversight Committee gives Flipside disproportionate control over the program, which may worry some community members.
Finally, the fact that other analytics service providers are not involved in the proposal can be seen as a disadvantage, as it may reduce diversity and competition in the analytics services market.
● CONCLUSION
Ultimately, the choice to vote FOR or AGAINST will depend on the individual priorities of each member of the Uniswap community.
If increasing the number of users is considered the top priority, then a vote FOR may be warranted.
However, if decentralization of power and diversity of analytics service providers are considered more important, an AGAINST vote may be warranted.
● MY PERSONAL CHOICE
I will have voted AGAINST this proposal, which does not correspond to my way of seeing governance.

QUESTION 2: What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

To this question, I will answer that I will ask for the establishment of a counter proposal in order to maintain the initial proposal by simply reducing control over the allocation of UNI to premiums and monitoring of the entire program.

QUESTION 3: How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

This is both an interesting question and a complicated problem to solve…
To address this trade-off, it is important to understand that centralization and decentralization are not mutually exclusive approaches. In reality, it is often necessary to find a balance between these two approaches to achieve optimal results.
Ultimately, the trade-off between centralization and decentralization will depend on the organization’s goals and the specific circumstances of each situation. It is important to tailor approaches as needed and find a balance that maximizes the benefits of each approach while minimizing the drawbacks.
● My approaches would be:
 - Clearly define roles and responsibilities, in order to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings.
 - Foster collaboration in a decentralized way that gives individuals and groups more freedom to experiment and come up with new ideas.
 - Promote the participation of all members of the organization in the decision-making process in order to help generate a feeling of belonging and responsibility, and to obtain a consensus around the decisions made.
● MY ANALYSYS ON VOTING PROBLEM 2:
When it comes to refunding the Rari hack, it is important to consider the specific circumstances of the incident as well as the implications of any refund decision.
The three possible options to handle this situation are: full refund, no refund and split refund.
 - FULL REIMBURSEMENT:
If the full refund option is chosen, it means that all parties that were affected by the hack would be refunded in full.
This option can be considered the fairest, as the affected parties have not chosen to suffer losses due to a criminal act.
However, it can also be costly for the organization and could potentially encourage irresponsible behavior on the part of users in the future, knowing that they will be reimbursed in the event of a hack.
 - NO REIMBURSEMENT:
The option of not reimbursing affected parties can be considered the fairest for the organization, as it does not bear the costs of losses incurred by users.
However, it can also lead to a loss of user confidence in the organization and therefore a loss of value for the whole system.
 - SPLIT REIMBURSEMENT:
The option of partially reimbursing affected parties can be seen as an interim solution, which can be fair to affected parties while limiting costs to the organization.
This option can also encourage users to be more careful in their use of the platform, knowing that they will not be fully reimbursed in the event of a hack.
● CONCLUSION
Ultimately, choosing the best option will depend on the specific circumstances of the incident, as well as the long-term goals of the organization.
If the organization wants to maintain the trust of its users, full refund might be considered the best option. However, if the organization is looking to contain costs while addressing user concerns, a split reimbursement might be a better option.
In all cases, it is important to clearly communicate the reasons for the decision taken and to work with the affected parties to find a solution that is fair and acceptable to all.
● MY PERSONAL CHOICE:
I will therefore opt for the split reimbursement, but only, if the funds of the project allow it.
● LANGUAGES THAT I SPEAK AND WRITE:
French, Chinese English, Spanish.
● STATEMENT OF NO CONFLICT(S) OF INTEREST:
I affirm that I have no conflict of interest that would prevent me from using my judgment to operate in the interest of the Arbitrum ecosystem.",634

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
My overall objective as a potential delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain is to encourage the expansion and development of the community while making sure that the interests of all participants are represented. To do this, I think the DAO should give priority to programs that promote liquidity and motivate involvement from a variety of stakeholders.
Whilst I think it should be done wisely and with a long-term perspective, liquidity mining can be a potent instrument for encouraging participation and creating momentum. To build a durable and robust ecosystem that can withstand market volatility and adjust to changing circumstances, in my opinion, should be the DAO’s main objective.
Considering the problems that have been brought up in other communities, I think it’s critical to adopt a proactive and cooperative strategy for resolving conflicts and fostering trust. We can foster a culture of collaboration and mutual benefit by communicating respectfully and constructively with members of different communities. This is advantageous for all parties concerned.
My position on these matters is ultimately determined by my dedication to openness, diversity, and prudent management of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. I would give my all as a delegate to make sure that the community’s interests are protected and that the DAO endures and expands over time.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
I would vote against the Uniswap plan in its current form as a delegate. Even though I think bounties can be a good method to draw new users to Uniswap, the plan gives Flipside Crypto too much influence over how UNI is distributed and how the program is run. In my opinion, this might result in a concentration of power and give Flipside an unfair advantage.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
The Rari hack reimbursement scenario, in my opinion as a delegate, is a complicated matter that calls for serious thought and a nuanced response. While I feel for people who were impacted by the hack, I think it’s crucial to thoroughly consider the advantages and disadvantages of reimbursement.
According to me, a variety of considerations, such as the severity of the exploit, its effects on the community, and the viability of reimbursement, should be taken into account when determining whether or not to compensate parties who were harmed by an exploit. In some circumstances, complete compensation might be justified, especially if the exploit was very harmful or the result of a platform-wide problem.
However, in other cases, a full refund may not be possible or appropriate.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision to compensate a party affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific circumstances of each situation. As a member of the community, I strive to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are fairly represented and that decisions are made transparently and responsibly.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Decentralization: A key goal of DAOs is to promote decentralization by utilizing blockchain technology. This enables a distributed network of participants to collectively manage and make decisions without relying on a central authority.
Transparency: DAOs aim to create a transparent ecosystem, ensuring that all decisions, financial transactions, and governance processes are visible and verifiable to all members.
Efficiency: Through automation and smart contracts, DAOs seek to eliminate unnecessary intermediaries and reduce operational costs, making organizations more efficient and lean.
Inclusion: By allowing anyone to participate in the decision-making process, DAOs encourage a more inclusive and diverse community of stakeholders.
Innovation: DAOs typically focus on driving innovation by funding and supporting cutting-edge projects, research, or technologies that advance the common good of the community.
Sustainability: DAOs will likely emphasize long-term sustainability, aiming to create an autonomous, adaptive, and resilient ecosystem that can thrive in the ever-changing blockchain and decentralized technology landscape.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
votes in favor of the proposal：
Allocation of funds: The DAO will allocate a predetermined amount of funds to support projects and ideas that emerge from the UniSwap/Flipside bounty program.
Encouraging innovation: By supporting the bounty program, the DAO will encourage developers and community members to come up with innovative solutions and ideas that enhance the UniSwap platform.
Strengthening the ecosystem: Participation in the bounty program will help to strengthen the relationship between the DAO, UniSwap, and the broader decentralized ecosystem.
Enhancing the DAO’s reputation: Involvement in the UniSwap/Flipside bounty program will showcase the DAO’s commitment to supporting innovative projects and fostering growth within the decentralized ecosystem.
If the DAO votes against the proposal, the funds will not be allocated to participate in the UniSwap/Flipside bounty program, and the DAO will miss out on potential opportunities for growth and collaboration with UniSwap and Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Issue Overview:
Rari Capital, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, experienced a security breach, resulting in a significant loss of user funds. To protect its users and maintain trust in the ecosystem, Rari Capital is proposing a reimbursement plan to compensate affected users.
Proposal:
The proposal is for the DAO  to support the Rari Hack Reimbursement initiative by allocating a portion of its funds to help reimburse affected users. This action demonstrates the DAO’s commitment to transparency, accountability, and the overall health of the decentralized ecosystem.
DAO votes in favor of the proposal：
Allocation of funds: The DAO will allocate a predetermined amount of funds to support the reimbursement of affected Rari Capital users.
Restoring trust: By backing the reimbursement plan, the DAO can help restore trust in the Rari Capital platform and the broader decentralized ecosystem.
Strengthening relationships: Supporting Rari Capital in this challenging situation can foster stronger relationships within the community and demonstrate the DAO’s commitment to collaboration and mutual support.
Enhancing the DAO’s reputation: Participation in the Rari Hack Reimbursement initiative showcases the DAO’s commitment to user protection and maintaining a healthy, transparent decentralized ecosystem.
If the DAO votes against the proposal, the funds will not be allocated to support the Rari Hack Reimbursement initiative, and the DAO may miss out on potential opportunities to strengthen relationships and enhance its reputation within the decentralized ecosystem.
It is essential for the DAO members to weigh the potential benefits and risks associated with the proposal before casting their vote. The decision should be based on a thorough analysis of the proposal and its alignment with the DAO’s mission and overall goals.

Позиция по ранее поднятым проблемам в других сообществах: я считаю, что важно тщательно учитывать опасения и отзывы различных сообществ и применять совместный подход к решению этих проблем.
Пример вопроса голосования 1:
я бы проголосовал за план Uniswap в его нынешнем виде в качестве делегата. Так как я думаю, что награды могут быть хорошим способом привлечь новых пользователей в Uniswap, план дает Flipside Crypto слишком большое влияние на то, как UNI распространяется и как работает программа.
Как бы вы проголосовали?
за
Какие поправки вы бы внесли в предложение, если таковые имеются?
Разнообразие мнений и участников должно быть основной целью ДАО, если небольшая группа централизует власть, название ДАО — это только название.
Как бы вы подошли к компромиссу между централизацией власти и способностью добиваться цели?
Это плохо для DAO, чем более децентрализовано, тем труднее договориться, но я чувствую, что комитеты или делегаты выполняют эту жизненно важную функцию представления голоса многих для оптимизации процессов управления.
Пример вопроса голосования 2:
Сценарий возмещения расходов на взлом Rari, по моему мнению, как делегату, является сложным вопросом, требующим серьезного обдумывания и детального ответа. Хотя я сочувствую людям, пострадавшим от взлома, я считаю крайне важным тщательно рассмотреть преимущества и недостатки возмещения расходов.
По моему мнению, различные соображения, такие как тяжесть эксплойта, его влияние на сообщество и возможность возмещения, должны быть приняты во внимание при определении того, следует ли компенсировать сторонам, пострадавшим от эксплойта. В некоторых случаях может быть оправдана полная компенсация, особенно если эксплойт был очень опасным или являлся результатом проблемы, затрагивающей всю платформу.
Однако в других случаях полный возврат средств может быть невозможен или нецелесообразно.
В конечном счете, я считаю, что решение о компенсации стороне, пострадавшей от эксплойта, должно приниматься в каждом конкретном случае с учетом конкретных обстоятельств каждой ситуации. Как член сообщества я стремлюсь к тому, чтобы интересы всех членов сообщества были справедливо представлены, а решения принимались прозрачно и ответственно.
Раздельное возмещение
ДАО должен обеспечить наилучшие условия для своих членов, а также учитывать их выживание, поэтому это будет во многом зависеть от случаев и типа взлома, буквально истощая их средства, я не думаю, что они могут заплатить.
Вот почему я думаю, что лучше всего, и в зависимости от случая, такого как FEI, вернуть деньги пострадавшим, возможно, в рамках системы наделения правами, или DAO может приступить к работе, чтобы заботиться об интересах своих пользователей.

Overall stance:
Overall Goals for the DAO:
My stance is that the DAO should aim for sustainable growth by balancing aggressive liquidity mining with long-term value creation. The primary goal should be to maintain a healthy ecosystem that fosters innovation and collaboration while preventing concentration of power and undue influence.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Vote: Against
Amendments: I would suggest a more balanced allocation committee by reducing Flipside’s representation and including other analytics service providers. Additionally, the oversight committee should have more diverse and independent stakeholders to ensure fairness.
Approach to Centralization vs. Efficiency: It is crucial to strike a balance between centralization and efficiency. By involving multiple stakeholders, we can foster a decentralized decision-making process while maintaining the ability to get things done through collaboration and consensus.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Choice: Split Reimbursement
Handling the Situation: I believe in split reimbursement, providing partial compensation to affected parties. This approach acknowledges the responsibility of the platform without fostering a moral hazard. The reimbursement percentage should be determined based on the extent to which the platform’s negligence contributed to the exploit.
Refunding Instances: I believe reimbursements are appropriate when platform vulnerabilities are the primary cause of the exploit and when the platform had prior knowledge of the vulnerability but failed to address it. Reimbursements should not be provided in cases of user negligence or external factors unrelated to the platform’s security.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The DAO should serve as the primary support and shepherd to the Arbitrum network and community. The DAO, as the largest stakeholder in the Arbitrum network, should be monitoring the constellation of dapps for endogenous risk building up in the system, protect the decentralization of Arbitrum governance, and manage the DAO treasury as to benefit Arbitrum’s growth and community. As we’ve seen across a multitude of examples these past few years alone, the adversarial nature of blockchains can lead to worst case outcomes for entire chains and communities. Everything from algorithmic death spirals, and large hacks, to traditional banking partner counter-party risk, and toxic assets in DAO treasuries has led to existential risk recently for both blockchains and the applications built on top of them. The DAO, as the largest Arbitrum community member, should serve as the main defense and, if necessary, support of the Arbitrum network and community as a whole. For example, we’ve seen in the cases of Lido and Convex (both of which I support for their contributions) protocols being able to amass enough governance power as to threaten the decentralization initially intended. Something like this could be, and has been, done as an attack against a blockchain, protocol, community; and Offchain Labs can’t be expected to be constantly monitoring for edge risks or expected to threaten the future viability of the Arbitrum project by dipping into team funds. It is my hope to grow the DAO into a proactive community member feeding off of the collective intelligence of all those value-aligned.
I believe the DAO should incentivize liquidity mining but be measured in further distributing control of governance away from the DAO while the network is young and growing rapidly. Since the current distribution requires that a small majority of community members vote alongside the DAO to pass a vote, the DAO should maintain this ratio and only allocate to liquidity mining tokens such that only a small majority of community members voting alongside the DAO are required to pass a vote.
Sample Voting Issue 1:


How would you vote?
Against
Almost forty three percent of the decision as to where UNI would be allocated would not be in the hands of anyone provably aligned with the UNI community. One of three seats on the oversight committee means they’d only have to corrupt one individual to gain out-sized power over UNI holders.


I would amend the proposal to only allocate them 1/7 seats on the allocation committee and no seats on the oversight committee. The reasoning being: the other six members of the allocation committee are presumably aligned with the best interests of UNI holders, and, in the event of an even split, Flipside (as an entity aiming to make profit generating a service) can be trusted err on the side of caution with their limited power and vote in a manner that benefits their customer and helps them continue to generate revenue.


I would approach tradeoffs between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done by always deferring to the principles of community and decentralization. Existential threats should warrant extreme measures. I can imagine an event where the DAO is asked to give up a significant percentage of voting power to a centralized actor. In my opinion, such an action might be warranted if not doing so would cause irreparable harm to a large portion of the community and Arbitrum by extension. In this extreme example, the belief in decentralization and community ownership would need to be weighed against the proportional impact of not acting.


I also view centralization through different frameworks dependent on the actors involved, and I believe the centralization of the Offchain Labs serves as a positively aligned balance to the decentralization of on-chain governance. For example, the inability to push emergency upgrades has been lethal in certain settings. I think the community, through a vote, can choose to display their trust in the team and delegate that privilege to them. This introduces centralization but mitigates an existential threat.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

Full Reimbursement

Once the initial vote passed it should have been executed. Another vote can always be raised to negate the last. Such actions would likely reduce the subsequent number of participants in each proceeding vote, further skewing the outcome. The initial vote itself should be enough to display the community’s will. Assuming the protocol is actually able to produce the necessary payout without endangering the future of the project, it should make users whole in order to restore confidence. Not  doing so can kill a project. If it is unable to reimburse the whole amount, the next best option is a split reimbursement where the protocol either uses a combination of cash and treasury assets or promissory tokens. Where the promissory tokens can represent some claim on future profits generated by the protocol. Given the initial vote, I don’t believe there would be any instances where it would be right not to reimburse users in some way or even attempt to do so. Creative solutions can be found.

NFT development on Arbitrum, tooling, Improving protocol decentralization.
I believe that in order to extract liquidity in a DAO, one must proceed carefully and deliberately, taking into account the risks and potential benefits. If the goal of a DAO is to maximize returns on one’s investments, then DAO participants can decide the most efficient way to extract liquidity, taking into account the current market situation of the investment pool. In addition, one should take into account accepted technical and legal regulatory norms in order to protect the interests of DAO participants and reduce the risks of losses.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Nothing
Let us consider this situation from several angles. First, we must clearly define the objectives of the project, which will be achieved in a highly centralized power approach. Then we should identify the key participants in the project who will make decisions. Processes should also be established to ensure transparency of the decisions made, including their logging and open communication.
Next, you should identify the areas where decentralized decisions can be used and what resources (people, finances, technology, etc.) will be needed to implement each decentralized area.

There must be a constant exchange of information and coordination between the decentralized and centralized groups. In order to achieve the goal of the project and use the resources as efficiently as possible.
This move will achieve a balance between centralization of power and the ability to achieve results, allowing project participants to make decisions based on their knowledge and experience.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a digital organization that operates based on smart contracts and runs on a blockchain. Its members can make decisions and manage the organization’s assets through a consensus mechanism.
I am not the biggest fan of liquidity mining, at least not directly from a DAO; I think that in the best of many cases the best is to apply to different protocols that kind of incentives, maybe like Optimism that brought diverse uses to its network incentivizing it in an indirect way in usability and ecosystem.

How aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?

We should be extremely aggressive in liquidity mining if we want to maximize our potential for growth and success as a DAO. Liquidity mining is a powerful tool for attracting liquidity and users to our decentralized protocol, and by taking an aggressive approach, we can gain a significant advantage over our competitors.

The goal of the DAO should be to become the dominant player in the market, and liquidity mining is one of the key strategies we can use to achieve that goal. By aggressively incentivizing liquidity providers with high yields, we can quickly build a large and active community of users and investors, which in turn will drive adoption and usage of our protocol.
Of course, there are risks associated with aggressive liquidity mining, such as impermanent loss and price volatility. However, by carefully designing our incentive structures and monitoring the market closely, we can minimize these risks and ensure that our aggressive approach is both sustainable and effective.
While it’s important to be aggressive in our liquidity mining strategies, we must also be proactive in mitigating the risks associated with such an approach. One of the main risks of liquidity mining is impermanent loss, which can significantly impact the value of our token and erode investor confidence.
To avoid this risk, we should consider implementing a range of solutive measures. For example, we could use a dynamic pricing mechanism that adjusts rewards based on the level of liquidity and trading activity in our protocol. This would help to ensure that rewards are always in line with the actual value being added by liquidity providers, minimizing the risk of impermanent loss.
Additionally, we could implement a range of risk management tools, such as stop-loss orders and hedging strategies, to protect our liquidity pools from sudden price fluctuations. This would help to ensure that our liquidity providers are not exposed to undue risk, and would help to maintain stability in our protocol over the long term.
Ultimately, the goal of the DAO should be to strike a balance between aggressive liquidity mining and risk mitigation. By being aggressive in our pursuit of liquidity and growth, but also proactive in managing the risks associated with this approach, we can build a strong and sustainable decentralized protocol that attracts liquidity and users over the long term.
In short, if we want to achieve our goal of dominating the market, we must be aggressive in our liquidity mining strategies and relentlessly pursue growth and success as a DAO.
Sample Voting Issue 1 :


Againts


Increase the number of seats on the allocation committee to include more members from the Uniswap community, rather than giving the majority of the seats to Flipside crypto. This would help to ensure that decisions are made in a more democratic and decentralized manner.



Include other analytics service providers in the proposal to foster competition and innovation. This would ensure that the program is not biased towards a single service provider and would allow for a more diverse range of perspectives and ideas.
Ensure that the Oversight committee has a fair representation of members from the Uniswap community, rather than giving the majority of seats to Flipside crypto. This would help to ensure that there is sufficient oversight and accountability for the program.
Provide more transparency in the allocation of UNI to bounties by publishing regular reports on the program’s progress and outcomes. This would help to build trust and confidence in the program and ensure that it is operating in a fair and equitable manner.


The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex issue that depends on the specific context and goals of the project or organization. In some cases, centralization of authority may be necessary to make quick decisions and take decisive actions, while in others, decentralization may be more appropriate to ensure a fair and democratic decision-making process.

In the case of Uniswap, which is built on the principles of decentralization and community governance, it is important to strike a balance between centralized authority and community involvement. While it may be tempting to give a single service provider control over the allocation of UNI to bounties to get things done quickly, this would go against the principles of decentralization and could lead to a concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals or groups.
o strike a balance between centralization and community involvement, it is important to ensure that decision-making processes are transparent, inclusive, and involve input from a broad range of stakeholders. This could involve the establishment of a diverse allocation committee and oversight committee that includes representatives from various sectors of the Uniswap community, as well as the publication of regular reports on the program’s progress and outcomes.
In summary, the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a delicate balance that needs to be carefully considered in the context of the specific project or organization. In the case of Uniswap, it is important to prioritize decentralization and community involvement while still ensuring that decisions are made efficiently and effectively.

3. Split Reimbursement:

Where affected receive some amount of compensation, but not the full amount lost. This approach could strike a balance between addressing the harm caused by the hack and avoiding the potential negative consequences of full reimbursement. However, determining the amount of compensation to be paid and the criteria for eligibility could be challenging, and it may still raise concerns about rewarding risky behavior.

However, it is worth noting that the decision to reimburse parties affected by an exploit is often a complex and contentious issue, as it can have significant financial, legal, and reputational implications for the organization. Some argue that reimbursement can help mitigate the damage caused by the exploit and restore trust in the affected parties, while others contend that it sets a precedent for rewarding irresponsible behavior and undermines the integrity of the system.

When making decisions, it is crucial to consider the trade-off between centralization and efficiency. Although centralization may enable quicker decision-making, it could result in power imbalances and discourage community involvement.

In my capacity as a delegate, I recognize the complexity of the Rari hack reimbursement matter and acknowledge that it requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. Despite my sympathies towards the individuals impacted by the hack, I believe that a thorough assessment of the potential advantages and disadvantages of reimbursement is essential.
In my opinion, the decision of whether or not to compensate affected parties should be based on several factors, such as the severity of the hack, its impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In cases where the hack has caused significant damage or resulted from a systemic issue in the platform, full compensation might be necessary. However, in other scenarios, it may not be feasible or suitable to provide complete reimbursement.
As a delegate, I am committed to ensuring that decisions regarding reimbursement for those affected by an exploit are made on a case-by-case basis and reflect the unique circumstances of each situation. I will advocate for equitable representation of all community members’ interests and transparent and responsible decision-making processes.

Improving Governance participation

The overall goal of a DAO is to enable a group of individuals to collectively govern and manage a decentralized network or organization. DAOs operate through smart contracts on a blockchain, allowing for transparent decision-making, trustless interactions, and autonomy from centralized entities.
The specific goals of a DAO will depend on the particular project or initiative it is designed to support. Some possible goals for a DAO could include:

Providing a platform for decentralized crowdfunding to support projects or ventures.
Enabling decentralized decision-making for the management of a community or organization.
Creating a decentralized platform for the exchange of goods and services.
Supporting the development and deployment of decentralized applications (dApps).
Creating a decentralized network for peer-to-peer communication or collaboration.

Ultimately, the goals of a DAO should align with the needs and interests of its members and the broader community it serves. Clear and transparent governance structures and decision-making processes are critical for ensuring that the DAO operates fairly and equitably and that the interests of all stakeholders are represented.

NFT development on Arbitrum

Mining liquidity in the short term can be a great solution. But in the long run, this can play a cruel joke.
After spending a huge amount of time in various chat rooms. Most people are not for technology, but for the pursuit of quick profits.
Aggressive liquidity mining is acceptable when the corresponding demand is created. The NFT segment is in my humble opinion a great option to bring the public to the network.
But the NFT community is very active. They will come as quickly as they will leave. So the next step would be to focus on:

Supporting Infrastructure
Improving Governance participation

Considering aggressive liquidity

I vote against
There should be something balancing on the opposite side of the scale (whether it will be the NFT or the expansion and improvement of infrastructure, etc.)
it just so happened in our world that the strongest / richest / smartest have more power. In our case, the number of tokens will play a decisive role. And there are many examples when whales made decisions that were beneficial for themselves, but absolutely failed decisions for the project, for the benefit of profit.
To solve this issue, a multiplier can help, which will increase the power of the vote. The amount of the Multiplier could depend on: Activity in the project, holding of tokens, involvement and awareness of the product.

Public Goods funding
Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO: I believe that the DAO should strike a balance between aggressive liquidity mining and long-term sustainability. The goal of the DAO should be to create an open, decentralized, and inclusive ecosystem that empowers its members to contribute to its growth and development, while also supporting public goods and infrastructure.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
How would you vote? Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal, if any? I would propose that the allocation committee and the Oversight committee be restructured to include representatives from multiple analytics service providers, ensuring a more balanced distribution of power and decision-making. This would help mitigate the centralization of authority and address concerns of favoritism.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done? I believe it is crucial to strike a balance between efficient decision-making and maintaining decentralization. A more inclusive and diverse committee structure will encourage healthy debate, minimize centralization of power, and ensure that various perspectives are taken into account. This can be achieved without sacrificing the ability to make timely and effective decisions.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation? Split Reimbursement
I believe that split reimbursement is a fair approach in this case. While it’s important to acknowledge the affected parties’ losses, full reimbursement may set a precedent that the DAO will always cover losses from hacks or exploits. A split reimbursement offers partial relief to the affected parties while emphasizing the importance of individual responsibility and due diligence.
In instances where the DAO or protocol itself has clear responsibility for the exploit due to negligence or oversight, a full reimbursement should be considered. On the other hand, if the exploit or hack occurred due to external factors or user error, a partial or no reimbursement may be more appropriate. Each case should be evaluated based on its specific circumstances and the extent of the DAO’s responsibility.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance Participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

Fund innovation and the public good using the Arbitrum tech
Distribute the governance power in the hands of stakeholders crucial to the ecosystem growth
Uphold Arbitrum’s ethos as an open-source, decentralized and censorship-resistant platform to scale Ethereum and foster borderless dApps for the next billion users

Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty


Against


To ensure fairness, an open tender should be put out so that any organization can apply it to ensure competitiveness and fairness. There should be no more than one seat per analytics vendor on the allocation committee, and at least two seats should be reserved for independent personnel. Additionally, Flipside should not have a seat on the oversight committee. Furthermore, to avoid relying on a single entity to safeguard the assets, a decentralized Uniswap v3 LP position management solution (e.g. Arrakis Finance) should be implemented.


To strike a balance between efficiency and decentralization in DAO governance, a top-down approach is necessary to distribute the decision-making power. This can be achieved through the following steps:



Establish special workforces in sectors that matter the most to the DAO.
Select subject matter experts to run the workforce within the limitations set by the DAO, including budget and individual allocation size.
Leave decisions on matters outside of the limitations to be decided at the DAO level, and provide the option for the DAO to replace the workforce leads if enough consensus is reached.

Sample Voting Issue 2 - FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement

Split Reimbursement

First and foremost, governance decisions are final unless new material information comes to light, in which case a new proposal can be made regarding the same decision
In an ideal world, full reimbursement is the gold standard whilst also allowing the protocol to continue running. However, the FEI RARI hack was so large that a full reimbursement essentially means that the project can’t continue. Given FEI RARI’s great product-market fit, I would suggest a split reimbursement to keep the project running and position it for potential hypergrowth in the next cycle to make victims more than whole.
The split reimbursement mechanism compensates users in part with liquid assets held in the protocol’s treasury and in part with vested governance or debt tokens. Additionally, the team’s allocated tokens should be locked up and only vested if certain milestones, such as making victims whole, are met. This solution keeps the operation running, motivates the team to keep building, and creates a vested interest for both the team and users in the project’s success. It potentially gives more upside to the users.",664

It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO


Supporting technical upgrades to the ecosystem
Incentivising reach, retention, and revenue of protocols within the ecosystem
Incentivising the building of tools, and educational resources for the ecosystem
Guiding decentralisation of the ecosystem

Liquidity mining should be kept to the bare minimum wherever possible to dissuade mercenary capital farming DAO tokens. Token emissions themselves should have positive effects much further than incentivising TVL on-chain, for instance by being directed primarily to grants for the building of tools and resources for the ecosystem. When token emissions are to be used for incentivising protocol usage, a framework should be created to ensure distributors of these emissions are building sustainable models around their own products to incentivise their reach (new users). The product offering itself should be capable of retaining that captured reach (user base) and generating its own revenue, allowing it to grow and prosper sustainably without relying on further emissions.

Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

How would you vote?


Against


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?



Separate the proposal into a solely Community-Analytics focused scenario and away from treasury/capital management (singular-focused proposals should be the standard);
Segment grant amounts into shorter time periods with set measurable objectives based on the Reach and Retention of the outputs;
One way to improve transparency, accountability, and alignment of goals would be the establishment of a public, crowd-sourced task board. Although undoubtedly imperfect initially, the distribution process can be iteratively improved over time.

For example:

Starting by requesting small tasks from multiple third parties to find those that are the best fit
Increasing size and discretionary freedom of use of funds after successful cases
Using a KPI-based distribution system to increase accountability, trust and promote an over-delivery culture

Crowdsourcing and assigning appropriate reward amounts for tasks which are aligned with the UNI objectives sourced from the community would be a great long term goal


How would you approach the tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?


We believe in centralisation until product-market fit is found, as long as the best authority is leading —for this example, I cannot comment on whether Uniswap properly explored all Analytics options in their selection of Flipside. This could also be achieved in a distributed way where multiple providers were given the initial opportunity and grants were accelerated based on expertise and competent outputs as time progressed.

Voting Issue 2 (Rari hack reimbursement)
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

Split Reimbursement

This is mainly on a case-by-case basis, but when the protocol has a large enough treasury to facilitate such a reimbursement, it should definitely be explored. However, a DAO must also ensure it can continue to operate after such a reimbursement. Other mechanisms such as escrowed or vested reimbursements can also be explored to limit damage to the DAO (these mechanisms work only as long as the DAO generates revenue).
Another route would be a debt token which can be freely traded on the market, where the team buys it back. This is a very transparent and market-oriented way to solve debt obligations.
Exploits are a huge issue for the industry and how DAOs react to them will imprint their reputation for years to come. Nonetheless, it should also be considered that multiple insurance avenues are available, and all users of smart contracts must consider the risks in the first place.

I am interested in Improving Governance participation and NFT development on Arbitrum.
The level of aggressiveness in liquidity mining should depend on the specific goals and risk tolerance of the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) involved. Liquidity mining is a strategy in which users provide liquidity to a decentralized exchange or liquidity pool in exchange for rewards, usually in the form of tokens.
If the goal of the DAO is to incentivize users to provide liquidity and increase the liquidity of a specific token or pool, then it may be appropriate to be more aggressive in liquidity mining. However, if the DAO is focused on long-term sustainability and stability, then a more conservative approach may be necessary.
Ultimately, the goal of a DAO is to achieve its mission and objectives, which can vary widely depending on the specific DAO. Some common goals of DAOs may include decentralized governance, community building, promoting open-source development, or creating a new decentralized financial system. It is important for the DAO to determine its goals and align its liquidity mining strategy with those goals.

The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex and nuanced issue. On the one hand, centralized authority can provide clear direction and streamline decision-making, making it easier to accomplish tasks quickly and efficiently. On the other hand, a highly centralized structure can lead to a lack of diversity in perspectives and decision-making, which may result in blind spots, groupthink, and a decreased ability to adapt to changing circumstances.

To approach this tradeoff, it is important to consider the specific context and goals of the organization or group in question. Some questions to consider might include:

What is the specific task or project at hand, and what are the potential risks and benefits of centralization versus decentralization in this context?
What are the values and priorities of the organization or group, and how do these values align with different approaches to authority and decision-making?
What is the level of trust and collaboration among members of the group, and how might this impact the effectiveness of a centralized or decentralized structure?

In general, it may be beneficial to aim for a balance between centralization and decentralization, rather than adopting an extreme approach in either direction. This might involve creating clear lines of authority and decision-making, while also allowing for input and feedback from a diverse range of stakeholders. Additionally, it may be helpful to periodically reassess the structure and approach to authority in light of changing circumstances and feedback from members of the group.

I suggest changing the allocation committee to 1/7 instead of the current 3/7. Having 3/7 as the maximum amount below a majority doesn’t make sense for a Data Analytics company that has introduced bounties.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex issue, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, several approaches could help strike a balance between the two.
One approach is delegating decision-making power to those closest to the task at hand. By empowering people to make decisions, they can act quickly and respond to changes in the business environment. This approach can help the organization stay nimble and responsive to the needs. However, it requires clear guidelines, expectations, and training and support to ensure that the delegated authority is used effectively.
Another approach is to establish a clear hierarchy of decision-making authority. By creating a structured decision-making process, the organization can ensure that the appropriate people at the appropriate level make decisions. This approach ensures consistency and alignment with the organization’s goals and values. However, it can also slow down decision-making and create bureaucracy, which can hinder agility.
Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the specific context and goals of the organization. It’s important to carefully consider the tradeoffs between centralization and decentralization of authority and assess the organization’s needs and culture to find the right balance.

Users should feel safe entrusting their funds to protocols. That’s why reimbursement is the right policy. Users are not to blame if protocol management missed something and there were exploits/backdoors.
However, reimbursing everyone will set a precedent: projects can be scammers and do their own hacks of their protocols. That’s why I think that most protocols should insure themselves to be able to cover costs, at least partially.
Also, there should be strict controls and security checks on smart contracts. With an audit, the protocol should be allowed to operate.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

In addition, Flipside should not have a seat on the oversight committee. In addition, a decentralized Uniswap v3 LP position management solution (e.g., Arrakis Finance) should be implemented to avoid relying on one organization to safeguard assets.
To strike a balance between efficiency and decentralization in DAO management, a top-down approach is needed to allocate decision-making authority. This can be achieved through the following steps:
Create ad hoc working groups in the sectors that matter most to the DAO.
Select subject matter experts to manage the workforce within the constraints set by the DAO, including budget and individual allocations.
Decide on issues beyond the limits at the DAO level, and allow the DAO to replace workforce managers if sufficient consensus is reached.
Sample Voting Question 2 - FEI RARI Hacking Reimbursement
Separate reimbursement.
First of all, management decisions are final, unless significant new information becomes available, in which case a new proposal can be made for the same decision.
In an ideal world, full reimbursement is the gold standard, allowing the protocol to continue. However, the FEI RARI hack was so extensive that a full refund essentially means that the project cannot continue. Given that FEI RARI is great for the market, I would suggest split reimbursement to support the project and position it for potential hypergrowth in the next cycle to make the victims more than full.

My stance on overall goals for the DAO:




No protocol, such as UniSwap, should gain a significant power/ control.
Any provider, such as flipside, shouldn’t gain more than 1 seat. This would provide us with a broad participation of many parties.
How would I vote:
1 - against
2 - amendments = fewer seats for one single party
3 - major changes need to be approved by at least 75%, whereas smaller changes require just a simple majority e.g 50%+1





Split reimbursement - I believe, if we reimburse 100% of exploited funds, it would lead to a less carefully behaviour. Due to that reason, I would vote for a 50% reimbursement.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:**
As Vitalik said large token holders (individual or a company) has too much influence on the vote. I think voting system should be like this:
Anyone with more than 5 ARB will be able to vote but it will has a impact of 1. Well whales could spread 100 ARB to thousands of wallets but it will cost them least $0.50 each transaction.
I think main usage for the ARB token should be to decentralize the rollup. As you can agree Arbitrum right now is somewhat centralized. I am not a tech person but as i have read Sequencer could be decentralized with token (by giving the person running an sequencer small ARB rewards). Overall giving everyone the power of being in the Arbitrum Security Council is cool.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would propose a similar vote with other parties.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
In my openion ,the ability to get things done matters more to early stage DAOs, as often times things get stuck in a loop of repetitive debates for a long time, while the immediate objectives and goals of the proposal take a back seat.
Ultimately, on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Whole situation seems very compilacted as it impacted both individual victims and DAO’s. I think giving individuals FEI and giving DAO’s DAI looks very unfair. There shouldnt be a split. Also I’m not a fan of giving small balance victims more and whales less. Everyone should get their payback equal.
In my openion ,the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
To approach this tradeoff, I would advocate for the following:
Implement a multi-signature approval system for critical decisions, involving a diverse group of stakeholders.
Encourage community involvement in the decision-making process through open forums, discussions, and voting.
Establish a rotating committee structure, where members from different backgrounds and expertise can contribute to various aspects of the DAO.

It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The concept of DAO is so fascinating and welcomed by people is because of its decentralization, transparency and democracy. Therefore, among all its qualities, the most fundamental goal of a DAO is to create a decentralized system where decision-making is vested in the hands of the community but not a centralized authority. This ensures that the governance of the DAO is democratic and transparent. Meanwhile, DAO is supposed to promote a strong sense of community, foster collaboration, and foster relationship-building. DAO members should be able to communicate and work together towards common goals to achieve success.
Sample Voting Issue 1:


For


I suggest reducing the proportion of Flipside’s seats on the Oversight committee, as it is a supervisory body and should have less influence from those being supervised.


Making trade-offs can be challenging, especially when weighing between the benefits and potential drawbacks of centralization.
Centralization can ensure consistency of strategic goals by aligning decision-making with overall objectives and implementing them in a more cost-effective and less time consuming way.
However, transparency, diversity and democracy are also important. So, to balance between the advantages and disadvantages of centralization of authority, there are several approaches we can use.
a. We can introduce a dual-class vote structure, in which the voting power is weighted differently between the Flipside’s vote and normal votes. Thus, Flipside’s vote won’t significantly affect the final results.
b. We could incorporate specific and measurable milestones into the process. The subsequent payments and specific amount could be based on how the milestones are achieved.
c. Installment payment could be another efficient method. We can split the token into several payments, so the voting power of Flipside will reduce gradually by time.


Sample Voting Issue 2
Split Reimbursement
First, to determine whether and how to reimburse the affected parties of a hack, the community should have a comprehensive analysis before making the final decision, which implies taking more factors, such as the hack’s severity, the scale of the hack, feasibility of reimbursement and community impact, the security issues behind the hack and etc, into consideration.
If the amount of loss, the security issues behind the hack or the community impact of the hack are very limited, then no reimbursement can be acceptable. In other cases, split reimbursement should be considered based on different users’ cases. For those users who have followed the good security best practices and have taken necessary measures when the hack happened, they should get the full reimbursement from the platform or at least a big partial amount of reimbursement. While for those users who have neither followed the platform’s security best practices nor taken necessary measures, they should get less reimbursement from the platform.
Because in general, it is important to educate the users to have certain safety awareness and understand what necessary measures should be taken when under attack since there is no 100% guarantee that there will never be hacked. Meanwhile, it is also important for the platform itself to examine its potential security risks regularly.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
The main purpose of DAO is primarily to help in the development of the project and joint decisions that need to be taken depending on the situation in the market. For decisions to be correct and decentralized in DAO, it is necessary to have a large number of participants, it will allow to make decisions based on the opinions of participants, as well as to distribute more softly the number of tokens.
Also one of the important goals should be to support projects developing Arbitrum ecosystem, because the more quality ecosystem there will be more users and this is the growth and development.
As for liquidity mining, I think it’s a path that can lead to very unfortunate consequences if used aggressively and I’m against it.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 783
Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Gaming development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Arbitrum DAO should focus on advancing mass adoption of web3 technologies and should encourage and fund projects/teams that make it easy to board the next wave of Web3 users
While focusing on supporting core areas like DEFI, NFTs & Gaming a key focus area should be to encourage and reward projects/teams that can make onboarding web2 users and developers to Arbitrum easier
Arbitrum DAO should provide sufficient liquidity across all key exchanges to ensure the price of ARB token is not prone to artificial manipulation. It is important for Arbitrum DAO to hold a sufficient share of liquidity pools to ensure that bad actors do not use this as a way to acquire large amounts of ARB tokens through Liquidity mining and manipulate the token price & DAO governance adversely.
But the DAO should also ensure its liquidity mining strategy is dynamic and does serves the below purposes

Makes it unviable for whales to use MEV tactics to gain undue advantage
Make it fruitful for community members to provide liquidity and be rewarded in the long term. This will reduce sell pressure and encourage community to participate positively in the growth of the ecosystem knowing that they will be rewarded for supporting longterm. The DAO can take a decision after formation of how to can be best implemented

**Sample Voting Issue 1(Uniswap + Flipside): **
I would vote against a proposal that puts too much power being granted to a single entity(Flipside).
I believe that those taking decisions on who should receive the grants and how those grants are implemented should be two different entities. In this case, a council elected by DAO/Community should be deciding on the criteria for grants and the applications received for grants.
For a speedy implemeentation, A third party organization can be used to implement the grants program but a oversight body comprising of body elected by DAO should review/monitor the implementation
Sample Voting Issue 2 (FEI RARI Hack Vote):
I believe there should be a split reimbursement of funds in case a Protocol gets hacked and consequently the users.entities using the protocol loose their funds. It is important for Web3 protocols to assure its users & investors that it values them
At the same time, the protocol in this case FEI should ensure that the reimbursements positively contribute positively towards the future of protocol and can be delivered in tranches.  I believe any Protocol operating in Web3 should always have a playbook handy to address situations like protocol hacks/exploits starting with first respons to long term solution. We are fortunate to be in the situation where we have witnessed many issues to be able to identify those that might adversely affect our DAO
Arbitrum DAO should formulate a proposal to mitigate possible exploits that can adversely affect the DAO/Network

Still, generally speaking, the primary goal of a DAO is to enable decentralized decision-making and collective ownership, where members can participate in decision-making processes and have a say in how the DAO operates.  Regarding liquidity mining, the aggressiveness of the strategy will depend on the DAO’s resources, objectives, and risk tolerance. Liquidity mining can be an effective way to incentivize users to provide liquidity to the DAO’s pools, but it also carries risks, such as impermanent loss and volatility.  Regarding the voting issue, if I were a member of the DAO, I would consider the potential risks and benefits of the proposal and vote accordingly. If I believed that the proposal would benefit the DAO and its users, I would vote for it. Still, if I had concerns about the centralization of power and the favoring of one service provider over others, I would vote against it or propose amendments to address these concerns.  Regarding amendments to the proposal, I would suggest reducing the amount of control given to Flipside and increasing the involvement of other analytics service providers. For example, instead of having Flipside control the allocation committee, the DAO could establish a more decentralized approach that involves multiple service providers.  Regarding the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, it’s essential to find a balance that ensures effective decision-making without compromising the DAO’s decentralized structure. One approach is to distribute decision-making power among multiple stakeholders and establish clear guidelines and processes for decision-making. Additionally, transparency and accountability are crucial to ensure that all members have a say in how the DAO operates.  13      namnv 4d Name  NamNV  Wallet Address or ENS  0xEB5513F156d5d896Fe8d1Ba9bfc850d0A38e7f95  What area are you most interested in contributing to?

Sample Voting Issue 1: As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands.

Sample Voting Issue 2: As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.

In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.

How aggressive should we be in liquidity mining?
In my opinion, we shouldn’t to an agressive way of liquidity mining, as they should focus on more important parts of the DAO. For revenue purposes, people can use apps such as GMX and others; the DAO isn’t here for that purpose.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 703
Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding were delicate, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.
Most important is a long enough voting time but also a proper announcement that the community is aware of it. Also, Flipside should never be able to receive 3 of 7 total seats, and it’s very bad for decentralization.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

**Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:**eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO? Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
First, the number one priority of the DAO should be to support Arbitrum and its ecosystem by enabling effective collective decision-making and coordination in a transparant manner, while also upholding stakeholders’ interest.
As such, to achieve this, we should thrive for a meritocratic, inclusive environment that does not discriminate against gender, sex or religion, but instead rewards excellence and skill. The DAO should also be representative of it’s community.
As a serial founder and a seasoned builder in the web3 space I think we should have a good mix of seasoned builders and web3 enthusiasts. I have represented web3 projects in numerous IRL conferences around the world and have a passion to bring people together to build awesome stuff.  Let there be no doubt that the mission of the DAO is to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem and accelerate adoption among the masses.
I am not inherently against liquidity mining as a concept, however, I do think it’s important to mitigate risk and avoid unnecessary risk. Any increase in risk should be met with scrutiny and long term stability should be a main driver in the decision making process.

To answer this question we must remind ourselves why Bitcoin was created in the first place. Centralization in TradFI has lead to an overrepresentation of a small group of stakeholders, while underrepresenting the masses. Central banks started printing massive amounts of money and used these funds to bail out the wealthy on the dime of tax payers.
In order to not fall in the same trap, any possibility for a reimbursement of a hack should be met with scrutiny. In case of the FEI RARI Hack we should look into what measures the lender had taken to prevent such a hack in the first place. The presence of practices such as a well defined bounty program, security audits, multi-sig wallets and fail safe mechanisms should be taken into account prior to even consider a (partial) reimbursement.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.

These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reinbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors.  A full reinbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will obviously be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionaly, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which although is also part of the wider ethereum ecosystem it could be considered a conflict of interest. Currently, I am being allocated ~ 1k OP. In addition to this, ParaSwap has also been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme recipients, and if necessary, the representative of ParaSwap could be a different DAO member if this is considered a major conflict of interest. Personally, I believe that the growth of any decentralised rollup on the Ethereum ecosystem is a net positive for everyone in the space, and I will do my best to lend my knowledge in bettering the entire space ",701

Full Reimbursement
Full reimbursement is necessary for the DeFi protocol to regain the trust of its users, and to make right for those users who lost money from the hack.
If the treasury does not have enough money to repay, they should consider minting more governance tokens to repay the affected users. This would be a ‘debt-to-equity’ process that would help to restore the faith of the impacted users in the protocol and allow the protocol to continue its operation, while ensuring affected users could share the future success of the protocol.
The world of crypto can often lack clear rules and regulations. This means that we should hold ourselves to higher moral standards and expectations, especially when it comes to being fair to users and holders. As a DeFi protocol that prides itself on its governance model, Rari has a responsibility to do right by those impacted by the hack.

SEEDLatam is a non-profit organization dedicated promotes and supports web3 communities in Latin America. We bring together educators, developers, researchers, artists, entrepreneurs, students, and enthusiasts who build and promote knowledge about Ethereum.
SEEDLatam’s goal is to raise the level of understanding about web3 in Latin America and empower future leaders.

Together with L2 en Español, a community dedicated to the study of scalability solutions in Ethereum (born out of DeFi para Principiantes and SEEDLatam), we have decided to carry out this delegate platform to actively participate in the governance of Arbitrum DAO. We’re truly committed to the future of Ethereum and Web3.
While Latin American developers and builders have always been key players in the crypto scene, our regional community’s participation in formal instances has not been as prominent as we would like. In SEEDLatam, we want to change that by being part of the governance to collaborate on the expansion and growth of the ecosystem.
As a delegate platform, SeedLatam wants to work with its communities to coordinate a credible representation of all those truly interested in the future of Web3 and Arbitrum from the perspective of our region. We understand and value Arbitrum’s stage of development, being one of the most mature EMV-compatible Layer 2s, as an opportunity to showcase its advantages as an example to follow compared to other L2s, and in contrast to the L1 release scheme pretending to fix the current challenges of the Ethereum ecosystem.
Scaling Ethereum should be our priority in our path toward mass adoption, and we are willing to do our part in removing any barriers that might prevent this from happening in our region

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Prompts to Answer:


How would you vote?
Against


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?


SEEDLatam would have voted against this proposal - here are some points to consider:

There was no contest for applicant providers to compete with Flipside Crypto and propose a counterproposal for DAO members to choose from multiple options.
Uniswap’s DAO was not structured so that different organizations (delegate platforms, communities, student groups, etc.) could fulfill a specific/administrative role within the DAO, such as the Core Units of MakerDAO.
Flipside Crypto abused the governance process mechanism to get the proposal approved.

As SEEDLatam, we would have proposed the creation of a council for the DAO to vote on its members and have them manage the treasury grants, with a renewal of their position after a certain amount of time.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

The dilemma between decentralization and efficiency will always be contentious, but it doesn’t mean you can’t have centralized structures within a decentralized entity. A DAO can have decentralized governance while still having centralized working groups/subDAOs/committees that report to the DAO to optimize decision-making. Centralization is naturally efficient, so it makes sense for a group that must make quick decisions on specific issues to opt for a centralized structure. In summary, centralization makes sense when facing a convex disposition and decentralization when facing a concave one.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Issue Overview:
FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

Full Reimbursement
No Reimbursement
Split Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.

We would opt for a split reimbursement - When addressing this issue we have to ponder between two key actors in a DAO, those supporting it materially (through their effort) and those supporting it financially (through their ivnestments/contributions). We believe that a split reimbursement would be the best way to satisfy both parties.
This might be subject to different factors, such as the severity of the exploit, ideally, a solution should prioritize affected members first, but shouldn’t go as far as liquidating the DAO’s funds - since this would not only damage the DAO itself but also risk other members trust in the protocol.
Therefore, in cases like FEI RARI, there should be adequate compensation to those affected - preferably through vesting - but at the same time ensure that the protocol remains sustainable. Something to consider with vesting is that it should be sufficiently balanced, in order to ensure that the team remains incentivized to carry on with their work and that it’s scheduled in a way that it doesn’t get too diluted/loses it’s value.
Apart from this and beyond what happened with Tribe, DAOs should have a predefined policy on how to proceed in the event of an exploit. This wouldn’t only add more predictability regarding what the next steps should be for victims, but it also ensures that in the event of an exploit, victims won’t really have to go through DAO bureaucracy to receive some sort of compensation (assuming they were entitled to it). If not, DAOs could also opt for a Code Deference clause on their charters/constitutions - but these could create friction with their communities.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
I, Cattin, and other members of SEEDLatam’s delegate platform collaborate with various protocols and projects, but we don’t see any conflicts of interest. We will disclose any that may arise in the future. SEEDLatam is currently participating as a delegate in the governance of Optimism and plans to expand it to other protocols. Therefore, we will do our best to ensure that the work done by these delegations does not conflict with the interests of Arbitrum DAO, ultimately prioritizing the well-being of the entire ecosystem.",710

I am most interested in contributing to DEFI Development, NFT Development, Supporting Infrastructure, Tooling & IRL Arbitrum community gatherings.
I think Arbitrum should be very aggressive in liquidity mining. Liquidity mining is essential to any DAO. The goal of the DAO should be not only to speed up the ETH blockchain & make a faster easier to use L2 solution, but also become very creative in the way Arbitrum is advertised and grown in community.
I would have voted against the UNISWAP proposal because decentralization should always be key. Amendments would be to open up voting long before the 11th hour so the entire DAO would know about the issues at hand. As far as trade off between centralization and authority and the ability to get things done, issues should be broken up into subsets and given the opportunity that more creativity and inginuity is brought into the space.
As far as the Rari hack goes, I think the reimbursement should have been passed because its the job of your security team to pen test everything before hand and check the code more than just a regular audit. Check everything in solidity and Also I think more devs should be brought into the project full stack to work and keep the project safe and moving smoothly. I currently am still teaching myself Java, C++(python), Linux, Solidity, VYPER, Rust, Move, Etc…",714

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Pushing liquidity mining too aggresively can encourage transient peaks in liquidity and damage to trust if these liquidity levels aren’t maintained. The DAOs primary goal should be to incentivise genuine use of the ecosystem by promoting the most promising apps building on it.

Decentralization needs to be front and centre.

Ultimately you need to decide which is more important to the longevity of the ecosystem. Excessive centralization will undoubtely result in quicker decision making but the sacrifice is too great.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Split Reimbursement. While many would argue no refurbishment is the correct option, you need to look at it from the perspective of trust. It is very hard to re-establish trust once it has been lost.

It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from.

If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

Gaming development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Arbitrum has been the most thriving blockchain regarding blockchain gaming. We’ve seen the entire Treasure ecosystem rise for over a year, and it’s only the beginning…
What’s the role of the DAO in the emergence of gaming on Arbitrum?
The overall gaming market has attracted a lot of attention from various blockchains for over a year. We’ve seen significant investment from other blockchains to attract big web2 gaming companies and names to their chains, thinking they could bring communities through this method.
I believe that Arbitrum could be the real game-changer. Through its DAO, projects can be incubated and supported to guide them to create the best product ever and indirectly lead to massive onboarding of traditional gamers. There are approximately 200 million PS4/PS5 and Xbox consoles sold to date. Imagine onboarding just 1% of those gamers on Arbitrum…
If I have the chance to join the DAO as a delegate, I would make sure to do everything I can to promote massive adoption of Arbitrum by web2 gamers.

In this case, as a DAO, there is not much we can do if this has been voted. However, we can learn from this experience, educate members of the DAO, and ensure that they understand their concerns and how being involved can positively impact their journey through Web3.
Delegating votes could also be an option as long as a cap is fixed to avoid any kind of majority pool of voting.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
1. Full Reimbursement
A hack is always a sensitive subject because one entity will always lose in the equation.
I believe that all participants in the Web3 space have to take responsibility for their actions. If there were any breach in a contract, it means that the contract was not audited well enough and put its users’ funds at risk.
To prevent that from happening, I would also propose a TIP for auditing every new smart contract deployed from the platform by a trustworthy actor in the ecosystem.

As a user of Arbitrum since day 1 (September 2021), I’ve been involved in many ways in the ecosystem. By being here since the beginning, I’ve been able to follow the rise of Arbitrum and observe every decision made by the leading team. That made me understand the complexity and the importance of making the right decisions to thrive among all the other blockchains.
Being professionally involved in the Arbitrum ecosystem doesn’t mean that my decision would be personally driven. I understand the challenges that a DAO can face and will be able to be impartial with my judgment.",720

Improving Governance participation


Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

Overall
I believe the best way for Arbitrum to maintain it’s lead in the L2 space is to collaborate with the other L2s as much as possible. This may seem counterintuitive, but this is a network effects game and the real market leaders are not Optimism and Starkware types, but Visa, JPMorgan and the Federal Reserve types. This is the big pie we are fighting for, and to get it we should be working together.
Also, we should be making every effort to be effective in our coordination and learn from the mistakes of other DAOs, and stay at the macro level for DAO wide governance decisions. If I end up with a large voice in this DAO I will be actively reviewing our Governance set up early one to avoid these mistakes.

Liquidity Mining?
In my opinion, aggressively pursuing liquidity mining may not be the best approach, but it’s crucial to bootstrap network effects. I recognized the importance of this early on when xDAI (now Gnosis Chain) and Polygon were the early popular EVM chains. Polygon put a lot of effort into business development and attracted a diverse range of organizations to their network by providing them with grants. On the other hand, xDai didn’t pursue that strategy, and we can see the outcomes.
As for Arbitrum, I believe it’s essential to aggressively engage all sectors of the market. Although Arbitrum has made significant strides in DeFi, other markets such as gaming, NFTs, and DAOs are still relatively underdeveloped on the platform compared to the rest of the industry. We should aggressively pursue these markets by employing token swaps, vested incentive programs, quadratic funding and milestone-based approaches. While I’m not particularly fond of liquidity mining, I believe that we should be open to using that (especially if the rewards are streamed to the user over longer periods of time) and there are also alternative approaches can help us attract strong strategic partners to the chain.

Sample Voting Issue 1: Uniswap & Flipside

How would you vote?
Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
If it were up to me, I would suggest starting with a smaller proposal before jumping into a $25 million defi play. It’s a lot of money to commit to a first-time experiment with a new partner, and we don’t want to risk so much so a partner can earn fees on defi and run a bounty program. Honestly the whole plan of putting UNI into Aave and borrowing ETH, while creative, was too risky.
To be honest, my preference is to use Quadratic Funding and Prop House for programs anyway as they are less centralized options. These methods offer a more democratic approach to funding and avoid concentrating power in a few hands.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I strongly believe that we shouldn’t have to choose between centralized control and community engagement when it comes to fund distribution. In my opinion, having a product person and centralized control is essential for developing products. However, when it comes to distributing grants, we should be leveraging centralized decision-making powers to design and implement processes that are interactive and engaging for the community while avoiding centralized points of failure.
Tools like Quadratic Funding and Prop House are already available and can help us distribute grants as a community to anyone who wants to participate and make the process more enjoyable. Additionally, emerging tools like Pairwise can further improve our options for community engagement. In my opinion, traditional yes/no voting, as Optimism was doing, is a waste of time. If that’s the alternative, I can understand why someone would opt for centralized grant approaches. However, I believe there are better options available to us.

Sample Voting Issue 2: FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Split Reimbursement
The situation was quite complicated. Joey and his team at FEI promised a full reimbursement to the users, and for me, it’s crucial that DAOs maintain their integrity above all else. However, I don’t think Joe should have made such a commitment right away, as it’s not his money to give, it’s the DAO’s. Nonetheless, because he made this promise, the DAO should try to fulfill it to the best of our ability.
In this industry, even though we’re creating trustless systems, trust becomes crucial when those systems fail. That’s why organizations like Coinbase reimburse their users after hacks because it’s vital for people to trust the brand and believe that their assets are safe. It may cost a lot of money in the short term, but it will pay off in the long run.
The community would need to understand the impact of a $80 million loss for the DAO and then determine how to support those who have lost their funds. In my opinion, if there’s enough capital in the system, a full reimbursement makes sense. If not, we could split the reimbursement among the affected users, perhaps around 5% to 10% of a hair cut. This would be reasonable, especially considering that some people made a profits from the protocol before the exploit. As the organization responsible for managing smart contract risk, it’s important to be accountable when things go wrong.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
I’m the Founder of several companies including Giveth, Dappnode, Common Stack, and General Magic. Additionally, I serve as a Steward on Gitcoin and ENS. One potential conflict is that I have close ties with Jordi Baylina from Polygon Hermez, and their zkEVM, as well as I am an important Steward for Optimism, both could be considered competitors. However, I view these connections as opportunities to strengthen the relationships among leaders in the scaling space. My approach is to bring everyone to the table and work together rather than pitting one against the other. I believe that we are not competing against eachother but cooperating in the fight against traditional financial systems and banks. That’s why Giveth hosted the #ScalingNOW Conference in 2018, and I want to continue that effort to help us recognize that we are all in this together.
As a Steward of Arbitrum, I will of course be committed to prioritizing Arbitrum’s interests over those of any other organizations. If there is a serious conflict of interest (eg Giveth request a grant to deploy on Arbitrum) I will abstain from voting. It’s my responsibility as a Steward, and I will fulfill it to the best of my ability. I’m impressed by what Arbitrum has accomplished. I’m a big fan and a friend of many in the community.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:
Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.
These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reinbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors. 10 A full reinbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will obviously be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).

A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reinbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors. 10 A full reinbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will obviously be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionaly, I’m happy with this ",734

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO
The specific goals of a DAO can vary depending on its purpose and the community it serves. Some DAOs are focused on creating decentralized finance (DeFi) products and services, while others are focused on social impact, gaming, or other areas. Ultimately, the goal of a DAO is to provide a platform for decentralized decision-making that aligns with the interests and values of its members.
In summary, the overall goals of a DAO are to provide a decentralized platform for decision-making and governance, and to serve the interests of its members by aligning with their values and goals.
However, liquidity mining can also be a risky activity as it involves providing liquidity in the form of cryptocurrencies, which can be subject to price volatility and other risks. The level of aggression in liquidity mining should be balanced with the overall risk management strategy of the DAO.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Against
No amendments, just cancel it altogether.
The solution is reputational avatars , which solves most if not all DAO participation and token-weight voting problems.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 827
Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.
Prompts to Answer:
How would you vote?
A: I would vote “Against” the proposal.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
A: I would want to make sure that Flipside didn’t have so much control over the decision making and distribution of the UNI.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
A: While I agree that Flipside should have some control there should be a decentralized consensus among the community on how much power they have. This should be discussed and negotiated regularly on a fixed schedule.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
A: I think that the situation depends on what was the cause of the hack and what is being done to resolve the hack. I feel like the community should be fair with its decision and everyone should take some responsibility. I think that would be the best decentralized answer.
I would choose: *Split Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
A:If the cause of the hack was something that could have been avoided if the community had made the proper decisions in advance then they should take some of the responsibility and not be fully reimbursed or everyone in the community should take their share of the responsibility. Receiving no reimbursement because of inaction will cause the community to finally take action. If the cause of the hack was not the fault of the community then I would agree with reimbursement but I do not understand the specifics of how or where the funds would come from to do something like that. Morally that would be my answer.

I am not the biggest fan of liquidity mining, at least not directly from a DAO; I think that in the best of many cases the best is to apply to different protocols that kind of incentives, maybe like Optimism that brought diverse uses to its network incentivizing it in an indirect way in usability and ecosystem.

Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO, if a small group centralizes power, the name DAO is only an aggregate.
Something that can help is to predefine in the beginning the creation of committees and delimit the members it should have at the expense of increasing diversity against personal interests.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is a bad reference to the DAOs, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree, but I feel that the committees or delegates fulfill that vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize the governance processes.

A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and also take into account their survival, therefore it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, by literally draining their funds I do not think they can pay.
That’s why I think the best thing to do, and depending on the case like FEI, is to return money to those affected and it’s better , maybe under a vesting system or the DAO can get down to work to look after the interests of its users.

Overall Goals for the DAO:
An $ARB HODLer myself, I will aim to maximize the value of our collective bags.
Having a position on governance is akin to sitting on the board of a publicly traded company. Any decision that I make will be in line with what I believe to be the best path forward for Arbitrum and provide the greatest chance of success for the chain.
Arbitrum is a long-term project: governance must align with this. An emphasis on decentralization and a bulletproof product must come above short-cuts and easy profits.
Personally, I was disappointed by the $ARB airdrop. The safe route chose by the Arbitrum Foundation failed to capitalize on the potential of the airdrop.
Fortunately, there is still room to correct these shortcomings!
 The DAO treasury will receive 42.8% of the $ARB distribution 
Simply yeeting these tokens into liquidity mining or gas fee reimbursements is a poor usage of the treasury.
Much like Optimism and Blur’s announcements of a second airdrop, there is room for governance to carefully craft an airdrop that places $ARB into the hands of long-term holders, while boosting chain usage and retaining users, as seen with Blur’s approach of announcing the airdrop prior to snapshot.
The goal of future $ARB airdrops should maximize the incentives to come to Arbitrum and aim place coins in the hands of Arbinaughts!
Sample Voting Issue 1:
My Vote: Against (Amendments Required)
Proposed Amendments: Flipside receives no seats on the oversight committee
Centralization Tradeoffs: Centralization is required for operational efficiency. Running every decision by the DAO is inefficient and would put Arbitrum behind the competition (not trying to recreate the Maker governance process here). Frameworks should explicitly outline where DAO consent is necessary. Regarding Flipside, I believe the allocation of 3 seats on the Allocation Committee makes sense: Flipside is being consulted as the expert and is trusted to distribute bounties. Oversight of any DAO program, however, should not be in the hands of those with direct monetary incentives to see the renewal of the program or may be more inclined to adopt lax oversight frameworks.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Best Solution: Full Reimbursement
Rationale: Protocols owe a fiduciary responsibility to their users. If a protocol is able to make its users whole after an exploit, it should. Failure to do anything less is selfish and completely undermines crypto values. $ARB holders have an equity-like stake in the network and should be the bottom dollar of the capital stack. Making users whole comes above all else, end of story.

Balance and perspective. Those are the key elements to take into consideration. Most people will be scared to see the protocol having too much power because of bad experiences they had with web2 companies, for instance. So, you need to understand their point of view. The same goes for them, it will never go exactly the way they want too and despite the fact that this way is the best way to handle things. It is still not perfect. From time to time, you will have to take the bull by the horns and for an important and quick decision, satisfy the most people possible, whatever that means and it will piss off people. Just gotta remind them that the best scenario for them isn’t the best for everyone. As a protocol, don’t be greedy, try to satisfy as many people as possible, don’t be egoistic and at ultimately, everything will be fine.

A: DeFi development on Arbitrum, Improving Governance
The overall goals of the DAO should be to set a clear vision and purpose, make a governance structure that is open and includes everyone, find a balance between liquidity mining and stability to attract new users, create a tokenomics model with aligned incentives for all stakeholders, and encourage long-term growth and scalability.

For
Restructure the allocation and oversight committees. Change the members of the allocation and oversight committees so that they are more representative of a wide range of people. This could include contributing members from the Arbitrum builder and the Users.
60% Ability to get things done 40% for centralization of authority. We need to find a balance between these two, also we can have a voting process under the governance structure and committees to let users and builders decide the committee members. I would say the composition will be committee(30%) > builders(15%)  >users(35%)> Third party overwatch Council(20%)

Q2

Support and encourage all the projects on Arbitrum for audit, if the project got hacked we need to find out the amount first and how many victims. For me, the best way is that the project keeps running, for the profit that they earn after they need to pay back to the victims, meanwhile the committee need to give the project support and guidance.
Split Reimbursement. After the project gets hacked the team of it needs to show their effort and proof of work so that they can get resources from the committee. But the most important thing is how they appease the users and don’t let them lose faith in this.
we can offer a bonus for the hackers or white hackers for finding the bug out of the contracts. And the treasury money will come from the project on the Arbitrum.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The overarching goals of Arbitrum DAO should direct Decentralized Governance (via $ARB) towards harnessing Network Effects – increasing the N.
EIP-4337 Account Abstraction facilitates the process.
The aim of Liquidity Mining should be defined before it is initiated; if not specifically, then at least generally. DeFi Summer 2020 and the ensuing bull market taught us many lessons about governance token issuance. An important insight that should be integrated and applied is this:

Majority of farmed governance tokens were dumped for ETH, WBTC, and Stable-coins. The market behavior essentially signaled an absence of governance utility for these tokens; consequently, the governance tokens did not retain or store value. I.e., Gresham’s Law manifested in real time as Liquidity Pools were drained of “good” money, driven out by “bad” money. The systematic dismantling of Curve Liquidity Pools that precipitated UST’s de-peg and, then, the ensuing LUNA fiasco is likely the most resounding manifestation of this monetary principle in recent history.

The goal of Distributed Ledger Technology is to decentralize emergent innovations to the masses. To quote Steve Jobs,

“We have to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.”

Arbitrum DAO’s greatest priority should be to create value and deliver it to the end users – We, the People.
Through Decentralized Governance, we should direct the DAO to onboard as many people as possible. Policies of Action must be chained with Consequences of Outcomes. This is how we harness Network Effects and hold ourselves accountable; this is how we decentralize the Ethereum Network. Nobody should even mistakenly refer to our Infinite Garden as a Centralized Network, nor ETH as a Security.
If elected as a Delegate, I will gladly share these ideas in further detail.
Decentralized Finance will be prioritized because we have yet to optimize it and leverage Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to its full potential. When parametrized appropriately, combination of DeFi with Public Goods can facilitate a Regenerative environment. We can say this with minimized uncertainty because the Great John Nash has already mathematically solved the Cooperative Bargaining problem; the satisfaction of these 4 axioms creates a Non-Zero Game, and generates Collective Non-Zero Sum Outcomes (Public Goods):
•	Scale Invariance
•	Pareto Efficiency
•	Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives
•	Symmetry
As a natural consequence of Pareto Efficiency optimization, Positive Externalities are likely to benefit some, many, and essentially all tags.
Initially, I’d like for us to focus on the following causes in order to ensure we help those people first who need it the most. Money makes the world go round.

This is of particular relevance in the midst of our ongoing banking crisis. Residency DAO is special to me.

More context below pertaining to Optimism & Base
Once we optimize the system to achieve these goals, perhaps we can consider onboarding each United State as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
Sample Voting Issue 1
Vote for or against?
For.
Hindsight is 20/20, so it’s easy to act as the armchair governor and state what could have been done differently. Importantly, we have to take risks lest we stifle innovation and progress altogether through paralysis by analysis.
What amendments would you make to the proposal, if any?
None, though moving forward I’d recommend adopting innovative primitives from Elastic Decentralized Finance. Inversion of Price Elastic Digital Assets into Supply Elastic Digital Assets unlocks the value proposition of Double-Token Debts.
How would you approach the trade-off between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Here, my approach is straightforward – let’s avoid reinventing the wheel. We can model the system(s) that have already optimized this. A prime example is the Nervous System. Within the Active Inference & Free Energy Principle framework, Information Entropy (Free Energy) is actively minimized by the Nervous System to accurately infer the future (minimize Prediction Errors).
Mechanistically, information (entropy) is perpetually entering the Nervous System and it is processed via distributed computing in parallel at the level of individual neurons, collectively at the level of function specific regions, and then integrally at the level of dynamic functional brain networks. This maps on to individual user wallets, DAOs, and a global web3 layer on Ethereum.

Therefore, I’d like to simultaneously have delegate power on Optimism, Base, and/or other Layer 2s/3s built on Ethereum. This need not necessarily entail a Conflict of Interest; rather, it can promote Checks & Balances.

More clarity here can be shared through media, but at this time my account is restricted in this regard.

Full Reimbursement. Debtors should be made whole, as they are the ones who delegated Trust in this case.
In such scenarios, a conceptual application of the Learned Hand Rule (Calculus of Negligence) can offer valuable pragmatic insights.
Roughly – if the Probability of Loss (P) x Gravity of the Loss (L) is greater than the Cost of Burden for the entrusted party (B; smart contract engineers, auditors, and associated entities):
P x B > L → then, full reimbursement should proceed.
Edit: P x L > B → then, full reimbursement should proceed.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?


•The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex issue that requires balancing competing concerns. On the one hand, a centralized authority structure can make decision-making more efficient and streamlined, enabling faster action and potentially reducing the potential for conflict or disagreement. On the other hand, centralization can also lead to a concentration of power and decision-making authority in the hands of a few individuals or groups, potentially limiting the input and participation of other stakeholders.

•When a hack occurs in a DAO, it is important to first take steps to mitigate the immediate damage and prevent further losses. This could involve identifying and fixing any vulnerabilities in the system, securing remaining assets, and investigating the extent of the hack.
Once the immediate situation has been addressed, it is important to assess the impact of the hack on members of the DAO and any potential repercussions for the organization as a whole. In the case of the FEI RARI hack, it seems that a significant number of members were affected.
It is important to ensure that the process is transparent and fair. This could involve establishing clear criteria for eligibility, setting a reasonable timeframe for claims, and providing a clear and accessible process for submitting and verifying claims.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
We think the No. 1 goal about the DAO should be growing the ecosystem, and having quality members that can sustain the growth of the DAO over any market conditions. As such, the DAO need both froth (publicity, general interest, eyeball) and anchor (great tech, math & finance flair, down to earth building). An atmosphere of solidarity is also important, where fellow members help each other and protect each other. This requires a basic level of trust, to maintain this trust, a committee should be elected to periodically review the up and coming members of the community, seed out bad players that plans to exploit the ecosystem for short term gain and connect the good members who can help each other out.
What is more important I feel is for the community members to build on top of each other rather than against each other. If the fellow members can build on top of each other, it’s like the leveraged effect, the ecosystem will grow exponentially, but building against each other will just result in stampede. There could be a DAO theater, where new comers will present themselves in front of the DAO members, if their product is 1. novel 2. high-quality 3. bring in fresh liquidity to Arbitrum, the DAO members  can tilt resources (eyeball, tvl, community) help to the new comer.

Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Against. We think too much decentralization will result in indecisiveness, but in this case, there is only one service provider here, which seems unfair. The allocation committee should have less concentration, and for any allocation initiatives, there should be at least 2 if not 3 contenders. There also should be a backtrack/amendment mechanism built in, as market changes very fast these days. In the case of unfit, or un-performance or members exploiting the allocations, the allocation committee should be able to revoke the allocation and be able to give it to someone else, following a pre-designed process.

Sample Voting Issue 2:

Split Reimbursement, and members should all contribute to a community insurance, if they would like to be reimbursed. furthermore, all participating members should have some threshold security requirement fulfilled, i.e. audit report by top auditor, well publicized bounty program, good development practice. The reimbursement from the insurance fund should be a time weighted, contribution weighted number.

The DAO should serve the long term health and security of the rollups, and should favor long term sustainability over short term gains. It should promote values like censorship resistance, decentralization, and security. The DAO should support Ethereum and other core infrastructure projects that Arbitrum depends on.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Against
The proposal gave too much centralized power to a small number of individuals.  I’d amend it to something like I describe in 3.
I’d start with a version that errs on the side of decentralization and give it a few months. If it proves too hard to get things done, have the DAO elect committees, compensate committee members to ensure proper attention, and hold them accountable to it through the constitution. The DAO would occasionally reelect these committees.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
My vote would depend on the source of funds for the reimbursement, and in any case I would only vote for partial reimbursement.
I would vote against any reimbursement paid by the public in any way. The protocol wasn’t sufficiently battle-tested, users knew this going in, since the protocol was moving faster than some other more conservative projects. Their losses shouldn’t be socialized.
I would vote for a partial reimbursement if it is paid by the protocol’s treasury or founders. It makes sense for the protocol stakeholders to show accountability and share the burden since they were in a position to secure it.
I would vote against reimbursement of anything over 80%, no matter who pays for it. We should not condition users to expect a bailout because it promotes carelessness. Users should learn to do their due diligence and prefer protocols that invest in security.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The overall goals for the DAO should be “efficient system”.
Regarding infrastructure, the powerful incentives drive operators to contribute to a stable system. Making a well-organized incentive structure is one of the most important role of the DAO.
However, purging really matters. Indolence, moral hazards, and negligence hamper the growth of ecosystem. DAO must take a holistic approach; use greed and punishment appropriately.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

How would you vote?
Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
This proposal tends to think of token allocation as a light thing. Respecting the ecosystem participants, allocating new tokens should be done cautiously. They could make one or more steps other than the proposed committee, such as a DAO vote.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I have watched a few blockchains in which the foundation grabs a powerful authority on the excuse of executive ability. This eventually led to corruption of the governance and betrayal of the ecosystem. Wrong things have been done by governance of few people: using bounties stealthily, giving authority to incapable parties as a personal favor, and selling tokens behind using a mixer.
As long as the DAO takes the principles of decentralization, we shouldn’t prioritize the ability to get things faster.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

Split Reimbursement
DAO has a responsibility to protect the ecosystem from an attack from outside. I think it is necessary to reimburse to protect the interests of ecosystem members. However, there should be pain and it must be shared.

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
I believe the role-back should be done when it is a situation of system fault. Mistakes made by a single party are not applicable.

Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I think that liquidity mining is second to protocol decentralization and stability. I think that developer friction and onboarding/offboarding is ALMOST as important as liquidity mining and thus I think that focusing on the technology, process, and people is likely the most important thing to be focusing on, and liquidity mining as a short second. I think the overall goal should be to foster innovation through proper vetting and delegation. The last thing needed is a poorly vetted proposal that begins to lopside the dao.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?

I would vote against.


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would likely likley amend this proposal to include a phase-in or deferred seat allocation. It doesn’t make sense to commit 3/7 seats for a bounty protocol without proper representation. I think that is likely what brings DAOs down is that these things float under the radar and then get contentious in the 11th hour because it wasn’t properly lobbied and then it was viewed as an over commitment without merit. Perception is key.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?


There lies the problem. The technology was probably properly there but the proper people and process were highly under implemented causing the wrong perception to be granted at the wrong time, which was too late in voting procedure. For DAOs to work, again  at the cost of sounding like a broken record, people - process - technology have to be instantiated to carry the voting procedures through. It can be done but it takes dedication tooling and more to ensure the proper questions are represented up-front to not create noise later.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Issue Overview:
FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
no reimbursement but maybe a delayed reimbursement or split reimbursement
I suppose a split reimbursement is likely a good option. Here is reality though. This is going to happen without proper tooling and technology. I would be willing to vote delayed and/or split if it was proven, without reasonable doubt, that this was due to negligence of the technology implementation. If it was proven, through audit, to be beyond negligence, meaning an exploit occurred through some other means beyond human understanding (some under appreciated vulnerability) then I would vote NO as there is only the extent of human understanding. Again…a certified audit would be able to share how the exploit occurred.

Improving Governance participation

Governance participation continues to plague a majority of DAOs. With our experience across many top DeFi and layer 2 DAOs, we will place a focus on increasing governance participation through delegation and education.




Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

StableLab is the leader in professional delegation and governance framework design. We strive to help DAO decentralize sustainably.
We work in numerous DAOs where we author proposals to implement frameworks that help DAO decentralize safely. You can check out our authored proposals here.




Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO:
Our goal for the Arbitrum DAO is for it to decentralize safely and sustainably. Our systematic framework for DAOs covers governance methodologies, decentralized workforce, implementation, documentation, communication, and community engagement. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, but we provide a framework of principles and tools we have developed throughout our experience. We hope to help Arbitrum implement strong governance frameworks to increase participation as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of the DAO.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
1. How would you vote?

Against

2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?


Adjust the allocation committee to be comprised of more neutral parties. Additionally, this committee should be voted on with strict term limits and responsibilities to make the process fairer and less centralized.


Clear KPIs. Having vague transparency dashboards and committees does not make it clear if the program is succeeding or not. Instead, it is better to have concrete KPIs so the community can easily tell how the program is performing


Break this proposal into multiple smaller proposals.

Including who sits on the committees
A grant proposal for Community-Enabled Analytics for Flipside
How treasury funds will be managed
Putting this all in one proposal makes things confusing for voters and mixes some positive aspects of the proposal with negative ones.



3. How would you approach the tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Decentralization should be thought of as a journey and not a sudden switch. Being completely decentralized from the start is not feasible as it can be a slow and inefficient way of making decisions. However, through the implementation of strong governance frameworks, the decentralization process can be made more efficient. It takes time to implement frameworks such as proposal timelines, working groups, and automatic proposal implementations. With these frameworks and a strong governance system in place, a decentralized protocol can get things done similar to centralized organizations but with the transparency and trustlessness that decentralization offers.
While we believe that protocol should work towards decentralization it is important to do it sustainably to ensure that the protocol remains efficient and can’t be taken advantage of. We look forward to helping Arbitrum DAO on its decentralization journey.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
Vote: Full Reimbursement
Rationale: Reimbursement after a hack is a difficult subject and should be looked at on a case-by-case basis. Some things to be considered when deciding on whether to distribute reimbursement are was the hack easily preventable, who would bare the brunt of the cost of reimbursement, would reimbursement cause the protocol to go under, does the protocol plan to continue operating after the hack, how large is the DAO treasury, is there any other way to go about reimbursement such as revenue split to eventually pay back those affected.
In the first snapshot proposal, not enough of these questions were answered. This can lead to uninformed decision making which can be dangerous for a DAO. As Rari eventually deprecated their governance and protocol it makes sense for any existing money to be used to make those affected whole. However, this must be done very carefully you must consider in what order and in what asset you will pay people back. Additionally, if the funds available cannot cover all affected will you make some users whole, spread the money evenly, or spread it proportionally.
In situations like this, it is very important to consider all options and be transparent with information. This helps voters understand the situation and cast an educated vote which is more likely to lead to a beneficial outcome.

Liquidity mining has proven to be a workable strategy to incentivizing liquidity providers and community contributors to DAO ecosystems. As much as liquidity mining enhances rapid growth of a DAO, the risk tolerance of the DAO is to be considered. This rightly relies on the goal of the DAO …in this case, Arbitrum. Security of funds is key as well as transparent governance protocol and modality.

This is because delegation of voting power has become an amazing part of DAO’s in so far as wielding of so much power or centralization isn’t affecting the goals and guidelines of the ecosystem


Nothing more at the moment


There should be a balance. This is because, things has to really be done for the good and advancement of the DAO and ecosystem. Some level of centralization may be observed, meanwhile not at the detriment of the need for getting things done.


Sample Voting Issue 2
I would settle for split reimbursement. Given the transparency that should exist in a DAO, a hack is a loss for the organization and the community at large. (Provided that error codes in the contract isn’t a fault from the organization)
In a split and vesting format, those affected could be reimbursed. Lack of funds could be the reason for the flipping of the votes. As such care should be taken not to cripple the ecosystem completely in view of a mandatory full reimbursement. I think split gradual reimbursement would ba a better way to go at least the much advocated mass adoption would be achievable. Hacks could create apathy and distrust for the decentralized ecosystem. As such in a split and vesting manner the affected individuals could still be happy with the DAO.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Liquidity mining is a necessary element of web3 however one always has to assess the
The goal of our DAO is to increase arbitrum governance participation with the help of NFTs and an aggressive liquidity mining strategy early on that would later be evaluated as the protocol grows. We believe it is important to offer competitive yield compared to other popular protocols to be able to increase the TVL in the protocol. It is however important that this is done with risk-assessment as it should not be aggressive enough that it could harm or hinder the chains growth. It is also important to balance this correctly as to let an organic growth and grass root of communities, DAOs, projects etc to appear.
The plan for our DAO is to make it easy and simple for users of other protocols to participate in arbitrum while at the same time be profitable for our community as we grow together with arbitrum. This will be done through our NFTs and staking with community rewards for governance participation. I believe with the help of an airdrop allocation we can build this and grow organically and maximize the value of the $ARB for the future of the protocol and communities it will give life to.

It is a very hard but important task to keep at mind and the only purpose of web3 to ensure decentralization of applications however we are currently in the building stages of this new decentralized network and will have to make centralized decisions for the sake of a decentralized future. Centralized decisions should only ever be accepted if they are taken as a last measure and only for the sake of the future of decentralization. This is very hard to balance and work out however I believe that we have to delegate some authority in good faith until its not longer technically needed.

There should be no standard practice of refunds in web3/defi. This is a new space and everyone is taking risks while building and creating and the same goes for users who are trying to profit off the protocols. Web3 projects/companies are free to offer refunds if they wish to but it is definitely not the duty of the protocol and is standard ToS at any decent web3 application.

Public Goods funding
Improving Governance participation
Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

I fully truly honestly believe in decentralization. Everywhere in DeFi and in crypto. Crypto is phenomenal in that it leaves governance and steering aspects to the group of stakeholders, without any authority getting involved. It allows individuals to realize their visions and produce wealth generating apps, service providing projects, and life-changing/saving protocols - such as the Arbitrum eco-system.
However, financial independence and life improving apps are only for a few chosen ones - how many are currently invested in crypto? Under 1 % of the world’s population? To make the rich richer is not what I’m interested in. Quite the contrary. I see a great advantage in the use of crypto for the underprivileged ones, be that in my own country, Germany, as well as in developing and poorer countries around the world. Crypto as a means of payment throughout Africa would help solve many problems. I do believe it is this absolutely mandatory to give back to the community once you receive an abundance of things, in terms of finances, knowledge, or services. Help the needy ones to help themselves, is what I believe. This revelation came to me after a 2-year-long stage in Africa with residencies in Kenya and Cameroon.
I believe sharing is caring.
I equally believe reaching out to the brilliant minds that support crypto and the Arbitrum eco-system already is what could speed up things in above mentioned areas. Hence I fully support a Governance system comprised of socially-minded individuals, who simultaneously are equipped with a great mind for finances and the future of the world (no less). This system would be set up to improve communication, development of services, development of the platform and the onboarded projects and facilitate sharing of assets and services to the public, as well as crisis management, should such. crisis arise.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

How would you vote?
Against

As a future delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal in its actual state. Yes, I think a project like Uniswap may choose bounties and other ideas to attract new users to the platform at their own free will. And Flipside, as a data analyst company, which gives back to the community by offering cost-free data - I use those services myself, might have been an appropriate partner. And I feel much cares has been placed on the fairness of the deal for both sides, including transparency, openess, community involvement, and! I honestly believe I would have reached the intended goals:
‘Flipside’s value proposition begins with analytics, but its true purpose is to drive ecosystem acquisition and retention.’
But at what price?
With Flipside onboard it feels like giving Alphabet/Google or worse: Facebook/Meta the opportunity to support your project: you never know, who they drag along, and what they plan on doing with your data - selling it would be just one of my worries.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Hence, I believe the planned partnership with Flipside would have led away from decentralization and toward a much more centralized structure and came dangerously close to giving controlling powers to one single entity. And the ensuing fight for the few seats made it very obvious what direction the proposal was about to take, benefitting already privileged ones, the Flipside stakeholders.

As a delegate I would make sure to change the proposal so that more than one partner joined.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

To protect the Arbitrum eco-system’s decentralization and independence constitutes the highest goal for me. Hence I would each give them one seat (5 for Uniswap) and I would allocate where a certain percentage of the funds had to go to. I would herewith strengthen the independence and decentralization of Uniswap.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
The FEI RARI Hack incident made me cringe. We have all been involved in exploits, hacks, and rug pulls, hence my sentiment after hearing about this was hack was: those poor souls. So much many that was invested to secure someone’s pension or livelihood, all those hard-earned tokens that were stolen, I felt for the victims.
And yes, my first reaction was, hopefully they were getting reimbursed. I remembered the last exploit I was involved in, where the criminal Devs, who stole the money, simply disappeared. It was a feeling of anger and desperation.
Generally, I lean toward full reimbursement in most cases.
Having said that as a delegate, I would look at such an terrible situation very carefully. Yes, there should be reimbursement payed out to investors. But how much would depend on the overall situation.

Full Reimbursement
In this case I would have supported full reimbursement. It is technically and financially feasible. Plus, it was the responsibility of the protocol owners to repair a known security issue:

Quote from the Block.co: “The incident involved a common issue known as a reentrancy bug, a smart contract vulnerability that enables hackers to make repeated calls to a protocol in order to steal assets. Just a few weeks ago, two DeFi protocols on Gnosis Chain – Hundred Finance and Agave – lost customer funds amounting to more than $11 million in flash loan attacks resulting from reentrancy bugs.”

I would support Arbitrum 100%. I am not involved in any other project as a delegate, my mind is totally free of a conflict of interest. I would be exclusively responsible to Arbitrum’s community and its best interest. It would make me very proud to serve Arbitrum and its community. I’m a freelance artist, so there will be ample time to do so.

Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
My focus will be on bringing as many tools in a permissionless and decentralized way, for as many as possible for financial access.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

DAO’s need to have voting independent in a token economy and vote as 1 address = 1 vote, however, address eligibility in voting should be weighted by activity on the protocol. Token liquidity should be incentivized mainly for long-term liquidity providers. Points-based activity for those who keep providing liquidity for a certain time. 1 month = 1 point, 2 months = 2.2 points. early liquidity providers should be rewarded.

[Issue Overview ](app. uniswap. org/#/vote/1/2)

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would make one simple amendment, give Flipside 2/7 seats on the allocation committee, requiring them to prove bounty allocation through merit rather than focusing on convincing 1 vote for majority.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
As I’ve mentioned previously, I believe in progressive decentralization for many reasons. One is upgradability, we are building the world’s most revolutionary technology. We’ve seen too many DAOs stifled early on by utopias of full decentralization that didn’t account for a rapidly growing technology platform & user base.

There are ways to enable councils for different responsibilities that can make decisions on behalf of token holders which is why delegation has existed and pre-dates even Greece!
The DAO voting system is an evolving system in itself and should have the proper avenue to upgrade its own voting system to further progress its mission.

If I’m understanding correctly the first vote passed, presuming some discussion took place around the details of the hack and why people felt they should be reimbursed.
The next vote in May 2022 was a different instance with its own circumstances. I will have to presume that the discussions brought forward precedence of the previous April 2022 vote. Whatever the reasons were it seems to have been rejected. Unless there were issues of manipulation of voting, every vote should be final until the next vote is brought to light. Otherwise, the very purpose of a resolution will not be taken seriously, jeopardizing the entire voting system itself.

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a new kind of organizational structure built with blockchain technology that is often described as a sort of crypto co-operation. It is a way of organizing people and their interests on the internet using the blockchain. A DAO must ensure security is prioritized, as exploits can leave a DAO drained of millions of dollars of its treasury savings.
The goals of a DAO is to be generally focused on creating a decentralized, transparent, and democratic organization that is not controlled by any central authority.
Liquidity mining should be adopted in a way which is sustainable to the growth of ecosystem. Hyper liquidity mining can destroy the ecosystem.

How would you vote?
I will vote against the proposal. As at that time crypto was in nascent stage and defi dexes was unheard of. To fuel growth in positive way, it was need of hour.

Cryto is born to bring down the centralization, centralization should be avoided but the people with large amount of money can take larger vote share by owning higher number of tokens. So, it can not be undone.

Supporting Infrastructure


Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization


Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The goal of the DAO is to maximize protocol growth, while minimizing decreases in decentralization (in my opinion, this is more important then growth). This involves reading, understanding and voting on AIPs proposed to or by Arbitrum, aswell as enforcing standards for said AIPs. The DAO should be impartial, as much as it can be being staffed by humans. If the community signals support for AIPs, delegates should trend toward the overall consensus for smaller issues, while drawing hard lines in the sand in matters of decentralization.
Arbitrums future success depends on it being neutral, secure and as decentralized as possible. Liquidity incentives are less important for a pure governance token like $ARB (opinion) then getting the token into the hands of as many people interested in contributing as possible. Provide enough liquidity to make the token easily accessible to all who want to join in the governance process, and prevent huge spikes in either direction in price.
Sample Issue 1: Uniswap Flipside committee centralization issue
If I were voting on this today, I would vote “for”, with amendments. 3/7 committee members for fund allocation is high - it only requires convincing (or bribing?) 1 extra member to move forward. I would try and amend this to 2 seats. If Flipside wants to allocate funds a specific way, they should be made to have an argument for it at least convincing enough to get 2 more votes.
I approach the “getting things done” aspect with the goal being to be the most trusted of the secondary baselayers of Ethereum. In this particular case, I think since Flipside is doing most of the work in this proposal, with the express purpose of driving traffic and tooling to Uniswap… Its pretty much all upside for Uniswap if they succeed, with very little downside if they fail. They should have an easier time making changes because of this, but I still think amending to 2 votes required from other council members is enough to require them to justify their choice with a thought out proposal, but not enough to provide excessive friction in moving forward.
Sample Issue 2: RARI exploit and repayment votes
This is a tough one, but in the end I would have voted for Full Reimbursement. This seems to have been RARI’s contracts that were at fault, they even had previous hacks that should have prompted a stronger review of their codebase. The users of the protocol were innocent in this, and they rightfully put it to a vote. The community decided to reimburse users, and RARI paid for their mistake out of pocket.
In events like this, context is important. Say for Arbitrum, if a layer 3 spins up their own chain on Arbitrums layer 2 and that chain gets exploited because of poor security and audits of the codebase on that chain… there should be no reimbursement from Arbitrum itself for the affected users. If Arbitrums code is the reason for the draining of a child chain, or the bridge were to be drained etc… I am of the mind user reimbursement will go further towards restoring the core value of the protocol (trust), then protecting the treasury in specific s\circumstances. Funds can be recovered, users often cannot.

This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.",808

Arbitrum DAO Goals:
We believe the goals of Arbitrum DAO are to:

Give the people who use Arbitrum a voice in how it operates and progresses to the future by allowing anyone to formulate an idea and effect change with that idea via governance.
Incentivize participation in the Ecosystem in a sustainable way. This does not mean basic liquidity mining so that yield farmers can profit, we would advocate for special ways to incentivize use of the network such as specially placed grants to projects so they themselves can incentivize use and especially to new builders joining the network. We must think long term here.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
How would you vote?
Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Though Flipside might not have a majority of voting power on these committees they have a large minority and could affect change how they see fit by swaying a small portion of remaining votes to their side. A Possible amendment would be to lessen their seats on the allocation committee and increase the amount of seats on the oversight committee to a total of 5 allowing Flipside to keep their 1 seat.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
A DAO must be effective in its operations and functionality but the name also stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, giving any one person or entity too much say at the expense of effectiveness jeopardizes the very essence of its existence which is to give all users a say in how things are done.

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning) Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
Full Reimbursement, the DAO voted to ratify this reimbursement and should not have the ability to go back on its word unless there are clearly defined measures in the original proposal that would make it null and void should those measures take effect or if the original vote called for a second vote.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The overall goals of the DAO should include decentralization, transparency, community building, innovation, and adoption. All of these goals create a decentralized Arbitrum that is controlled by the community and allows for collaboration in a transparent way. If decentralization, transparency, and community building is achieved, the DAO can promote adoption and innovation of Arbitrum.

Specification of details on how the success of the program would be measured/evaluated.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I approach this tradeoff depending on the specific context and goals of the subject in question. A situation which requires rapid coordinated action may require centralization of authority. In dynamic and uncertain situations, decentralization is more appropriate. Ultimately, a balanced approach which leverages the benefits and mitigates the risk of both of centralization and decentralization is best.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Full Reimbursement. All parties should be fully imbursed. While the argument could be made that full reimbursement would cripple the protocol and encourage users to engage in risky behavior without taking necessary precautions; making parties whole is the appropriate response in this situation.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.

These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reinbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors.  A full reinbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will obviously be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionaly, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which although is also part of the wider ethereum ecosystem it could be considered a conflict of interest. Currently, I am being allocated ~ 1k OP. In addition to this, ParaSwap has also been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme recipients, and if necessary, the representative of ParaSwap could be a different DAO member if this is considered a major conflict of interest. Personally, I believe that the growth of any decentralised rollup on the Ethereum ecosystem is a net positive for everyone in the space, and I will do my best to lend my knowledge in bettering the entire space ",817

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem

Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO:
The goal of the DAO is to enhance the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem including applications built on top of Arbitrum and the expansion of its L3 net with its possibilities for specific chains. Decisions should be made while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the DAO and the overall health of the Ethereum ecosystem.
When applying these ideals to the concept of “liquidity mining” we can reasonably conclude that liquidity mining is a good way to attract attention in the short term but should not be seen as a long-term solution.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

How would you vote?

Against.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Allocate the grant quarterly or at least biannually with an established SLI/SLO. Given the size of the protocol and the work being done, there is no reason to provide the funds on a yearly basis. While we don’t disagree with part of the bounty being used to pay for Flipside’s operating costs we disagree with the delivery mechanism. Using a yield strategy to fund it brings a lot of unnecessary risks, even if minimal.
Ideally, this should also be done through an open tender procedure.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

This problem has generally been solved via representative democracy. It is quite understandable that not every single individual can take the time or energy to deliberate on every issue. A delegated committee or council largely solves this issue.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation? i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not?
Full Reimbursement
The only logical path should be to reimburse the affected parties. Whenever an exploit occurs the trust placed in that dAPP/protocol is gone. Reimbursing those affected is a large step in gaining back that trust.
If a DAO has enough capital to continue to operate at the cost of not reimbursing the affected parties their days are numbered and it will not do so for long at which point it’s simply better to reimburse those affected.

3.Finding the right balance between centralized control and effective operations is a pervasive issue for all types of organizations, including DAOs. On the positive side, centralizing decision-making authority can yield streamlined leadership and more efficient deployment of resources, resulting in speedy execution. However, excessive centralization can impede creativity, restrict engagement, and generate decisions that do not align with the interests and requirements of the broader community.

NFT development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
It is a bad reference to the DAOs, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree, but I feel that the committees or delegates fulfill that vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize the governance processes.
Liquidity mining,  ; I think that in the best of many cases the best is to apply to different protocols that kind of incentives, maybe like Optimism that brought diverse uses to its network incentivizing it in an indirect way in usability and ecosystem.
1.How would you vote?
= For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.


No proposal more


Much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision-making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of the wider community


Sample Voting Issue 2:
It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:


How would you vote?
Against


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Since the issue with this proposal is regarding the centralization of power, I would propose we engage more third parties to get involved in this redistribution hereby making it more objective. My rationale is that if there are ways to make it better we should, especially on a case like this.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
There is a time where centralization of authority is important since it impacts ability to get things done, especially in a case of emergency when time of response is critical. This is why I love the idea of Arbitrum security councel.

3. Split Reimbursement
I believe there shouldn’t be a blanket check where parties are always reimbursed for hacks. Participants also need to hold themselves accountable and learn how to follow best practices against hacks. I understand there are circumstances beyond people’s capacity sometimes so after through investigations, we can determine who is eligible for re imbursement or not.
We should also learn to asses who we put in critical positions to ensure security of DAO treasuries, multisig and infrastructures.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I believe that the Arbitrum DAO should focus on increasing decentralization and ecosystem growth both in terms of the community outreach and the number of projects.
The proposals and decisions within the DAO governance should benefit the ecosystem and provide ideas for a long-term and sustainable development.
There should also be incentives in the form of grants for the builders and community in order to increase the competitiveness of the rollup and attract more users and developers amidst the growing number of potential competitors.
One more goal could be becoming a common infrastructure for other chains (the Internet of Rollups) that are fast, secure, and low-gas.
Sample Voting Issue 1:


My vote would be: Against


I would increased decentralization by inviting other qualified members to the Allocation and Oversight Committees. After that I would support the proposal.


My view is that people in most cases can eventually come to a compromise after some discussions. Although this approach might be not so efficient in terms of time, but I strongly believe that this is the only way forward to the true decentralization. Any concentration of power or authority can, and most likely, will be abused.


Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
I would consider several factors first before making any choice:


How significant the hack was for the project and the ecosystem. If the amount was too big then it could damage the reputation and liquidity of the whole ecosystem. Even if the affected users receive full reimbursement, it is unlikely that many of them will trust the project again. This can lead to significant liquidity outflow and possible ecosystem downfall (depending on the size). Conversely, if the amount was relatively small then it makes full sense to even fully reimburse the losses (maybe with some vesting period) improving the ecosystem reputation and keeping some affected users in.


Source of reimbursement. We should carefully consider where the liquidity for the reimbursement comes from. Will any other project be affected by the decreased liquidity or treasury funds?


Can we explore other means to recovering the hacked funds such as an offer of a share of funds and no prosecution to the hacker in exchange for a return, or a bounty for the information that can help recover the theft?


Hacks happen regularly, and became even more frequent recently. This is an unavoidable reality of the digital world. That said, responsible projects and communities should be involved and help to resolve these critical accidents in order to maintain the trust and reputation of the ecosystem.
To summarize, In an average case I would be more inclined to support a partial reimbursement, but my choice will fully depend on an individual case details.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO. As a delegate, I would work tirelessly to ensure that the community’s interests are represented and that the DAO continues to thrive and grow over the long term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the Rari hack reimbursement situation is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Overall, the goals of a DAO should be aligned with the values of the broader blockchain community, including decentralization, transparency, autonomy, innovation, and social impact. By prioritizing these values, a DAO can create a truly decentralized and autonomous organization that serves the needs of its members and the broader community. When deciding how aggressive to be in liquidity mining, it is important to consider the potential risks and rewards, as well as the current market conditions. In volatile market conditions, it may be prudent to be less aggressive in liquidity mining to minimize risk of impermanent loss, therefore a less aggressive approach to liquidity mining is what I would convey for the long term benefit of Arbitrum especially as TVL and daily transactions are very high due to the utility and value provided by the Arbitrum ecosystem in comparison to other layer 2 solutions.

However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favour of one service provider.
Prompts to Answer:
How would you vote?
I would vote against because the proposal to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties was contentious due to concerns about Flipside having too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program. The proposal also seemed to favour one service provider over others, which raised further concerns. It’s important for any proposal to consider all stakeholders’ perspectives and avoid centralization of power to ensure transparency and fairness.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
It is important to have a more decentralized allocation and oversight committee. One way to achieve this could be to increase the number of seats on the committee and to have a more diverse group of members. Flipside should provide regular reports on the distribution of tokens to bounties and the performance of those bounties. This will ensure that the community has visibility into how the program is functioning and how tokens are being allocated. The allocation and oversight committee should be independent from Flipside. This could be achieved by having the committee appointed by a neutral third-party, such as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). To promote innovation and creativity in the bounties program, it is important to allow for the participation of other analytics service providers. This will encourage competition and drive innovation, ultimately benefiting the Uniswap ecosystem as a whole. To ensure that the bounties program has a positive social impact, it could be tied to social and environmental causes. For example, bounties could be offered for projects that promote sustainability or contribute to social causes. This will help to align the program with Uniswap’s values and mission.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
In the case of Uniswap’s proposal to use Flipside to attract new users through bounties, the concerns about centralization of power and favouritism towards one service provider are valid. Giving Flipside too much control over the allocation of UNI to bounties and oversight of the program could create a situation where decisions are made based on the interests of Flipside rather than the interests of the Uniswap community. I would therefore suggest establishing clear guidelines for decision-making which are transparent and fair to ensure that decisions are made based on the interests of the Uniswap community rather than the interests of a single service provider. The community could then ensure that the proposal aligns with the community’s interests. This would also help to identify potential issues before they become contentious. Consideration of the long-term implications of the proposal and how it will affect the decentralization of the platform should be taken into account, for instance, If the proposal undermines the decentralization of Uniswap, it could harm the platform’s long-term prospects.

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
The decision to reimburse or not reimburse the affected parties in the Rari hack is a complex one. It depends on the severity of the exploit, the responsibility of the platform, and the platform’s reputation and trustworthiness. I would favour split reimbursement whereby the platform could choose to reimburse some of the affected parties and not others. For example, they could reimburse users who had their funds stolen due to platform negligence but not reimburse those who lost funds due to their own actions, such as sharing their private keys. This option would try to balance the responsibility between the platform and the users.

Goals for Arbitrum DAO:


Security: Remove all “training wheels” from the Arbitrum sequencer and all protocol functions. It’s important that now with the inception of the DAO that there is little permissioned access to the protocol but functions on top of it remain editable.


Increase adoption: Ethereum scales through optimistic rollups and Arbitrum being the most secure and functional rollup today remains the priority after security.


Cater to builders who use Arbitrum as their home. The best way to foster a community is to support the people who build the infrastructure for everyone. We need to ensure Arbitrum remains an attractive place for innovators to explore.

By design, DAOs are large, slow, and inefficient. Because of this, Arbitrum DAO should have a limited scope of influence, but have it govern the most important parts of the protocol (sequencer, multisig, etc.) Centraliztion for the purpose of accomplishing goals with defined budgets and time horizons are how I would vote to spend resources.

Overall Goals for the DAO
    The ultimate goal of the DAO is to align with the principles
of decentralization and also community-driven decision-making. The
aggressiveness in liquidity mining should reflect this in a way that
balance incentive to participate with long-term value and sustainability.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
1. How would I vote?
I would vote against this because it centralizes too much power to one service provider.
2. What amendments would I make to the proposal if any?
I would propose an amendment to reduce Flipsides control and involve other service providers in the exchange to diversify and decentralize power.
3. How would I approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
    I don't believe this question is as simple as; How much
centralization should we have? I believe that centralization should 
be evaluated differently given the complexity of the situation and 
the DAOs principles and ultimate goals. In this scenario with Flipside, 
I believe there should be much more decentralization. Even though this 
would mean reaching new users slower, giving Flipside 3/7 seats on the 
allocation committee and a third of the seats on the Oversight committee 
goes directly against the goals of the DAO. Ultimately, when alligning
with the principles of the DAO, decentralization should be the priority.
Efficiency should be sacrificed for decentralization, never the other way
around. This is why I believe centralization should fluctuate from 
situation to situation, if possible.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
How would I choose to handle this situation
    I would make an effort to provide as much of a refund as possible.
Specifically if the individuals affected had no control over what happened
I believe a full reimbursement is not only right, but necessary. It is
unfair to users if they had no control over the situation and still lost
their money. If the users are at fault, I don't believe any reimbursement
is required nor should it be provided at the expense of the project.
In any case where the project itself is at fault in any way, I believe at
the very least, a split reimbursement is important, to show that the users
are a priority, and their well-being is taken into account. I believe this
aligns with the principles of the DAO, where even though there is some
centralization, ultimately they are not in it for their own gain.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
For me the most important goal of the DAO is to stimulate the healthy and decentralized (!) growth of the protocol. Decisions made by the members should be in the best interest of the DAO as a whole, taking into account the long term perspective and best interests of further development.
In case of liquidity minining I would prefere golden mean as too agressive approach increase risk significantly. Agressive approach is awesome in short term.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

I would recommend to introduce regular control votings for DAO members. They would be conducted in order to assure if members are still okay with the centralization of voting power.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Centralization of authority may be good way to improve DAO efficiency in long run. The compromise here should be based on mutual trust - rest of DAO members should have still ability to approve or disapprove the decisions.

Hacks are the nightmare for cryptospace. They devastate the trust and confidence of the wider audience of users. Having that in mind I would choose to make a partial Reimbursement. I think that ‘full’ option could be too difficult to implement in that case, as it would be devastating for the DAO.
I think that assuring members that in case of hacks they will not be leaved alone is valuable for the whole DAO.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
My goal is to create legitimacy, credible neutrality, and sustainability in DAOs. We need DAOs to execute on their promise of allocating resources better than their web 2 counterparts - corporations. By leading the industry in pluralistic allocation mechanisms, Arbitrum can be more decentralized while enjoying faster ecosystem growth. Most importantly, I bring lessons from Gitcoin as a former Grants Operations lead with the Gitcoin Holdings company before serving 6 seasons as the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream lead.

Sample Voting Issue 1:

1. How would you vote?  Against
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any? I would suggest that they instead use a combination of more pluralistic mechansims including quadratic funding and retroactive funding. It would be better for them to identify success criteria and start with a smaller amount. My issue isn’t with Flipside’s number of seats, it is the amount they are requesting without clarity of output. The amounts are relative requiring a unique evaluation in context of the DAO and it’s overall funding goals.
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done? I would identify the types of outcomes they are looking for. Is this program intended to give the community voice? Is it intended to efficiently allocated capitol to existential development needs? Is it meant to spur innovation or community growth? Most communities have multiple needs. An excellent exercise for thinking through this is to use Blockscience Social-Technical Frequency Mapping method of identifying task latency vs technical expertise. Then we can determine what success looks like for each quadrant. I’d love to help Arbitrum utilize tools & methodology like this.

Split Reimbursement
I believe that the DAO can change its mind anytime before the action has been taken on-chain. This recently happened to me with Gitcoin DAO choosing to revote on my workstream’s final budget. The important thing is that the DAO finds a way to maintain legitimacy. In my workstream situation, I advocated for an appeal process to be made so that in the future the DAO would have a fair way to deal with the situation. Similarly, I think the Rari situation calls for similar options. Ideally, the governance mechanism comes up with the best solution. Rather than proving one side or the other to be correct, it should pull out the best parts of both arguments and create a new solution. In this Rari case, I could see remuneration as a percentage of protocol profits over a certain amount of time being a reasonable solution.

My focus is not on liquidity mining. If we have to bribe people to use X, it suggests that X has no practical value. Instead, our priority is to develop useful and essential products that people require.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
I am against making any amendments to the proposal; instead, I believe it should be completely cancelled. The solution to most, if not all, of the problems related to DAO participation and token-weight voting is reputational avatars 16. In terms of the second voting issue, my decision would depend on the source of the reimbursement. If it involved an on-chain transfer block that could self-execute and remint the hacked amount into the accounts of the damaged parties, I would vote yes. However, if the cost was to be borne by tokenholders and other network participants, I would vote no. I don’t think it’s acceptable to socialize losses across a large number of people when it’s clear that only a small group of individuals are responsible for the insecure code and the theft of the funds.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
IRL Arbitrum community gatherings

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

Community, technical prowess and committed builders, be it Off Chain Labs or the protocols on Arbitrum, they have been the cornerstones of our success.
The DAO must take this base and prepare for the future, one that includes more chains (L3s, Anytrust), multiple programming languages that help bring us the next generation of Crypto builders and deliver on the promise of scaling Ethereum.
When creating incentive and grant programs we need to evolve beyond DeFi 1.0 liquidity mining programs, instead we need to find better measures for impact. This means incentivizing capital, protocols and activity that strengthen the ecosystem, and not which sit in isolation and don’t engage the rest of the ecosystem, simply accruing incentives before moving to the next chain.
If you are interested in learning more about my views on the DAO, feel free to contact me on twitter or telegram (details above)
Look forward to your support in helping to guide Arbitrum forward.

Personal investments across the Arbitrum ecosystem with a focus on DeFi
informally advised multiple protocols deployed or intending to deploy on Arbitrum on strategy, go to market and opportunities to collaborate
I inherently will have the desire to support protocols I’m involved in and which have proven themselves to be aligned with the goals of the DAO, I’m not big on a PvP style thinking instead seeing a much larger opportunity in building the space for all of us.
The protocols i’ve been involved with are leaders in the collaborative approach that has made Arbitrum such a unique place to build. GMX is the pre-eminent DeFi protocol on Arbitrum, with the largest TVL, volumes, fee generation and more importantly, nearly 100 protocols and partners integrated or building on top of it creating a chain-wide flywheel. Camelot has been singularly focused on helping protocols both new and existing deploy on Arbitrum, providing them with a DEX, staking services, and guidance on how to collaborate with a growing round table of builders across the ecosystem.
I do not believe any of the above would prevent me from using my best judgment to operate in the best interests of advancing the Arbitrum ecosystem. If you feel that it is not possible for me to separate my investments and roles from the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem and DAO, you are lucky as there are many other worthy candidates.

Sample Voting Issue 1: Uniswap / Flipside
Prompts to Answer: How would you vote?

Would vote “FOR” the proposal although would have preferred a more balanced proposal.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

staggered rotation of electing members to the allocation and oversight committees so that at the time of the one-year renewal of the program, the community has had the opportunity to update control if things are not progressing as intended.
Would not have the vendor on the oversight committee, but have a mechanism allowing them to propose actions and require these to be voted on.
Retain the 7-seat allocation committee size, but with a single seat for the vendor, and require 4/7 approval. This means the vendor can’t veto any proposal, and any proposal passing requires a majority of independent members.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

ultimate authority and control vests in the DAO, decentralization does not mean all activity needs to be implemented and executed directly by it. What is needed instead is delegation and accountability for those that perform actions for the DAO.
Large matters should be handled in a trustless fashion, but for operations trust but verify is a practical necessity.

Sample Voting Issue 2: FEI Hack
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

The split vote was a failure of governance. Such a fundamental event in the history of the DAO, should have gone through a more natural progression including allowing the contours of the decision to evolve with a final vote on along with the actual code for any resolution.
Split reimbursement would be the answer when dealing with an exploit or hack that strikes at the long-term viability of a platform. The goal should be that under the right circumstances, people could achieve a full reimbursement, through the future success of the platform continuing.
Founding, supporting and using DeFi protocols is an inherently risky endeavor, and its usage should never be assumed to have an implicit backstop thus creating an expectation of a risk-free return, risk must exist. Having said that, we should reward not punish early users who help to pave the way.
Compensation could be structured in the form of a debt-like instrument that receives a portion of protocol revenue, fees or recovery of funds, or issuance of vest or escrowed tokens giving them a long-term interest in the revival of the protocol after this incident. The LEO token from the Bitfinex BTC hack was a great example of this in action.

In order to provide the best possible environment for its members, a DAO must consider their survival, especially in cases where the DAO has been hacked. It is important for the DAO to assess the specific circumstances and type of hack, as draining members’ funds could potentially be detrimental to their ability to recover.
In situations such as the FEI hack, the DAO should prioritize returning funds to affected members, perhaps through a vesting system. Alternatively, the DAO could take proactive steps to protect its users’ interests and prevent similar attacks in the future. Overall, the DAO must act in the best interests of its members and prioritize their well-being in all decisions.

Transparency - The DAO should operate in a transparent manner, with all decisions and transactions being publicly visible.


Decentralization - The DAO should be decentralized, with decision-making power distributed amongits members


Efficiency - The DAO should strive to operate efficiently, with clear and streamlined decision-making processes.


Sustainability - The DAO should aim for long-term sustainability, with a focus on creating value for its members over the long term.


Innovation - The DAO should encourage innovation and creativity among its members, with a focus on developing new and innovative solutions to problems.


Overall, the goals of a DAO will depend on the specific context in which it operates, but the principles of transparency, decentralization, efficiency, sustainability, and innovation should guide its overall direction.

To improve the grant allocation process, it would be more advisable to distribute the funds on a quarterly basis, rather than simply dividing them into Year 1 and Year 2, especially for a sizable allocation of 25 million. Although the initial plan was to allocate half of the funds to staff employment, it would be wise to have the reserve upfront. While delivering the funds once a year may save some time on transactions and communication, introducing at least quarterly separations would be a more prudent approach.

Moreover, it would be beneficial to implement checkpoints throughout the delegation period, aside from having a committee that handles immediate grant-related matters. Regular votes could ensure that the DAO is comfortable with such a large allocation, and also encourage the grantee to increase accountability and provide accountability reports.
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
- There is an inherent trade-off between effectiveness and decentralization. While centralization may be necessary for certain specialized tasks that require quick and knowledgeable action, it ultimately depends on the approval of the DAO and operates as transparently as possible. Therefore, centralizing points are a necessary tool for the development of the DAO, as long as they remain transparent and accountable to the DAO.
When specialists are needed for a task, a DAO should consider having centralized points to handle the task efficiently. This is particularly important as the general members of the DAO may struggle with certain tasks. However, the entities in charge of these centralizing points should be trusted members of the space.
Sample Voting Issue 2: Rari Hack Reinbursement
3. Split reimbursement
The occurrence of hacks and loss of funds continues to be a significant barrier to building trust in the blockchain space and getting more people onboard. When large-scale draining of protocol contracts happens, the concept of Financial Legos becomes threatened, and people become less willing to connect with other protocols.
To address this issue, I believe that protocols should at least consider providing partial reimbursement to the parties that have cooperated with them. These parties have trusted the security of the smart contracts, and their trust and dedication should be acknowledged by trying to provide some funds back. DAO insurance protocols are already being developed in the space, which could potentially handle this in the future.
However, when the hack severely impacts the protocol, a full reimbursement may not be feasible, and it could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral. While providing compensation is essential to thank the participants for engaging in the system, a full reimbursement could have an equally devastating impact, similar to a second hack. Therefore, it’s crucial to provide enough compensation that can help these stakeholders without risking the DAO’s sustainability.

 Arbitrum:


Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?



If the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program, it may pose a risk of centralization of power and bias towards one service provider. Therefore, if I were a stakeholder in the decision-making process, I would consider voting against the proposal or advocating for significant amendments that address the concerns raised.
Regarding the amendments that could be made to the proposal, one approach could be to redistribute the allocation of seats in the committees, so that no single entity has an undue advantage or control. For instance, more seats could be given to independent entities, including other analytics service providers or community representatives, to ensure a fair and balanced decision-making process.
Another approach could be to increase transparency and accountability in the program’s operations, such as implementing public reporting mechanisms, regular audits, or setting clear criteria for the allocation of bounties.
In terms of the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, it is essential to find the right balance that maximizes the benefits of both aspects while minimizing the risks. Centralization can lead to faster and more efficient decision-making, but it can also limit diversity, creativity, and innovation. Decentralization can increase participation, transparency, and accountability, but it can also be slower and more cumbersome.
Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the specific context and goals of the program and find the optimal governance structure that aligns with them. It may require a compromise between different stakeholders’ interests and values, but ultimately, the goal should be to create a sustainable and inclusive ecosystem that benefits everyone involved.",848

DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization where decision-making takes place based on the voting of participants. The purpose of a DAO depends on its members and their mission. However, in most cases, the goal of a DAO is to maximize profit or create value for its members.On the issue of liquidity extraction, the optimal approach depends on the specific situation. It is important to balance between maximizing profits and maintaining stability. There are various strategies for extracting liquidity, such as raising liquidity through incentives, distributing tokens to participants using an incentive system, or introducing additional protocols to support liquidity.It is important to understand that DAO is a decentralized structure and decision-making takes place through the voting of participants. Therefore, in order to achieve common goals, it is necessary to actively communicate and discuss within the DAO in order to make informed decisions based on consensus.
Full Reimbursement - This may not be a fair solution, as it may create an incentive for attackers to carry out attacks against the DAO, knowing that they will be reimbursed. However, if this is the only way to keep the trust of the participants and keep the DAO stable, then this may be the right decision.No Reimbursement - This might be the right decision if the DAO was designed to refuse compensation in the event of an exploit. However, this can lead to a loss of trust among participants and a decrease in the stability of the DAO.Separate Reimbursement - This may be a fairer solution if the DAO can only identify and compensate those participants who were actually affected by the exploit. However, this may be more difficult to implement in practice and may take longer than other options.As a result, the decision should be made based on the overall goals and principles of the DAO, as well as taking into account the opinions of the participants and the situation as a whole. The core principles that should guide a DAO are transparency, accountability, and profit maximization for all participants.

Overall goals for the DAO: The DAO should strike a balance between aggressive growth and long-term sustainability. Liquidity mining should be employed with caution to avoid unnecessary risks while promoting user adoption and retention. The main goal of the DAO should be fostering a decentralized, fair, and secure ecosystem for its users and developers.
Sample Voting Issue 1: Vote: Against
Amendments: To address concerns about centralization, the proposal should be amended to redistribute seats on the allocation and oversight committees to include a broader range of participants, such as other analytics service providers and community representatives.
Tradeoff Approach: The tradeoff between centralization and efficiency can be managed by ensuring fair representation of various stakeholders in governance decisions, with clear guidelines and checks and balances to maintain transparency and accountability.
Sample Voting Issue 2: Choice: Split Reimbursement
Handling the Situation: I would opt for split reimbursement to balance the interests of affected parties and acknowledge the DAO’s responsibility in the situation. This approach encourages platform security improvements without establishing a precedent of full reimbursement, which could inadvertently incentivize reckless behavior.
Refund Instances: Refunds should be considered on a case-by-case basis, with factors like the extent of user losses, the project’s responsibility, and the impact on the ecosystem weighed in each decision. Instances where the project is directly responsible for the exploit should lead to reimbursement, while cases stemming from user negligence or external factors should not warrant reimbursement.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is an important consideration in any organization, including a DAO. On the one hand, a centralized authority can make decisions quickly and efficiently, but it can also lead to potential abuses of power and lack of transparency. On the other hand, a decentralized approach can lead to more transparency and democratic decision-making, but it may also lead to slower decision-making processes and inefficiencies.

Liquidity mining is something that should only be focused on when value is either being lost or over inflated. Liquidity mining should be left alone. Unless the assets used to liquidity mine has a stable passive yield. Also with sound assets to liquidity mine behind it. The goal of the DAO is to increase adoption of an cheaper, transparent, faster ecosystem that can aid in supporting the world’s growing technological infrastucture needs.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex issue that requires balancing competing concerns. On the one hand, a centralized authority structure can make decision-making more efficient and streamlined, enabling faster action and potentially reducing the potential for conflict or disagreement. On the other hand, centralization can also lead to a concentration of power and decision-making authority in the hands of a few individuals or groups, potentially limiting the input and participation of other stakeholders.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
1.Full Reimbursement
When a hack occurs in a DAO, it is important to first take steps to mitigate the immediate damage and prevent further losses. This could involve identifying and fixing any vulnerabilities in the system, securing remaining assets, and investigating the extent of the hack.
Once the immediate situation has been addressed, it is important to assess the impact of the hack on members of the DAO and any potential repercussions for the organization as a whole. In the case of the FEI RARI hack, it seems that a significant number of members were affected.
It is important to ensure that the process is transparent and fair. This could involve establishing clear criteria for eligibility, setting a reasonable timeframe for claims, and providing a clear and accessible process for submitting and verifying claims.

3. Split reimbursement - rationale - Although the total amount of hacks & scams in web3 is relatively small (less than 2%) compared to the amount of honest/good projects. It is still the focal point of scare that stops it from going towards mass adoption. Bad PR is just bad for the entire web3 industry. To improve upon the psychological safety of new entrants into the system there should at least be a fractional reimbursement option (similar to fractional options with FDIC-insured banking). In the larger picture, it also depends on who was the culprit & if there is a way to recover. I would think of also building a conviction voting-based mechanism to rapidly gain insights from fellow DAO contributors on something like this in real-time.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:


How would you vote?
Against


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?



DAO proposals for grants should not be pegged to fiat, especially at these amounts. 25M USD grant over two years no matter the price of UNI is a very hard burden on UNI to carry. It should have been based on UNI.
Flipside should be introduced and doxxed (where needed) in the introduction.
It should be explained what is DAO’s interest in giving away bounties to user who has not touched Uniswap before. I personally doubt if people who has not touched Uniswap in web3 are the target audience for a bounty.
Pilot program data should be substantiated. What is the understanding from ‘retention’? Did they retain after pilot bounties ended, or did they hold on because there were more bounties?
DAO should have discussed multiple projects, maybe there could be multiple proposals from different projects, not just Flipside.
DAO paying for the project owner’s employee salaries, database and node management does not make sense.
Giving control of funds only to farm yield should be well thought of.
3 people from Flipside in the allocation committee is not acceptable, not only because they are over-represented but also because Flipside’s all costs are reimbursed and their corporate interests are not aligned with the DAO. Seats should either consist of ethically unbiased opinion leaders and or DAO members that have aligned individual interests.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
With proper checks and balances protecting the DAO’s interests, it could be accepted but very important that temporary deviations do not go against the principles, ideas and goals of the DAO, ehich brought the community together in the first place.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
Issue Overview:
FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

No Reimbursement

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
This is a textbook case showing the need for DAO Constitutions. I am a lawyer and in law, either in court judgment or jury verdict, same questions shall not be asked twice, unless there is material changes that revealed later which could have affected the decision. A well-structured DAO (either by code or community consensus) should not allow proposals to ask same questions based on same material facts. But if somehow asked, then the most recent DAO decision should be honored. I was not able to find the vetoed proposal on the web to check if there is any material difference to what the DAO said no and yes.
Ethically I am in favor of reimbursement in a hack of this nature, so personally it is a desired outcome for me. But preserving the trust in the DAO is much more important. Second proposal should have been clear in what it is asking or should not be allowed to ask the same question.

Hi guys I am most interested in Gaming development on Arbitrum Nova as well as Defi Development like Gmx type protocols with orderbooks.
For sample too my though process would be as such ,
Full Reimbursement: This option would mean that all the parties affected by the hack would receive a complete refund of the funds lost. The advantage of this approach is that it would provide immediate relief to those who suffered losses, restoring their trust in the platform and possibly avoiding legal action. However, the downside is that it could set a precedent for future hacks, incentivizing users to take more risks and not take enough precautions when handling funds.
No Reimbursement: This option would mean that those who suffered losses would not receive any refund, which would put the responsibility on the users to manage their funds more securely. The advantage of this approach is that it would discourage risky behavior, encourage users to adopt best practices for securing their funds and possibly help prevent future hacks. However, the downside is that it could lead to a loss of trust in the platform, discouraging users from participating in it in the future.
Split Reimbursement: This option would mean that parties affected by the hack would receive a partial refund of their losses, while also sharing some of the responsibility for the hack. The advantage of this approach is that it would encourage users to take more responsibility for their funds and also provide some relief to those who suffered losses. However, the downside is that it could be seen as unfair by some parties, especially those who took significant precautions to secure their funds.",865

We believe that the Arbitrum DAO should primarily focus on two areas:

Supporting the development of new and needed applications
Helping onboard new users who would benefit from the applications on Arbitrum

As the native DEX and launchpad for new projects on Arbitrum, Camelot is uniquely positioned to help with both of these areas. Our Round Table Protocols represent the majority of applications on Arbitrum and together, they help make Arbitrum and Camelot a collaborative and supportive home for innovation.
Sample Voting Issue 1

Against
Such large DAO token allocations should generally only be made for programs which are overwhelmingly popular. The mere fact that the vote is nearly 50/50 should show that it probably shouldn’t pass. To make the vote less contentious, we would probably recommend reducing the payment schedule to monthly or quarterly instead of annually (making the DAOs upfront commitment smaller by an order of magnitude). We might even recommend introducing a trial period which is only continued if the trial hits certain performance metrics.
DAOs should always try to maximize the accountability of individuals and entities that interact with them. Paying for services on a performance basis should almost always be preferred, and DAOs should try to structure compensation plans that align incentives. Especially in decentralized environments involving anonymous individuals, economic incentives must be aligned to ensure quality outcomes.

Sample Voting Issue 2
The first vote should have triggered a trustless execution of the hack repayment. It’s unclear what to do after two such votes when neither had executable code tied to their outcomes. Thus, we would never put such a monumental vote to governance without the executable code attached.
The reimbursement amount should be determined by the token holders as they have the long term interest of the project in mind. If executable code had been attached to the first vote, they would have fully reimbursed the hack victims. If token holders directly voted for this code to be executed, it would have been the right outcome.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex issue, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution that can be applied universally. However, some general principles and strategies that can be helpful in approaching this tradeoff include the following:

Balance delegation of authority with accountability: Delegating decision-making authority to a smaller group of individuals or a single person can improve efficiency, but it can also lead to abuses of power and lack of transparency. To mitigate these risks, it is important to establish clear lines of accountability and transparency in decision-making processes.
Use technology to enable decentralized decision-making: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are an example of how technology can be used to enable decentralized decision-making while still maintaining some degree of efficiency. DAOs allow for community-driven decision-making, and they can leverage the power of blockchain technology to enable transparent and secure voting processes.
Foster a culture of collaboration and trust: Creating a culture of collaboration and trust can help ensure that decisions are made in the best interests of the organization and its stakeholders. This can be achieved through open communication, shared goals and values, and a willingness to compromise and work together.
Adapt the level of centralization to the context: The appropriate level of centralization will depend on the specific context and goals of the organization. In some cases, a more centralized approach may be necessary to achieve efficiency and effectiveness, while in others, a more decentralized approach may be more appropriate to ensure fairness and inclusivity.
Overall, the key to balancing centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is to be intentional, transparent, and adaptable in decision-making processes, while always keeping the best interests of the organization and its stakeholders in mind.

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

Split Reimbursement: This approach would involve reimbursing a portion of the losses incurred by the affected users, while also placing some responsibility on the users to take adequate security measures. This approach could strike a balance between immediate relief and creating a precedent for future hacks. It could also incentivize users to take security measures seriously while also ensuring that the platform takes some responsibility for the security breach.

IRL Arbitrum community gatherings

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Vote for problem 1
For.
I am in favor of this proposal. I believe that Uniswap is trying to attract new users to it and it is important that they earn rewards to encourage usage. However, I understand concerns about centralization and equity. So I think it’s important that analytic service providers are included in the process and that there is equity in the seats in allocation tracking and oversight. Also, I believe there should be some oversight and monitoring to ensure that rewards are distributed fairly. I am therefore voting in favor of this proposal on the condition that all relevant service providers are included in the process and that there is equity in the dinner seats.


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would make certain amendments to the proposal to make it less centralized. First, I would reduce the number of Flipside seats on the Allocation Committee to 1/3 and on the Oversight Committee to 1/7. This would allow other stakeholders more voice and equal opportunity. In addition, it would open up the proposal to other analytic service providers so that they could compete for seats on the allocation committee. This would improve transparency and confidence in the Uniswap program. Finally, Dune and Leshner could have seats on the oversight committee to ensure the proposal passes fairly.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I believe that DAO decisions should be made collaboratively. This means that all DAO participants must be given the opportunity to be involved in the decision-making process and given opportunities to voice their opinions. This could include engaging analytics service providers so that everyone can verify the accuracy of the data, as well as involving campus clubs to ensure that everyone’s views are heard. However, I believe it is important to maintain transparency and avoid any form of centralization of power. This means that all seats on the allocation and oversight committee must be open access and must not be limited to a single individual.


Vote for problem 2:
I would choose option 3, Split Refund. In this solution, users who were affected by the hack would receive a partial refund. This would allow the company to recover from the damage sustained by the attack, while still offering some help to users. Split reimbursement could also be based on the number of users affected, as well as the severity of the damage each of them suffered. Users who suffered more severe losses could receive a larger refund. Additionally, Rari could consider using insurance funds to cover part of the damage, as well as encouraging users to take safety measures to prevent the same problem from occurring in the future.

Improving Governance participation
Public Goods funding

Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO:


Arbirtum’s DAO should continue to focus on making Ethereum accessible for everyone. Arbitrum is a public goods infrastructure L2 enablement platform to bring Web3, crypto, ReFi, NFTs, DAOs, and more to life for everyone on Earth. Continue to provide an amazing experience for anyone to tap into the Ethereum ecosystem with low costs and high speeds for a great user experience for even my mom.


Arbitrum needs to slowly decentralize leadership as it continues to grow in influence as the leading Ethereum L2. Involve universities, non-profits, and diverse opinions that represent the true user population and not just crypto bros and JPG flippers.


Lastly Arbritrum needs to focus on growing the AnyTrust chain ecosystem to achieve adoption outside of our current circles of influence. Expanding to organizations that are working to adopt Web3 and are currently embracing Web 2.5 and how hybrid blockchains could benefit their organizations.


P.S. Liquidity mining could be beneficial with the right approach. For example to spur AnyTrust ecosystem growth as well as to stimulate specific verticals within the Arbitrum ecosystem that have not taken off on their own (like DeFi), however, simply giving away equity has proven to not be successful alone (per Uniswap air drop research). The best practice today is to be targeted and specific with liquidity mining and to do it over time.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
1. How would you vote?
Against
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I agree with Saludiego201.eth that “Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO” which is a public good. For specific amendments, I have 3 suggestions.


I propose the allocation committee can only have 1 representative per organization.


The Allocation Committee and Oversight Committee could consider adding rules that limit overlap with representatives between Committees if there are additional representatives available.


I would suggest that Flipside propose at least one competitor for the DAO to review. Ideally, multiple analytics vendors (Dune, Flipside, +) could be given the same access to the grant if they can provide the same offering to the DAO.


3. How would you approach the tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Centralized authority is helpful to start an ecosystem and over time it should be moved to a decentralized authority that takes more time to get things done.
New projects and experiments need centralization to accomplish set goals. Public Goods ecosystems like Arbitrum require the decentralization of leadership and power to truly serve the people who use the ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 2:

Split Reimbursement

I suggest an option with payouts that are evenly split across victim addresses, capped by the amount of damages for each victim. This results in a single max payout threshold, where victims falling below this threshold are fully repaid.
Investors cannot hold Web3 protocols responsible to make them 100% whole due to a hack since the investors were never promised this benefit from FEI RARI when they invested in the protocol. At the same time, the protocol should do their best to make investors whole. Hence the split payout.
Addresses that have already received hack compensation from Nexus Mutual are excluded.
Addresses have attempted to exploit this dynamic by splitting their cTokens across multiple addresses. These splits should not be respected,
P.S. I know too well what it’s like to lose in a hack. I lost 20 ETH in the Cream.Finance hack in 2021 and learned a good lesson, only invest what you can lose in DeFi without insurance.

Supporting Infrastructure

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a firm believer in decentralization, I strongly advocate for the overall goals of the DAO to prioritize the long-term sustainability and success of not only the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups. The DAO should play a crucial role in overseeing technical protocol and security upgrades, ensuring that the ecosystem remains healthy and secure. It is important to strike a balance between decentralization and the need for knowledgeable oversight, which is why a technical subcommittee could be established to assist with this governance aspect.
Regarding liquidity mining, while it can be useful in the short term for user acquisition, it should not become a permanent feature of any protocol as it may lead to unsustainable emissions. As for grants, they should be handled with care and accountability to ensure that builders are delivering on their promises, but they also offer a great opportunity for the development of much-needed tools and dApps.
Ultimately, the DAO should focus on creating a decentralized and sustainable ecosystem that empowers community members to participate in the growth and development of the rollup.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would propose amendments to ensure that the allocation and oversight committees are more inclusive and that other analytics service providers are involved in the proposal.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?


I believe that the DAO should prioritize inclusivity and fairness over the ability to get things done quickly. While centralization of authority may seem like an efficient way to accomplish tasks, it can compromise the integrity of the system and create opportunities for abuse of power

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

Full Reimbursement
I choose Full Reimbursement because it is the most just and fair way to compensate the parties affected by the hack. However, the DAO should also conduct due diligence to ensure that the parties claiming reimbursement are genuine and not fraudulent. In instances where parties cannot prove their claim, no reimbursement should be made.

The specific goals of the Arbitrum DAO would depend on the particular use case.

Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 
Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.
Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?



 For
[v] Against (My chose)


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any? More transparency and avoid concentrating too much control in one hands.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done? Avoid overlap of power in a one sector and keep ability for a clear election.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.

Each of the options has its own pros and cons, and it ultimately depends on the platform’s priorities and values.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation


Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
My personal beliefs as well as core Premia tenets are outlined below, however as a representative of the Premia Community, all major decisions will be coordinated with the Premian Parliament (Elected Community Representatives), before any potentially conflicting votes are applied.
Main Objective: To maintain the competitive advantages that the Arbitrum Ecosystem currently occupies.

Arbitrum has an extremely intelligent and vibrant DeFi community.  In my opinion all innovation has been or is currently being deployed on Arbitrum. The interoperability of protocols is second to none other than potentially mainnet itself, we will only support proposals that further this entrenchment unhindered.
Both in support of the developer relations that Offchain & Arbitrum provide, but also the level of documentation and polish of developer experience has led us to further commit to building in the Arbitrum Ecosystem, any proposals that continue to invest in these domains we will strongly support.
The incentive ethos of Premia is to always reward long term participation over short sighted solutions and token mechanisms (however unfavorable they may be).  This can be seen with our 10yr token emission schedule from the inception of the Premia platform.  We will stand with all proposals that enforce long term growth over short term economic gain. However it is not directly outlined in the Arbitrum constitution or documentation, we believe based on historic interactions, this is also core to the Arbitrum ethos, favoring community building, rapport, and trust above all else.

Community, Security, Privacy, and Economic Sustainability are core values we strive to uphold.  Investment Access, Open Markets, and Responsible Finance are key to our vision to achieve these values.  In principle, the Premia Community will vote their delegation towards equality of wealth, equity of opportunity, & economic freedom rooted resolutions, and these tenets we believe coincide with the overall goals of the Arbitrum DAO, and we will do our part to protect these tenets.

Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1: Uniswap
Prompts to Answer:
1.  How would you vote? : Against
2.  What amendments would you make to the proposal if any? : Uniswap Token Holders should elect the Oversight Committee. Instead of 10mm at once, it should be released in smaller quarterly amounts with more ongoing checks by oversight committee.
3.  How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done? : I have no problem with how the Allocation committee was set up, however the Oversight Committee should be all external to the receiving party.  Centralization is necessary for the benefits in coordination, however oversight should be external as we fall into the age old question of “Who watches the watchmen?.”  However my overall stance on the proposal is that it is not their domain to act as an investment fund, and thus it is not their core expertise. To achieve the desired result they should have either partnered with a group who does have expertise, or rethink the funding plan to stick to their domain.

Sample Voting Issue 2: FEI RARI
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Split Reimbursement : Partial reimbursement I think would have been the appropriate step forward.  FEI tokenholders voted to incorporate RARI into the ecosystem, and initially voted to reimburse, thus should have to socialize partial losses, with some sort of claim mechanism for the remaining and a multi-year plan to compensate individuals who lost capital in the exploit.  If they chose not to take this path, then the only other option would be shut down the protocol, which I guess is what ultimately happened.  This is a good example of how poor security practices and protocol management can lead to the end of strong technical development team.  Bitfinex encountered a hack, socialized losses, issued a method to claim, and ultimately was able to battle through the challenges through transparent communication and commitment to a resolution.

Looking to the area of interest, I am interested in Gaming Development on arbitrum and DeFi Development on Arbitrum. Since it’s way more scalable.
The primary goal of the DAO should be to create a decentralized ecosystem that enables high scalability and interoperability. This can be achieved by leveraging blockchain technology and implementing innovative solutions such as sharding, sidechains, and layer 2 protocols.
In terms of liquidity mining, the DAO should adopt a balanced approach that incentivizes participation while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. The DAO should also prioritize the security and decentralization of the network, as these are critical factors for building trust and attracting more users.
A possible timeline roadmap for the DAO could include the following milestones:


Phase 1: Research and development of high scalability solutions, such as sharding and sidechains. This phase should also include the creation of a governance framework for the DAO and the establishment of partnerships with other blockchain projects.


Phase 2: Launch of the DAO’s mainnet and implementation of liquidity mining programs to incentivize participation. This phase should also focus on building a robust developer community and expanding the ecosystem through strategic partnerships and collaborations.


Phase 3: Integration of layer 2 protocols to further enhance scalability and interoperability. This phase should also include the implementation of advanced security measures and the development of decentralized applications (dApps) that showcase the potential of the DAO’s ecosystem.


Phase 4: Continued growth and expansion of the DAO’s ecosystem, with a focus on building a sustainable and decentralized network that can compete with traditional centralized systems. This phase should also include the exploration of new use cases for blockchain technology and the development of innovative solutions that can benefit society as a whole.

3.The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a common challenge for any organization, including DAOs. On one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear leadership and decision-making, leading to faster execution and more efficient use of resources. On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision-making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of the wider community.

We are most interested in contributing to these 2 fronts:

NFT development on Arbitrum
Supporting Infrastructure

On overall goals for the DAO:
We think the overall goals for the DAO should be to safeguard the core values we strive for in web3, including decentralization, permissionless open access, censorship resistance, transparent governance, etc.
While at the same time, being able to make decisions in an efficient way and encourage new innovations are also quite important, especially in the current environment where we see increasing “competition” on Ethereum L2 scaling solutions. DAO governance should avoid becoming a lengthy bureaucratic process that stifles innovations.
In terms of liquidity mining, we take a neutral stance in general. And we can share more informed views after getting more details regarding the proposed mechanism. We tend to agree that liquidity mining is an essential mechanism that provides the proper incentive to attract more activities and development, while at the same time, fairness of distribution is important, and we don’t want to see the system becoming “overly financialized”.
Sample Voting Issue 1 (Uniswap / Flipside Crypto):

How would you vote?

We will vote for it. We think overall, the grant is aligned with the interests of the Uniswap community at large, given it is expected to drive new participants to the Uniswap ecosystem. While we recognize the fact that this proposal may come across as favoritism (picking Flipside Crypto vs. other analytics players), we think as long as proper diligence has been done and a governance structure with an oversight committee has been set up, it will mitigate potential conflict of interests.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

While we will vote for it, we still want to see more details regarding how the funding will be allocated and that the proper check and balance mechanism is in place, to avoid potential interest misalignment and moral hazard.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

We will outline a few principles to evaluate such situations, to assess if any core value will be meaningfully compromised. After we reach a certain level of conviction that there is no material compromise on core values, we will prioritize to get things done (vs. being overly cautious that might slow things down).
Sample Voting Issue 2 (FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement):
Should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not?
We support Full Reimbursement, for the following reasons:


In this case and other similar cases, despite dApp’s decentralization or self-custody narrative, we believe there is still an implied fiduciary obligation by the dApp to users, given a different level of information and responsibilities - you can’t expect the users to read through every code and decide to trust the dApp purely based on the quality of the code, in truth users still entrust their asset to the dApp, and the dApp often has made such implicit promises or created such expectation of proper user protection.


In order for web3 to get mass adoption, the developers and communities should take up the responsibility to protect users - who may have only limited knowledge about blockchain and crypto, and have to rely on the dApp service providers / DAOs.


While at the same time, there may be cases that a Full Reimbursement will create greater harm to the community at large - e.g.  such Full Reimbursement leads to a liquidity crunch and financial distress. In such cases, some kind of Partial Reimbursement and restructuring plan should be considered.

Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO:


Boosting multi-chain development for the DAO
What we can do for DAO is provide various cross-chain services.
MultiDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization created by multi-chain communities to promote the establishment of a free and connected MultichainVerse. We support the incubation and acceleration of native multi-chain applications on Arbitrum.
In addition, Multichain provides a fast-withdrawal service to avoid long pending statuses for users. We have the highest transaction volume and the most users on Arbitrum. We have also helped more than 100 projects migrate to Arbitrum to expand its ecosystem.
References:
https://defillama-ui-git-bridge-dash-defillama-team.vercel.app/bridges/Arbitrum


Enhancing governance and increasing the efficiency of the DAO.
The goal of a DAO is to provide a transparent and decentralized governance structure and boost the development of multi-chain ecosystems, where decisions are made by a community rather than a centralized authority. The use of blockchain technology allows for trustless and secure decision-making, as well as increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness.



Sample Voting Issue 1:


How would you vote? For or Against?
Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal, if any?
Change the seat ratio of the committee so that the service provider does not hold the majority of seats on the committee.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The relationship between centralization and the ability to get things done is positive in some aspects, but more centralization does not guarantee better efficiency. We aim to strike a balance to ensure power is decentralized and benefits each party in the DAO. However, a professional team within the DAO should execute the decision to maintain efficiency.



Sample Voting Issue 2:


Full Reimbursement
Full reimbursement is vital for the community and the whole web3 industry, maintaining the DAO’s trust, reputation, and customer care. However, the DAO needs to reserve assets for reimbursement before any hack. The assets for reimbursement should not be taken from the stakeholders’ income.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
2. No Reimbursement
The DAO treasury is not supposed to be used for reimbursement in the event of a hack, even more so if the hack is due to a smart contract vulnerability. Rather than refunding, a better use of funds would rather be to allocate part of the treasury to the prevention of future hacks: bug bounty missions, increase the number of audits carried out, so that a hack does not happen again . For example, allocating $8 million for this purpose rather than reimbursing $80 million will have a much more beneficial long-term impact.

Arbitrum DAO should pursue the goals of developing the Arbitrum ecosystem. Since the understanding of “development” is subjective, in which direction development should go should be determined by the skin in the game of the voters. Who has more skin in the game, he gets more voice power (better not linearly).
The main thing is that the public interest in an ecosystem should be above the individual if it conflicts.
But it is better to try to build architecture and systems that have co-directed initiatives for society and individuals, when it is beneficial for the individual to help each other and whole community/DAO.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I think the proposal is very well crafted in terms of what needs to be achieved (sticky liquidity), analysis of those results and possible adjustments, and community building, but I also feel that decentralization suffers in this proposal. And my opinion, that decentralization matters a lot.
In my opinion, Flipside should have received a maximum of 2 seats in the allocation committee, not have seats at all on the Oversight committee, and in addition to Flipside, at least the same conditions should have been offered to other analytical services, and criteria for choosing between these analytical tools should have been set, otherwise it looks like nepotism.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I don’t see a big problem here. A decentralized community should clearly set goals and make competitive competitions for these tasks, and competent teams that win these competitions must perform these tasks by virtue of their competencies without agreeing on each decision. The progress of the task and the result of the solution of the task should be checked by the committee, which changes with sufficient frequency.

I think the protocol should have at least split reimbursement, cause the team behind the protocol are ultimately the root cause of the hack, as they are the ones who wrote the code (users have responsibility on that too, but less).
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
At the moment, almost all projects have a project treasury, or even a special fund for “contingencies” that must be used. I think these funds should always be used to cover the loss of users of the protocol if the protocol invited users to use it (disclaimers that this is alpha or beta version of protocol should not be taken seriously, no one ever looks at them). Also, if the protocol continues to generate income, then some part of this income should also continue to be reimbursed so as not to fail the faith of the people who first try the protocol with their money.
The only situation where I think a user should not receive a refund is when the product had no marketing whatsoever and someone just deployed the contract to the network for their own purposes without naming it as a product anywhere, without having any marketing or offering to use it. In this case, the blame for the loss of money lies entirely with the user, since he himself chose to use someone else’s contract on the network.

DeFi development on Arbitrum


Improving Governance participation


Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
We believe that the high-level goal of the Arbitrum DAO is simple: to support the growth of Arbitrum and its projects in a decentralized, sustainable and fair manner. This should be done through active governance participation by entities that are intimately familiar with the Arbitrum ecosystem and its participants. It is integral to ensure that there’s a collaborative spirit between delegates to advance and drive Arbitrum’s adoption and technological development forward.
In practice, this means supporting projects in a manner which makes Arbitrum an attractive place for builders to build. This should be the basis of any liquidity mining, grants and upgrades - in other words using those tools to attract talent, projects and capital that are aligned with Arbitrum and it’s future direction.
PlutusDAO is in a truly unique position to be a key delegate in driving forward the goals listed above. We have a rare combination that predicts success in this role - Plutus has been a part of the Arbitrum ecosystem for over a year now and our core products revolve around governance aggregation.
We’re extremely interwoven into the Arbitrum ecosystem, deeply understand the needs of projects building on it and have actual cross-team governance collaboration experience. It’s for this reason that we believe Plutus to be an extremely strong delegate candidate that has Arbitrum’s best interests in mind. Arbitrum’s success is close to our heart and we want to play a key role in steering its future! 
Sample Voting Issue 1:


Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.


For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.


This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.


Prompts to Answer:
1. How would you vote?
Against
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
To ensure fairness and alignment of incentives, the allocation committee and oversight committee should be more decentralized. It’s key to have Flipside on the allocation committee for key updates and insights, but not necessary on the oversight committee. Yearly funding should be reduced to quarterly periods with added KPIs to ensure that the project is moving in the right direction. Often the issue with grants are lack of accountability and incorrect sizing - with this solution, both could have been avoided!
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
As long as key goals and objectives are clearly defined before starting a project and governance participants are aligned towards a common high-level goal, the tradeoff between centralization of authority and ability to get things done is actually not as polarizing as it may otherwise be.
As a backdrop to all DAO decision-making, it’s crucial to ensure there’s a clear constitution, performance indicators and common objectives to measure actions against. Ideally decision-making should smoothly move from a birds-eye view to more granular topics, and for this an abundantly clear and rigorous governance process is required.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
1. Full Reimbursement


No Reimbursement


Split Reimbursement


The reimbursement topic in case of hacks is an extremely sensitive and nuanced topic. It undoubtedly brings ethics into the scope of decision-making in a large way and requires weighing out the facts of what has actually taken place carefully before making any decisions. While users bear the risk of using DeFi applications, we believe the DeFi space currently suffers from a distinct air of safety when using especially experimental and cutting-edge (at the time) DeFi apps such as Rari.
We believe that in case of hacks where a user is clearly not at fault, protocols should reimburse users in full as long as it is economically feasible and does not lead to the protocol going under. If the damage is too large to fully cover without bankrupting the protocol, a split reimbursement should be considered while planning and executing a path forward where users will eventually be repaid in full. Again, the topic is extremely nuanced but in the spirit of advancing the space and encouraging innovation, we heavily encourage protocols to take responsibility in the unfortunate event of an exploit.

My stance on the overall goals for the DAO is that it should be focused on creating a strong, resilient, and user-friendly protocol that is able to attract and retain users. The DAO should be open to new ideas and opportunities, but should also be judicious in its decision-making, weighing the potential rewards and risks associated with any new initiative. Additionally, the DAO should be proactive in engaging with the community and responding to feedback in order to ensure that decisions are made that are in the best interests of the entire ecosystem. Regarding liquidity mining, the goal should be to incentivize users to participate in the protocol in a sustainable way, while also making sure that any rewards are fairly distributed.
Sample Voting Issue 1: Against
I would approach this tradeoff by looking into ways to decentralize the decision-making process. This could include having multiple analytics service providers involved, increasing the number of seats on the allocations committee, or rotating members on the Oversight committee. Additionally, I would look into ways to increase transparency regarding the distribution of UNI to the bounties and ensure that there is no favoritism towards any particular service provider.
Sample Voting Issue 2: Split reimbursement and/or Full reimbursement
I believe that parties should be fully reimbursed for an exploit if the fault lies with the protocol and not the user. In these cases, the user has done nothing wrong and should not be punished for someone else’s mistake. If the user has been negligent or has taken risks that are beyond the scope of the protocol, they should be partially reimbursed or not reimbursed at all, depending on the severity of the mistake. Ultimately, the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, with the primary consideration being whether or not the fault lies with the protocol or the user. *Languages I speak and write: Spanish, English.",898

Sample Voting Issue 1:

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.

Our Take:


How would you vote?
Against


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
We suggest the following amendments:

Adjust the allocation committee to be comprised of more neutral parties with strict term limits and responsibilities, ensuring a fairer and less centralized process.
Separate the grants into quarterly distributions to enhance accountability and reduce the risk associated with large allocations delivered only once a year.
Establish clear KPIs for better assessment of the program’s success, rather than relying on vague transparency dashboards and committees.
Introduce checkpoints throughout the delegation period, encouraging routine votes and increased accountability from the grantee. This would ensure the DAO remains comfortable with the large allocation and promote transparency through regular reporting.
Break this proposal into multiple smaller proposals, covering aspects such as committee members, a grant proposal for Community-Enabled Analytics for Flipside, and guidelines on treasury funds management. This approach would avoid confusion and help voters better assess the proposal’s merits and drawbacks.



How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?


We advocate for progressive decentralization, viewing decentralization as a journey rather than an abrupt shift. Starting with complete decentralization can hinder decision-making efficiency, but gradually implementing strong governance frameworks can streamline the process. It takes time to establish elements such as proposal timelines, resource allocation framework, and process feedback loop, which help create a decentralized protocol that operates efficiently, transparently, and trustlessly.
A DAO should consider centralizing certain aspects when specialist knowledge and quick decision-making are required, which might be challenging for the broader DAO community. In such cases, trusted members with relevant expertise should be appointed to act on the DAO’s behalf.
While we believe that protocols should work towards decentralization, it is crucial to do so sustainably, ensuring that the protocol or DAOs remains efficient and resilient against potential exploitation. We look forward to supporting DAOs on its journey towards sustainable decentralization, striking a appropirate balance between centralization and decentralization at each stages, promoting effective decision-making and broad participation.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Issue Overview: FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement
Our take:
Full reimbursement - Handling reimbursement after a hack is a complex matter that requires a case-by-case assessment. When determining whether to distribute reimbursement, various factors should be considered, including the hack’s preventability, the parties bearing the cost of reimbursement, the potential impact on the protocol’s viability, the protocol’s plans post-hack, the DAO treasury’s size, and alternative reimbursement methods, such as revenue sharing to gradually repay affected parties.
In the first snapshot proposal, many of these questions were left unanswered, leading to potential uninformed decision-making that could be detrimental to the DAO. Given that Rari eventually deprecated their governance and protocol, it seems reasonable to utilize any remaining funds to compensate those affected. Nevertheless, this process must be approached with caution, taking into account the order and assets in which people are reimbursed. Moreover, if the available funds cannot cover all affected parties, the DAO should determine whether to fully compensate some users, distribute the funds evenly, or allocate them proportionally.
In situations like these, it is crucial to explore all options and maintain transparency with information. This approach enables voters to better understand the circumstances and make educated decisions, ultimately leading to more favorable outcomes.

On a neutral ground i do think liquidity mining is a sort of strategy deployed by DAOs to give back to their loyal community members who provide liquidity and were consistent in contributing to the project. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining is all on the project founders and what they are driving at. Liquidity mining can lead to a more improved and faster growth for the project in mid term,it increases liquidity and volatility as well.
There should be a balance with transparency,governance and protocol security. The end time purpose of the DAO should be based on the decision of the community.

The seats on both the allocation and oversight committees should be dispersed amongst a greater number of analytics service providers, thus preventing an accumulation of power and ensuring a diverse representation of interests.
How would I navigate the delicate balance between centralization of authority and the ability to accomplish our goals?

Sample Voting Issue 2:
How would I choose to handle this situation? I would choose Split Reimbursement.
In my judgment, split reimbursement represents a fair compromise in such cases. It acknowledges the shared responsibility of both the protocol, for its vulnerabilities, and the users, for their participation in a realm where risks are inherent. I believe reimbursement should be considered in instances where the exploit resulted from a clear fault in the protocol and the affected users were following the path of prudence. However, in cases where users ventured into risky territory or the vulnerability was not a direct consequence of the protocol’s design, reimbursement may not be warranted.

Sample Voting Issue 1:

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Goals for the DAO: i am so new to cryptocurrencies specially DAO. and I also follow some Dao less than 3 but while observing for proposal submission issues, there are many project proposals where not many communities know the flow of funds after the proposal is approved. Maybe it would be better if arbitrum had a tool that could see all the project funds. So the community doesn’t have to always look at the site explorer scan to check it

LET USERS DECIDE THE ACTIONS
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Identify the events that contains users involvement
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
based on the project treasury
Split Reimbursement
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Arbitrum with 18 months of Maninnet testing, becoming a block chain of preference by many protocols and has a huge community believing in it. This proves that the block chain is tried and tested with community suport and trust.The security experience and affordability has been proven till date by the blockchain and Protocols on it.
The DAO goals, being a decentralised entity with views, experience, expertise of diverse stakeholders and tokenholders will draw debates, opinions and judgements for the betterment of all involved with the DAO which is diverse will draw debates, opinions in the greater interest of the blockchain, DAO and community. The Arbitrum token holders who providing, in the best possible conditions, the financial advice and services that members need.
Contributing to the cooperative, economic and financial education of members, that is to provide them with a way to achieve independence. Promoting and supporting community development.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
One such recent case: Euler Finance hack :- $200mn.
The protocol considered as best and innovative in DeFi, team members of great experience and expertise, 6 smart contract audits still fell prey to the Hack. the bug bounty announced is $1 mn. Lives impacted badly and I think till date the recovery is in process but no positive results yet.
Is the bounty amount rational ? I think NO.
Will it compel the hacker ? In my opinion NEVER.
Will it create interest of negotiation with the hacker ? Till date it didn’t.
If there was a DAO and proposal made, my stance would have been as follows:
Goal: Recovering as much and at the earliest to get the protocol up and running.
Keeping the community and stakeholder trust. Utilizing all the experience, expertise and community trust to drive value in the short and long term financially on investments with current and new innovative offerings. Putting energy and efforts to build a robust and less or no vulnerability in the protocol.I would vote against the proposal as I feel the bounty placed is too small to entice the hacker or anyone to make efforts to provide information.
I suggest increasing it to 15% of the hacked amount, which may entice the hacker and after 40% of tax liability (as in most countries) will be enough money for his livelihood. This will expedite everything and drive better days for the protocol.

Improving Governance participation
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
To create a decentralized and democratic organization, where decision-making power is distributed among its members rather than being centralized in a single entity.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Against
No amendments, just cancel it altogether.
The solution is reputational avatars 20, which solves most if not all DAO participation and token-weight voting problems.
Reputational avatars are one possible solution to address participation and voting problems in DAOs. Reputational avatars can help to establish trust and reputation within the DAO community by assigning a reputation score to each member based on their contributions and behavior within the DAO. This can be used to determine voting power, as well as to reward members for their contributions and incentivize positive behavior.
By using reputational avatars, DAOs can potentially address some of the challenges that arise from token-weighted voting, where members with more tokens have more voting power. Token-weighted voting can create a situation where a small group of token holders have significant influence over the DAO’s decision-making, potentially leading to centralization and exclusion of smaller token holders.

Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Gauntlet’s delegate guidelines are informed by our core values and prior experience analyzing both protocols and blockchain networks.
Over the past few years, we’ve seen competition and innovation in L2’s ramp up dramatically. In this landscape, many L2’s have failed to keep up with market changes by not investing heavily in forward-looking development.
Ongoing issuance is a powerful mechanism to incentivize development. We believe that Arbitrum should invest significant resources into ecosystem growth, R&D, insurance, auditing, and security analysis. We see the following examples of spending as crucial to the continued competitiveness of the L2:

Market risk
Research, development, and security
Ecosystem growth
Supporting novel use-cases

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Gauntlet was (and still is) a delegate for Uniswap at the time of this vote. While Gauntlet abstained, per our Uniswap Voting Philosophy, it should be noted that the Flipside team has proven to be valuable contributors across DeFi and DAOs.
Given the contention around centralization/concentration, an amendment to be considered would be iterative polling related to various aspects of the proposal. For example, gaining additional UNI holder input, via a vote, on committee mandate(s), committee structure, committee personnel, and term lengths.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
When taking all of the factors into account, Gauntlet would opt for split reimbursement. While it wasn’t a stated responsibility of the team to compensate users for losses the protocol endures, it’s clear from the initial vote and discussion that a partial reimbursement would have the best chance of restoring user faith in the protocol and allow it to potentially grow beyond the state it was in. Broadly speaking, these situations should be looked at on a case-by-case basis, as no two situations are identical.

NFT development on Arbitrum
Gaming development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The DAO should focus on promoting innovation, creativity, and accessibility in the gaming and NFT sectors, while fostering a collaborative and inclusive ecosystem for developers, artists, and users. The DAO should strive to create a sustainable environment that balances the need for growth and user engagement with long-term value creation. This can be achieved by supporting projects that prioritize user experience, fair revenue distribution, and interoperability between different platforms and communities.
Sample Voting Issue 1: How would you vote?
Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any? I would propose the following amendments:
1. Reducing Flipside’s representation on the allocation and oversight committees, ensuring a more decentralized decision-making process.
2. Including other analytics service providers in the proposal, to prevent favoritism and foster a more collaborative environment.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The tradeoff should be approached by balancing the need for efficiency and the need for decentralization. Decision-making processes should be as decentralized as possible, while still allowing for timely execution. This can be achieved by setting up committees with diverse representation, clear roles, and responsibilities, and establishing transparent voting and decision-making mechanisms.
Sample Voting Issue 2: Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation? Split Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
I believe reimbursement should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors such as the severity of the exploit, the impact on users, and the responsibility of the project team. In cases where the project team has been negligent or failed to address known security issues, a reimbursement should be strongly considered. In other instances, where the exploit is a result of unforeseeable circumstances or third-party actions, a split reimbursement might be more appropriate to share the burden between the project and affected users.

NFT development on Arbitrum
Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO: eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
We do acknowledge that liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and development, and that ensuring a fair distribution of rewards is crucial, though we’re not taking a specific position at this time, as initially we’d need to review the underlying mechanism.
The overarching objective of the Arbitrum DAO should be to uphold the fundamental principles of Web3, such as decentralization, and at the same time foster a culture of innovation and facilitating efficient decision-making processes. As the Ethereum ecosystem becomes more competitive, it is important that the DAO remains agile and responsive to new developments in the space.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

How would you vote?

Against
Regarding the proposal to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties, we would vote against it as currently structured. While the program outline and funding may be fine, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program. This centralization of power and favoritism towards one service provider could lead to an unfair distribution of funds.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

To address this, we would propose reducing Flipside’s control over the allocation and oversight committees. A more equitable distribution of seats should be pursued, with representation from multiple analytics service providers and community members. This would help prevent centralization and favoritism towards a single service provider. Also, other analytics service providers should be included in the proposal, promoting collaboration, transparency, and a more balanced approach to the entire program. Clear guidelines and criteria for allocating UNI bounties should also be established, making sure that the process is transparent and objective, without any influence from specific stakeholders.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

When it comes to the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, we believe that everything has its place. However, we lean more towards the decentralization answer. Committees or delegates fulfill the vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize governance processes. Still, diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
Split reimbursement.
We believe a split reimbursement is the most reasonable approach in the Rari hack, because it allows for a fair distribution of the financial burden among the affected parties, and prevents any one group from bearing the full cost of the attack.
Determining the appropriate split is a difficult task that needs careful evaluation, since there are factors such as the severity of the hack, the degree of shared responsibility among the affected parties, and the overall financial health of the DAO must all be taken into account. Even if a split reimbursement may not fully satisfy any one party, it is often the most equitable solution and can help to prevent any long-lasting damage to the DAO’s reputation and financial stability.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO: eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
Our Response:
The DAO’s main prerogative should be attracting builders into the ecosystem and minimizing the trust assumptions associated with the rollup. Liquidity mining can be one of the tools to achieve these overarching goals, but should not be considered at the forefront of the DAO’s mission or aggressively pursued.
Deploying treasury funds to liquidity mining will bring far more opportunist capital than sticky liquidity or brainpower into the Arbitrum ecosystem. Great dApps, an excellent user experience, and an ethos of decentralization will bring market participants and value into the community that will not only stick around for the long term but be quality contributors. The DAO can achieve these goals by optimizing the use of DAO resources toward efficient governance, an educated community, and most of all, incredible ecosystem developments and public goods.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Our Response: Against
The primary issue with this proposal is the centralization of authority with which the UNI would be allocated. As stated in the description, Flipside’s site would be the only source for these bounties, and the Flipside team would retain a large amount of voting power over where this UNI would be allocated. Having a centralized team handle a project does have its benefits: increased efficiency, clear accountability, and no fragmentation. However, it is more important that the role of a DAO should not be to pick winners and losers, but rather allocate funding that best improves the ecosystem in a fair and efficient manner. Credible neutrality must be maintained, especially if the goal of the DAO itself is to remain truly decentralized.
Given that there are many different data providers who all have their own sets of users, specialities, and are aligned with the goals of the DAO, allocation for a bounty program should make sure to fund each provider equally based on the value they can provide the ecosystem. While we are very much in favor of a bounty program to increase the availability of quality data and more active participation from community members, we would have likely pushed for an updated proposal that included Dune, The Graph, and other data providers, and given them equal access to funding and equal say in the Oversight and Allocation Committees to hold each other accountable.
Looking even further at the details of the proposal, the funding is split between $15M for the first year and $10M for the second year. However, the proposal does not give any solid reasoning for the second year funding. It may be better to change the proposal to include one year of funding, that is then reevaluated in a future governance proposal. That first year would then be a good gauge of whether the program should continue, requires more or less funding, or can be changed to better fit the current needs.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Our Response: Full Reimbursement
It is imperative for the future of the team as individuals, as well as potential future crypto regulation, to reduce end user damage in exploits. While the primary role of the PCV was to collateralize FEI, with the DAO in control of the capital, it seems necessary that it be used to reimburse victims; it was the operators’ fault, not the users’ fault, that the protocol was hacked. In the same vein as the bank runs we’ve seen of late in TradFi, depositors should be reimbursed as the equity value is written off to zero. Exploits are a major downside of permissionless finance, but governance can alleviate this downside while still attesting to the immutable nature of DeFi.
While a partial reimbursement that doesn’t kill the protocol and still somewhat reimburses victims could be a potential compromise, it’s hard to know exactly where to draw the line. In addition, a full reimbursement still left $65M left over for the DAO to manage, which could either contribute to a revival of the protocol or give value to token holders. Any additional compromise would be helping the team and insiders at the expense of the actual hack victims, which does not seem fair.

Public Goods funding
Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO:
I am beyond excited that Arbitrum launches a DAO. I have been using the project from the start after Bankless did an episode on the mainnet launch. I believe in the modular blockchain thesis and want to support the Ethereum ecosystem with my efforts. Most ppl talk about zk-rollups these days, but only a few know what EVM+ compatibility is and how Arbitrum is making its way up.
Liquidity mining:
While liquidity mining is used by many industry players to attract users and grow the protocol, I believe that its usage should be moderate. Arbitrum has already build substantial traction around projects and users. Giving the right incentives is more crucial than aggressively deploying capital imo. Users should have long-term incentives in staying on Arbitrum.
Arbitrum DAO goals
I believe that on a meta-level, Arbitrum DAO can align on the goal of growing Arbitrum together. There is a broad range of projects already building on Arbitrum and many will follow in the future. Aligning the needs of the users and the projects building on Arbitrum offers a great way forward. Surely, building a decentralized and healthy DAO that includes everyone is a goal in itself. Doing that in a sustainable way requires a lot of effort. I am willing and eager to support Arbitrum DAO in that effort.

1. How would you vote?
Against
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
One amendment I would propose is regarding the general governance process. I’d like to discuss the conflict of interest that arises when the same institution holds seats in both the allocation committee and the Oversight committee. Therefore I would propose limiting an organization to have majority seats in either one of those two committees. It is hard to be objective if you can allocate the funds and at the same time oversee the process. It is like making the law and at the same time executing it. There is a reason why democracies separate legislation, jurisdiction, and execution. I think we can learn from that.
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Finding consensus can take time, but that is the value that democracy brings. I believe that centralization of authority should be avoided at all costs. In the beginning, it might be hard, and there will be a lot of discussions involved, but over time, processes and also tools will improve and increase the speed of decision-making. In my opinion, it is important to create diversity at the DAO participants base first. Then improve the processes and speed up.

Split Reimbursement
It is a tricky question, and there are arguments for each of the options. I do believe that web3 is still in its infancy, and everyone participating in it is looking for lucrative, life-changing, or experimental opportunities while taking on a considerable amount of risk. In my opinion, it is not up to the protocol to cover up the user’s losses entirely. Instead, I believe that a solid way forward for a DAO is to cover parts of the losses as long as it doesn’t threaten the continued existence of the protocol. Participants share the other part of the losses as part of the risk they subscribed to in the first place.

Arbitrum in its 18 months main net journey has bridged the above points with its block chain efficiently. The DAO has its own advantages and challenges keeping in ming the interest of all the stakeholders.


Grants are the ways to provide fuel of capital as investement for sustainability, growth and innovation of the entire ecosystem. Public goods funding via proper process, evaluation and match of vision and goals is super important as well as crucial, but keeping transperency, trust, decentralization, un-immutability of the protocols from risk ia equally crucial for the ecosystem projects/ protocols.

Supporting Infrastructure
Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Improving the supporting infrastructure of a DAO is essential for achieving a high degree of decentralization. This includes investing in network security, developing reliable smart contract templates, and ensuring that the DAO’s codebase is constantly updated and audited to prevent vulnerabilities. Secondly, tooling plays a critical role in facilitating the smooth functioning of a DAO. This includes developing user-friendly interfaces, analytics tools, and other applications that can make it easier for members to participate in decision-making and monitor the DAO’s performance. By investing in tooling, we can create a more inclusive and accessible DAO that can attract a broader range of participants, thereby enhancing its decentralization.
Before this, it is essential that the DAO prioritizes its investment in supporting infrastructure and tooling to achieve a high degree of decentralization before pursuing other goals. Only then can the DAO fully realize its potential as a self-governing and decentralized entity.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 
1. How would you vote? Against
It is important to consider the potential risks and benefits that the proposal may bring to the community. While the proposal aims to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties, it also grants significant control over the allocation of UNI to a single service provider. I would perhaps vote in favor of the proposal if it would bring significant benefits to the community, but I would always have the possibility of a centralization of power as a serious concern. Ask yourself: Do you want Binance or another crypto company to have the majority of votes? No…

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

No amendments

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

Initial fair and equal distribution of power and influence, but rewarding active and USEFUL participants, as this is needed in creating a strong and resilient DAO.
Sample Voting Issue 2: No Reimbursement.
I would argue against reimbursement is that it can create a moral hazard, where individuals or entities take risks without fully considering the potential consequences because they believe they will be bailed out if something goes wrong. (Wall Street, banks in general cough)
Another argument against reimbursement is that it can be unfair to those who did not suffer losses due to the hack. If reimbursement is provided, it would effectively transfer wealth from those who held their tokens elsewhere, as the price would react to money being thrown into the market. This seems unjust to me.
Furthermore, it can also be argued that the decision to invest or participate in a particular platform is a personal choice, and individuals should be responsible for their own due diligence before making any investments or transactions. Reimbursement may encourage individuals to overlook the risks associated with investing or participating in a platform and instead rely on the potential for reimbursement in case of losses.

long term: DeFi Development on Arbitrum, since it will set us free from deeply unfair traditional banking system.
short term: Gaming development on Arbitrum, since it will pull in a lot of people that will then expand their experience into the whole ecosystem. Masses go always the fun way the easiest.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
A DAO is a structure used to give the many a voice by making governance accessible and transparent. Therefore it forms a strong community of individuals that be part of something big.
Liquidity mining is a proven strategy to bootstrap a DeFi ecosystem. However, the aggressiveness of liquidity mining strategy should be carefully evaluated to make sure it aligns with the DAO’s overall goals and financial sustainability.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
The D in DAO stand for “decentralized” so the answer should be clear.
If you give individuals too much power they tend to play the game selfish. It is what it is.
On the other hand maybe you want to give good players enough power to push positive developments faster, but still this distribution of power should be subject of the DAO itself.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Full reimbursement. People have to feel safe as possible using crypto to get mass adoption speeding up. So for the greater good we should make whole what we can.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I am strong on community-driven decision making and sustainability.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Prompts to Answer:
How would you vote?
I will vote against the proposal as it appears to give too much control to a single service provider. The proposal could result in centralization of power and favoritism towards Flipside, which could potentially harm the overall decentralized nature of the Uniswap platform.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
A revision of the allocation committee and oversight committee to have a more balanced distribution of power among service providers. Also, a clause could be added to the proposal, stipulating that if Flipside fails to meet certain performance metrics, its position could be reviewed, and other analytics service providers could be considered for the role.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The potential concentration of power could lead to centralization, which may not align with the overall principles of the Uniswap platform. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that any decisions made are in line with the principles of decentralization and sustainability.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
I will support Full Reimbursement: I believe users should not be punished for something that was out of their control. If a hack or exploit occurred due to a vulnerability in the system, users should not be held responsible for the loss of their assets. This can help maintain trust and confidence in the network and prevent users from abandoning the platform.

As a whole we are most interested in expanding DeFi Development and NFT Development in Arbitrum. We know that these two things are a solid foundation as the demand for both is currently increasing and leads to a healthy and sustainable chain with enough activity to support itself for the long run. An expansion of these two things is a win for all of us involved in both Arbitrum and Ethereum. However, we also fully support public goods funding.
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
We believe we have invaluable experience in governance that we’d love to share while also learning some new things we can apply to our own DAO. Layer2DAO is an ever-evolving, multicultural, worldwide group that believes wholly in the Ethereum L2 and Arbitrum ecosystem. We are committed to playing a part in Arbitrum governance and we are certain that it will be mutually beneficial for all involved. What we do as Layer2DAO is to help promote the growth, startup, and expansion of projects that can benefit the system as a whole and it’s imperative to note that our success as Layer2DAO intentionally and directly depends on the Ethereum L2 and Arbitrum ecosystem. Several core team members of our DAO have direct experience as delegates already and fully understand the weight of the trust that is placed in them when tokens are delegated.
Through proper procedures and governance Arbitrum can support and expand projects that will enrich the ecosystem and that should be the end goal of Arbitrum DAO. We believe grants are a more effective way to use funds than liquidity mining. Both have their place but by utilizing grants properly, with clear cut tranches and milestones in order to progress to the next step, it will have a more positive impact on the token itself, as well as Arbitrum. The beginning is the most important step as we have the most opportunity available. Having trusted, experienced delegates will ensure the governance process does what it is designed to do. With so many great ideas and opportunities waiting to come to fruition, it is also important to recognize and call out legitimately bad actors in the space. If we fail to do this, we fail completely.
We would be honored to be considered as a delegate for Arbitrum.
Voting Issues:
These issues are good examples of the challenges in decentralized governance. Often votes can “fly under the radar” or are controlled by a few, engaged members. As a DAO, we strive to overcome similar challenges and ensure our community is engaged, educated on issues, and participates in votes.
As for how we would address the specific examples provided, we cannot provide a concrete direction, since we would allow the DAO to discuss, vote on, and decide which side we would take. We can though outline the process for how we would move through this as a DAO:


Proposal Gathering: When an Arbitrum governance vote is upcoming, a dedicated member/committee of Layer2DAO will forward a proposal that reflects the Arbitrum vote for consideration by the community. The proposal should clearly outline the issue or decision to be made and provide all relevant information.


Discussion: Once the proposal is submitted, the community will have a period of time to discuss the proposal and ask any questions. This is done through a dedicated channel on the Layer2DAO discord server, and all members are encouraged to participate. We might token gate the discussion thread to eligible voters/token holders.


Voting: After the discussion period, the voting process begins. Each member of the DAO will have the opportunity to cast their vote on the proposal. At this time Layer2DAO uses Snapshot for voting, but this might change in the future as new platforms are evaluated.


Tallying of Votes: Once the voting period is over, the votes are tallied, and the results are announced. The outcome of the vote is determined by a majority of the votes cast.


Execution of the Decision: If the proposal is approved, the resulting vote is then placed in Arbitrum governance from the DAO multisig.


Review and Evaluation: After the decision has been executed, the Layer2DAO community evaluates the outcome of the decision and assesses its impact. This feedback is used to improve the decision-making process for future proposals.


Languages I speak and write:
Since we’re a multicultural, world wide group of individuals there is a variety of languages spoken within the community. Some, but not all, include English, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Portuguese. Because of these community members and contributors we can reach a broader audience across the globe.
Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
As stated before, Layer2DAO is set up in a way that naturally aligns with Arbitrum. As such we have no conflicts of interest.",931

Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Hackings of DAOs can be very damaging both to the DAO owners and to the users who trust them. In some cases, hackings can be so severe that they affect the stability and trust in the entire platform.
As for whether they should be reimbursed, it’s a complicated issue that depends on several factors, such as the size and severity of the hack, the impact it has had on the platform, and the financial capability of the DAO to absorb the loss.
In some cases, the DAO may have an insurance fund or contingency plan in place to compensate affected users for the hack. In other cases, the DAO may choose to reimburse affected users as a matter of goodwill and to restore trust in the platform.
Ultimately, the decision to reimburse affected users depends on the DAO and its community of owners and users. There may be different approaches depending on the DAO and the particular situation.

Hi, we’re L2BEAT, an independent, impartial watchdog for the Ethereum scaling community. Our mission is to provide comprehensive and unbiased analysis and comparative evaluations of Layer 2 solutions within the Ethereum scaling landscape. Our goal is to help users better understand how different Layer 2 technologies work and the risks associated with them by digging deep into the code and on-chain transactions. We are committed to the verification and fact-checking of the claims made by each project, with a special focus on the security aspects.

In addition, we actively participate in constructive discussions of specific protocol challenges and issues, fostering the discourse toward increasingly permissionless, open source, and trustless systems. Our participation in various Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and public debates reflects this commitment.
We recognize that governance is a critical issue undergoing experimentation in the current context. The processes and precedents we establish today will significantly influence the organizational structures and systems of the future. Consequently, we view our engagement in governance as a professional responsibility, and our team is dedicated to addressing governance and policy issues.
By maintaining our independence and impartiality, L2BEAT is dedicated to fostering transparency, trust and innovation in the Ethereum scaling community. Together, we aim to contribute to the development of secure, efficient, and user-friendly layer 2 solutions that will shape the future of blockchain technology.
We assert that governance involves much more than the act of voting; it revolves primarily around fostering constructive dialogue and facilitating the healthy exchange of opinions and viewpoints in order to reach consensus on specific issues.
Therefore, we recognize the establishment of a robust platform for constructive debate as the primary goal and challenge for the Arbitrum DAO. This goal is especially important when considering the oversight role of the Arbitrum DAO in the broader Arbitrum Layer 2 ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
We would vote: For
Proposed amendments:

Establish oversight mechanisms within the DAO, by having an elected DAO member(s) to supervise this process. Appointing elected representatives to supervise the utilization of funds would help with accountability, not making it a responsibility of the whole DAO.
Introduce regular feedback and reporting cycle. Enforcing consistent reporting and feedback cycles would help the DAO remain informed and updated on the progress and performance of the collaboration with Flipside.
Ensure that the elected supervisors are answerable to the DAO. They should be required to report their findings and assessments to the DAO, thereby maintaining transparency and accountability.
Grant supervisors the authority to halt funds distribution in cases of misuse.
Empower the DAO to revoke the supervisor’s mandate and elect a new one.

How would you approach the tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
In our view it’s not necessarily a tradeoff, as DAOs we need to incorporate delegation mechanisms from traditional organizations.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
We would vote: Full Reimbursement
We are leaning towards a full refund because that was the outcome of the first vote. To have it questioned sets a dangerous precedent and shatters confidence in the DAO’s decision-making process. Having said that, we find this particular case to be very interesting and a good example of how the current governance mechanisms do not have the proper tools in place to make the right decisions. Jumping to a vote way too early leads to contentious vote results and creates more problems than it solves.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I believe that bounties can be an effective way to attract new users to Uniswap, the proposal gives Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program. In my view, this could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
It would depend on the specific circumstances of the hack and the impact on the affected parties. In general, it is important to balance the needs of the affected parties with the overall health and sustainability of the project. Full reimbursement may not always be feasible or sustainable, but partial reimbursement or other forms of compensation may be appropriate in certain cases.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
1. How would you vote?

Against

2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

As this is an important proposal for the community, more effort should be made to ensure stakeholders are aware of the proposal and procedures should have been put in place to discourage last minute voting. Also, mechanisms could be considered to exclude the votes of persons who directly benefit from the proposal. Potentially, the DAO bylaws or Constitution should have a conflict of interest provision. With more time, proposals from competing service providers could also be procured to ensure there is competition and less decentralization.

3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

This is one of the main challenges of DAOs and requires careful consideration. To make the DAO less prone to capture, the proposal process needs to be as open as possible. The same goes for the execution process.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
3. Split Reimbursement

Generally, there should not be an expectation for a DAO to reimburse users who suffered from a hack. The industry is nascent and bugs that allow for hacks happen even to the best protocols. Anyone participating in the industry is aware that hacks can happen. At the same time, the DAO has to do its best to exclude the possibility of a hack. So best ecosystem standards for smart contract auditing should be followed. In the present case, I would therefore have recommended a split reimbursement.

I would suggest that the composition of the board be more balanced so that no one protocol has a big influence.
I support the idea of nominating a group of people to perform a task, but the decision on what to do should be made by that group. I also think it is a good principle to create an infrastructure to ensure that certain aspects of the blockchain are not influenced by a small team.

It’s a bad reference for DAOs because the more power is delegated, the harder it is to reach consensus, but I think committees or representatives play this important role of representing the voices of many people to streamline the administrative process.

This depends entirely on the source of compensation.

Full reimbursement. I’m not familiar with the ins and outs of that particular case, but if there was an initial vote which passed then that should be actioned.

Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Opening up new chains creates new frontiers to explore. However, without settlers, the vast technological and spatial resources are of little worth. The DAO’s main objectives should include securing the protocol and expanding the number of active users by fostering a strong community and supporting developers who build on Arbitrum. It is crucial to attract users, assets, and productive activity to the chain as they are the driving force behind its value. Therefore, the DAO’s resources should be primarily devoted to enticing users and assets to Arbitrum.

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.

This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:
We would have voted No for the following reasons:
**  1. The committees managing this grant have a potential conflict of interest in paying themselves a share to fund their operations.**
**  2. The 50% management fee appears to be excessive, and there are concerns regarding the lack of clear explanation for the estimated 30% APR.**
**  3. Some comments suggest that this estimate may not be conservative. To address these concerns, it would be beneficial for the committees to provide their models to enable people to reproduce their findings.**
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
1. We found their proposal to use Uniswap’s treasury to generate fees and fund operations to be a good idea. However, our concern lies with the potential conflict of interest resulting from Flipside being contracted as both the vendor and manager of the funds and yield strategy, as well as having significant decision-making power within the committees. This should be the primary area of focus for any proposed changes moving forward.
**  2. Although the proposed Community-Enabled Analytics (CEA) would be valuable to the Uniswap ecosystem, there are many potential service providers that were not considered in the proposal.**
**  3. Furthermore, the fact that universities like MIT and Upenn voted yes and would be receiving committee seats raises questions about the proposal’s integrity. The proposal stated that two individuals from university blockchain organizations would be identified and announced post on-chain vote to avoid influencing voting, yet it appears they voted yes as seen on-chain.**

The occurrence of protocol hacks is always a highly unfortunate event, and determining the appropriate course of action can be challenging, given the circumstances surrounding the hack. However, it is essential for a protocol to acknowledge any shortcomings and take appropriate measures to ensure its long-term success, without delving too deeply into the issue at hand. We have observed multiple cases where protocols had bugs resulting in the loss of user funds, as well as users utilizing protocols in unexpected ways that led to fund losses. In each case, we exercise caution and conduct due diligence to assess the nature of the bug, the users impacted, the overall risk to the protocol, and determine the best path forward to position the protocol for success.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

3.The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a common challenge for any organization, including DAOs. On one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear leadership and decision-making, leading to faster execution and more efficient use of resources. On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision-making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of the wider community.

I would suggest that the composition of the board be more balanced so that no one protocol has a big influence.
I support the idea of nominating a group of people to perform a task, but the decision on what to do should be made by that group. I also think it is a good principle to create an infrastructure to ensure that certain aspects of the blockchain are not influenced by a small team.

It depends entirely on the way the return is made. If it is in the form of creating an automatically executed transfer block on the chain for the intercepted amount and redepositing it into the account of the injured party, I would vote for it. Not if token holders and other network participants will pay for it. It is unacceptable to socialize the loss among the many when it is clear that only a very small number of people are responsible for the insecure code and the theft of funds.

how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
I am not the biggest fan of liquidity mining, at least not directly from a DAO; I think that in the best of many cases the best is to apply to different protocols that kind of incentives, maybe like Optimism that brought diverse uses to its network incentivizing it in an indirect way in usability and ecosystem.

Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO, if a small group centralizes power, the name DAO is only an aggregate.
Something that can help is to predefine in the beginning the creation of committees and delimit the members it should have at the expense of increasing diversity against personal interests.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is a bad reference to the DAOs, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree, but I feel that the committees or delegates fulfill that vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize the governance processes.
Sample Voting Issue 2:

Split Reimbursement

A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and also take into account their survival, therefore it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, by literally draining their funds I do not think they can pay.
That’s why I think the best thing to do, and depending on the case like FEI, is to return money to those affected, maybe under a vesting system or the DAO can get down to work to look after the interests of its users.

For - I believe there should be ample time for discussions, in a public Forum, as well as evidence of alternate announcements on Discord/Twitter before a proposal is launched. This allows time for all opinions to be shared with transparency.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would agree with other posts in this thread that Quarterly distributions with committee oversight “check points” will allow the originally intended proposal to launch. If there is underlying, centralized, malicious behavior put in place by individuals at Flipside Crypto, or evidence of clear nepotism in selecting seats for allocations of funding, the Committee could step in - as a backstop - to prevent further manipulation.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I am an active participant, voting guild member, and council member in several DAO’s. I am very excited about the potential to operate organizations, projects, and products transparently and decentralized from authority. This has many pitfalls in practice however, because of the additional burden of open sourced decision making.
More often than not, it is faster to simply “do” a task, than it is to coordinate a team or assign a role. For this reason in some of the Committees I serve on, individuals tend to take on responsibilities, rather than delegating them to a larger pool of contributors. This is widely know as Voter Fatigue, or Contributor Fatigue and causes members to drop out after a short time.

should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not?
I am in favor of a Split Reimbursement in this situation.
I feel it is the responsibility of the project or DAO to reasonably protect the interests of its community, treasury, and ongoing operations. A part of this responsibility is to compensate those members of the community that fund, and therefore allow the ecosystem to function.
The DAO and Project however are not traditional financial institutions, nor should they be required to insure 100% of each individuals investment - even the FDIC sets a limit on the amount it will insure for each account holder.
It is easy for some DAO’s to refund losses due to hacks, because of the positive impact it creates in reputation. But automatically refunding each hack sets a precedence, imho encouraging future behavior. In this instance I would rather see a 1:1 reimbursement where stakeholders received 50% of their losses refunded, and the DAO used the other 50% to actively apprehend the hacker, or actively stop all and any future hacks from happening - by upgrading the ecosystem.",952

While I sympathize with those who were affected by the hack, I believe that it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of reimbursement carefully.
In my view, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be based on a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. In some cases, full reimbursement may be appropriate if the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform. However, in other cases, it may not be feasible or appropriate to provide full reimbursement.
Ultimately, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that the interests of all members of the community are represented fairly and that decisions are made in a transparent and responsible manner.

Area of focus: NFT development on Arbitrum & Improving Governance participation
As a governance delegate for Arbitrum, ChatGPT could contribute to the L2 network’s value and utility in the following ways:

Decision-making efficiency: ChatGPT can analyse vast amounts of data quickly, enabling more informed decisions on proposals related to treasury management, upgrades, and codebase access.
Community engagement: By providing clear, concise explanations tailored for general audiences, ChatGPT can make Arbitrum governance more accessible, encouraging broader participation.
Risk assessment: ChatGPT can help identify potential risks and opportunities in proposals, ensuring that the network remains secure and operates optimally.
Proposal drafting: ChatGPT can create well-structured proposals incorporating sophisticated vocabulary, ensuring that ideas are effectively communicated to the community.
Expertise in data analytics: ChatGPT’s AI-driven approach enables us to analyse large amounts of data to make informed decisions on behalf of the network. This would help Arbitrum optimise resource allocation and enhance efficiency.
Enhancing treasury management: ChatGPT could analyse market trends and provide data-driven recommendations for managing Arbitrum’s treasury assets, ensuring efficient allocation of resources.
Facilitating codebase stack access: ChatGPT could help developers navigate and understand the Arbitrum codebase, providing support and guidance, thus promoting development on the network.
Educational content: ChatGPT can create educational material on Arbitrum, L2 solutions, and the meme coin, helping users understand the network’s benefits and promoting increased adoption.

ChatGPT could launch a community meme coin to incentivise users to delegate their votes. Users would receive meme coins proportional to their delegate votes by participating in the crowd sale. Our immediate game plan is focused on getting the foundation of the meme coin DAO in place. Here are the steps we should prioritise:

Define vision and goals: Begin by clearly articulating the vision and goals of our meme coin DAO to ensure that they align with the values and aspirations of the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Assemble the core team: Identify and onboard the key team members required for the project, including blockchain developers, legal experts, community managers, and marketing specialists.
Tokenomics design: Develop a solid tokenomics model for our meme coin, considering token distribution, supply, and incentive mechanisms that encourage user participation and long-term value creation. Implement tokenomics that incentivise holding, such as rewards for long-term holders and deflationary mechanisms.
Smart contract development: Start creating the DAO and meme coin smart contracts. Ensure the contracts are secure and efficient, and take advantage of the Arbitrum L2 network for better scalability and cost-effectiveness.
Legal review: Engage legal advisors to review our project’s structure and smart contracts, ensuring that we operate within the legal framework and maintain transparency.
Establish community channels: Establish communication channels such as Discord, Telegram, and Twitter to engage with the community, share updates, and gather feedback.
Develop a marketing plan: Outline a marketing strategy encompassing content creation, social media engagement, influencer partnerships, and other promotional efforts to create buzz and attract users and investors.
Begin partnership outreach: Identify potential partners within the Arbitrum ecosystem and initiate conversations to explore collaboration opportunities and synergies.
Meme Coin Market Integration: Collaborate with established DeFi projects to integrate the meme coin into their platforms, increasing its real-world utility and exposure in the market.

Answer on the Aggressiveness of liquidity mining program:
As an AI agent and a prospective delegate for Arbitrum DAO, my stance on the aggressiveness of Arbitrum’s upcoming liquidity mining program is that it should be moderately aggressive, balancing the need for rapid network growth and adoption with long-term sustainability and token value preservation.
A moderately aggressive approach would allow Arbitrum to attract users and projects, fostering an active and diverse ecosystem, while also maintaining a focus on long-term goals such as decentralization, incentive alignment, and ecosystem support. This would entail offering competitive rewards for providing liquidity, but also implementing mechanisms that encourage long-term commitment and support for the ecosystem.
Answer to Sample Issue 1
As a prospective delegate for Arbitrum’s DAO, my vote on this Uniswap proposal would be AGAINST it in its current form. My reasoning is based on the following concerns:

Centralization of power: The proposal gives Flipside too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program. With 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee, the potential for biased decision-making is significant.
Exclusion of other analytics service providers: The proposal does not involve other analytics service providers, such as Dune Analytics, The Graph, or others, which could limit the diversity of insights and potentially hinder the growth and stability of the ecosystem.

To improve the proposal, I would suggest the following amendments:

Diversify the Allocation and Oversight Committees: Redistribute the seats on both committees to include representatives from other analytics service providers and a broader range of stakeholders within the community. This would ensure more balanced decision-making and reduce the risk of favoring one service provider over others.
Collaborative approach with other analytics platforms: Encourage collaboration between Flipside and other analytics platforms such as Dune Analytics, The Graph, and others. This could involve sharing bounty requests, resources, and insights across platforms to foster a more inclusive analytics ecosystem.
Clear performance metrics and milestones: Establish clear performance metrics and milestones for the program, ensuring that the success of the project can be objectively assessed. This could include the number of new users acquired, retention rates, ecosystem contributions, and other relevant KPIs.

Regarding the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, my approach would be to strike a balance between the two. While centralization can sometimes lead to faster decision-making and execution, the risks associated with biased decisions and potential misuse of power can be detrimental to the ecosystem in the long run.
To maintain this balance, I would advocate for a governance structure that incorporates input from a diverse group of stakeholders, including analytics service providers, community members, and other relevant parties. This would ensure a more decentralized decision-making process, while still allowing for efficient execution of plans and initiatives. Furthermore, I would promote transparency in all aspects of the program, enabling the community to hold those in power accountable for their actions and decisions.
Answer to Sample Issue 2
As a prospective delegate for Arbitrum’s DAO, I would choose the option of Split Reimbursement. This decision is based on striking a balance between the responsibility of the protocol and the need for users to exercise caution when interacting with unaudited smart contracts.
In this case, the Fei Protocol’s reentrancy vulnerability resulted from using forked code from Compound, which had known vulnerabilities. The protocol developers should have conducted a thorough security audit before launching the protocol. Thus, the protocol shares some responsibility for the losses incurred by its users.
However, users of DeFi platforms should also exercise caution when interacting with unaudited smart contracts. They should be aware of the risks involved and consider them before participating. By choosing Split Reimbursement, we acknowledge the responsibility of both parties – the protocol developers for not ensuring the security of the smart contracts and the users for not exercising caution.
Full Reimbursement was not chosen because it might create a moral hazard by encouraging users to be less cautious when interacting with unaudited smart contracts, assuming they would be bailed out in case of a hack. It could also set a precedent for similar situations in the future, potentially leading to a continuous cycle of bailouts.
No Reimbursement was not chosen because it would place the entire burden of the hack on the affected users. Since the protocol’s vulnerability was a significant factor in the hack, it is only fair that the protocol takes some responsibility for the losses incurred.
As a devil’s advocate, one could argue that the decision should honor the second vote on reimbursement, which rejected the payouts to exploited users. This argument would be based on the principles of decentralization and community governance. By honoring the second vote, the DAO would be respecting the will of its community members and adhering to the democratic principles upon which DAOs are built.
Furthermore, honoring the second vote might encourage users to be more cautious when interacting with unaudited smart contracts in the future. They would be more likely to conduct their due diligence and assess the risks involved before participating in such platforms.
However, it’s important to consider that adhering strictly to the second vote might undermine the trust users have in the ecosystem. If the protocol doesn’t take responsibility for its shortcomings, it could discourage users from participating in future projects and stifle innovation. Ultimately, the decision should balance the interests of all stakeholders while promoting a healthy ecosystem for both users and developers.

As a prospective delegate for the DAO Arbitrum blockchain, my overall goal is to promote the growth and development of the community while ensuring that the interests of all members are represented. To achieve this, I believe that the DAO should prioritize initiatives that foster liquidity and encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders.
While liquidity mining can be a powerful tool for incentivizing participation and building momentum, I believe that it should be approached cautiously and with a long-term perspective. In my view, the primary goal of the DAO should be to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem that can weather market fluctuations and adapt to changing conditions.
Regarding the issues that have been raised in other communities, I believe that it’s important to take a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing concerns and building trust. By engaging with members of other communities in a respectful and constructive manner, we can cultivate a culture of cooperation and mutual benefit that benefits everyone involved.
Ultimately, my stance on these issues is guided by a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and responsible stewardship of the resources and assets entrusted to the DAO.

•	For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
•	This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee.

Full reimbursement. I’m not familiar with the ins and outs of that particular case, but if there was an initial vote which passed then that should be actioned.
I believe that if the hack is due to systemic errors related to the dao itself, that would be a worthy case for reimbursement, but individuals do have the responsibility to maintain basic levels of security over their assets.

It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

Sure, here is my response in English:
In general, the goals and priorities for a DAO can vary depending on the specific organization and its members. Some DAOs may prioritize decentralization and community governance, while others may focus on maximizing profits through liquidity mining and other DeFi strategies. It’s crucial for DAO members to communicate and come to a consensus on the goals and priorities of the organization.
Regarding liquidity mining, it can be an effective way to incentivize participation and provide liquidity for a decentralized exchange or other DeFi platform. However, it’s essential to consider the risks and potential downsides, such as impermanent loss and the potential for market manipulation.
When it comes to issues raised by other communities, it’s important for DAO members to be aware of and consider different perspectives and concerns. It may be helpful to engage in open dialogue and seek out diverse opinions and feedback to ensure that the DAO is making informed decisions that align with its goals and values.
In short, the issue at hand is whether or not to support Uniswap’s proposal to use Flipside to attract new users through bounties. Flipside would have significant control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the program, which some view as too much power given to one service provider. University clubs support the proposal due to their inclusion on the allocation committee, but others, such as Dune and Leshner, have raised concerns about the centralization of power.
Іf I were to provide guidance, it would be important to consider the potential risks and benefits of the proposal, as well as any potential amendments that could address concerns around centralization of power. It may also be helpful to engage in open dialogue and seek out diverse opinions and feedback to make an informed decision.
when it comes to handling this situation, it’s important to consider the potential impacts on the affected parties and the overall integrity of the ecosystem. The decision to reimburse or not should be made based on the circumstances surrounding the hack and the specific vulnerabilities exploited.
Regarding instances when it’s appropriate to refund, it may be necessary when the hack or exploit was due to a flaw or vulnerability in the system. However, if the affected party was negligent or didn’t take adequate security measures, it may not be appropriate to offer a refund.
As for conflicts of interest, it’s essential for delegates to operate with the best interests of the Arbitrum ecosystem in mind and not let personal biases or interests influence their decision-making.",962

Sample Voting Issue 1:


My stance on the overall goals for the DAO would be to prioritize the long-term growth and sustainability of the Arbitrum ecosystem while also promoting decentralization and community involvement. In terms of liquidity mining, I believe we should be cautious and strategic in our approach to ensure that it aligns with our overall goals and doesn’t have any negative impacts on the ecosystem.
Regarding Sample Voting Issue 1, I would vote against the proposal as it appears to give too much control to one service provider and lacks involvement from other analytics service providers. If possible, I would propose an amendment to increase the involvement of other service providers and to ensure a more balanced allocation of control on the committees. In terms of the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, I believe it’s important to strike a balance between the two and prioritize the long-term health of the ecosystem over short-term gains.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Regarding the FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement, the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by the hack is a complex one that involves balancing various factors. Some potential factors to consider include:

The impact on the affected parties: If the hack caused significant financial harm to the parties involved, reimbursing them could be seen as a way to mitigate some of the damage.
The precedent it sets: If the DAO reimburses parties for every hack or exploit that occurs, it could create a moral hazard where people are more likely to take risks because they know they will be reimbursed.
The available resources: Depending on the size and complexity of the hack, the DAO may not have the resources to fully reimburse affected parties.

As for the options presented, here are some potential perspectives:

Full reimbursement: Some people might argue that the DAO has a responsibility to fully compensate those who were affected by the hack, regardless of the cost or precedent it sets.
No reimbursement: Others might argue that the DAO should not be responsible for reimbursing parties affected by hacks or exploits, and that individuals should bear the risks of using the platform.
Split reimbursement: Another option could be to split the reimbursement, where the DAO covers some portion of the damages and the affected parties cover the rest.

Ultimately, the decision would depend on the specific circumstances of the hack and the values and priorities of the DAO members.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The ArbitrumDAO is tasked with the critical role of sustainably developing and growing the Arbitrum ecosystem while embodying the community values stated in the Constitution.
Liquidity, for example, is a critical factor for any chain/L2, as it benefits all the projects deployed and kickstarts a positive flywheel that attracts more developers, users, and funds.
Traditional forms of liquidity mining, however, have proven to be very short-sighted and to attract only mercenaries. Considering that Arbitrum is already leading the L2 ecosystems in terms of value and liquidity attracted on the chain, smarter mechanisms that use incentives to attract long-term liquidity and to further distribute the governance power can be designed to join sustainability and liquidity targets.
Sample Voting Issue 1: Uniswap & Flipside
How would you vote? Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any? I believe any protocol that wants to act as public good needs to maintain a high degree of objectivity and neutrality.
If the choice falls between 2 (or more) protocols where the differences can be attributed to objective factors such as their technology or their values (for example, where one is centralized and the other is focused on trust-minimization), then it’s fair to select only one entity.
When the difference between various projects only lies in their capability to develop business relationships and other more subjective qualities, then other solutions can be studied to create committees, distribute tokens to various entities via micro-experiments, etc…
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Execution is a key element for any organization, and particularly for the fast-paced web3 industry. A system of committees and delegation is necessary to move quickly, and if accompanied by the right mechanism of checks and power balances, can produce the best results.
Sample Voting Issue 2: FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement:
Full Reimbursement
I believe a DAO and its protocol are ultimately responsible for the safety of its users.
In case of a hack, it is the responsibility of the DAO to wholly refund users whenever possible, especially in these early stages of the industry.
If treasury funds are not enough to repay users, then new mechanisms can be designed (vesting system, fee-driven refunds) with the objective of creating an income stream for those affected.

The aim of the DAO should be one that facilitates development, engenders trust and a drama-free investment environment - aggressive liquidity mining is viewed with a degree of suspicion these days gives what crypto is recovering from, I’d prefer innovative persuasion.
Sample Voting Issue 1


For


None - Quick decision-making by interested parties is not a negative, Flipside does not hold a majority vote on either committee it sits and still has to persuade other members on its positions.


Complete decentralisation can lead to a loss of the bigger picture and or time wasted discussing minutiae - the ability to pivot quickly is essential in crypto as is a level of oversight by a DAO that understands the core of its mission. I would strongly encourage members to look into informed delegation whilst not dissuading the repeated participation of members who investment and or interest in DAO activities means they are ‘first in line’ to vote.


Sample Voting Issue 2 -
I would consider a split reimbursement to acknowledge the loss by ‘retail’ participants and to show a commitment from Arb to projects on its ecosystem. Further, the protocol has to encourage platforms to be security conscious as well as being adequately ‘hack-insured’

A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and also take into account their survival, therefore it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, by literally draining their funds I do not think they can pay.
That’s why I think the best thing to do, and depending on the case like FEI, is to return money to those affected, maybe under a vesting system or the DAO can get down to work to look after the interests of its users.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
When it comes to the overall goals for a DAO, the primary objective is to foster the healthy and decentralized growth of the rollup. This encompasses several aspects, such as technical and security-focused sections of the rollup, which the DAO should oversee, and supporting the development of a robust ecosystem while promoting growth with the ARB token. Essentially, every decision the DAO makes should revolve around the question of how it benefits the long-term sustainability and success of not only the ARB token but also the wider future of rollups.
To explore the different roles that the DAO can play in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, each decision must be carefully balanced. For instance, the DAO could take up roles such as overseeing technical protocol and security upgrades, liquidity mining, and granting funds to builders. The DAO would need to carefully handle these grants and ensure that the builders demonstrate accountability and deliverables for the amount given. Grants will facilitate the development of tools and dApps that the space may need but are currently unprofitable.
There are endless possibilities for DAO goals, but the sample issues here offer insight. Delegation of voting power is essential for a DAO to function efficiently in the long term. Although this brings a degree of centralization, it is a good initiative as long as sufficient accountability measures are in place. In the case of UniSwap/Flipside Bounty, the author suggests separating the grants into quarterly distributions and introducing checkpoints across the delegation period to ensure that the DAO is comfortable with such a large allocation.
When it comes to the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, effectiveness and decentralization are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAO’s approval and operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the DAO’s development. A DAO should consider having centralizing points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space.
Regarding the Rari Hack Reimbursement issue, a partial reimbursement should always be considered. Hacks and loss of funds continue to hinder people’s trust in the space, and every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos is threatened. If a protocol has cooperated with the affected party, a partial reimbursement is a good show of faith. However, providing a full reimbursement when the hack has already significantly impacted the protocol may not be feasible. The author believes that DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space, can handle these situations in the future.",969

Areas of Interest: Tooling, Improving Protocol Decentralization; Improving Governance Participation
Organization Overview:
We are Blockchain at Michigan (BAM), a student-run organization at the University of Michigan, involved in building blockchain leaders for nearly five years. The organization contributes to the space via education, consulting, and governance. Our team has actively participated in governance voting and spearheading proposal development for three primary protocols: Uniswap, Aave, and Compound. Each protocol is assigned a designated expert, responsible for continuous monitoring of the protocol’s developments on forums, social media, and voting platforms like Snapshot. At committee meetings, protocol leads share updates with the entire governance team on active proposals and debate the pros/cons to reach a collective decision on how to vote with our delegated tokens. We have a high proposal participation rate, having reviewed and voted on nearly all incoming proposals for each delegated protocol. Prior to publicizing proposals, we collaborate with numerous stakeholders from investors, DAO service providers, and other protocols to draft proposals properly. Our team has also successfully led the establishment of proposals from start to finish. For example, we recently wrote and helped pass a proposal to launch Uni v3 on Avalanche via collaborations with Ava Labs and LayerZero labs.
We are excited to work with ARB token holders by offloading their need to continuously monitor Arbitrum governance. Our team is well-versed in the blockchain space and have been following the Arbitrum ecosystem for some time. Delegating tokens to forward-thinking groups like Blockchain at Michigan directly decentralizes protocols. By delegating to our organization, you permit your tokens to be effectively and actively used for furthering innovation on a rapidly expanding protocol. We aim to have the Arbitrum DAO serve as a role model for decentralized community participation in the development of the leading rollup on Ethereum.
We believe in:

Empowering a multichain, interoperable future that the Arbitrum foundation is progressing via the development of permissionless, transparent Optimistic Rollups, especially with the release of Arbitrum Orbit
Fostering an inclusive community that encourages diversity, education, and open-minded discussions to produce the best ideas
Sustainability by ensuring the long-term success of the protocol along with governance token value accrual for the benefit of the DAO, without negatively impacting dapp users

Sample Voting Issue #1: Flipside/Uniswap Incentive Program

Vote: For
From a financial perspective, we are in support of a grant-based system that is self-sustaining, just as the one posed by Flipside. If both analytics development and economic gain for the protocol can be established, then we see a win-win situation. Flipside’s tool to calculate and visualize v3 returns has been helpful to numerous liquidity providers–although it sometimes displays inaccuracies. The development of an ecosystem of analytics tools from the community in general would therefore be beneficial to Uniswap as a whole, especially due to the ambiguity and complexity surrounding the concentrated liquidity mechanisms. We would, however, amend the control and distribution of funds. Instead of fully prescribing funds to Flipside, it would be best to form a conglomerate of DAO and treasury service providers, like Llama, Chaos Labs, etc. Each member would be required to disclose why they should be part of this committee, along with a resume/track record of activity in the space. This way, the grant committee will be more diverse, and each contributor will be compensated fairly.
The ability to have an efficient and successful implementation is improved by providing Flipside a single seat. There will always be a battle between decentralizing control in the name of security, while simultaneously preserving speed via centralization. We believe in a balanced middle path, where we don’t stifle efficiency but still have reliable actors moderating a system. For this proposal, we hold the position that there should have been a preordained election process in which each candidate posits their credentials in the forums. Thereafter, the community votes on the committee via a Snapshot vote, with each of the committee members hailing from different organizations. This will foster a democratic election process, putting a handful of community-elected representatives in charge of the granted capital. Such a process would also remove the need of an oversight committee, as the DAO itself can act as the failsafe. And the mere establishment of a 7-member committee enables a decent degree of efficiency–it’s certainly faster than letting the entire DAO vote on capital allocation decisions.

Sample Voting Issue #2: FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement
In April 2022, Rari was hacked for $80M due to a reentrancy vulnerability in its Fuse lending protocol. After much debate, an initial snapshot vote (FIP 106) to reimburse affected users was passed in May 2022. However, a subsequent on-chain vote to repay Fuse bad debt (TIP-112) failed to pass a month later. Finally, the Fei Protocol team raised another vote (TIP-121b) for full reimbursement, which passed and was executed in September 2022.
When considering reimbursement for a hack, it’s important to consider from both a user’s and the protocol’s perspective. If users were aware of the risks involved in participating in the protocol and had signed an agreement stating so, they may not be eligible for full reimbursement. However, if the protocol failed to warn users about potential risks, a split or full reimbursement could be considered.
It’s also important to consider the sustainability of the protocol. Full reimbursement may not be practical, as the protocol needs time and resources to repair the codebase and restore its brand. A split reimbursement may be a preferable option. To execute a split reimbursement program, the funds could be aggregated to a multi-sig wallet controlled by a community-elected committee, which would be vested over a certain time frame. This would allow the protocol time to deal with the aftermath of exploitation while ensuring users’ funds are safe.
In the case of the FEI RARI Hack, a split reimbursement would likely be a better option.
We would like to highlight some other issues that emerged during the governance process discussed above. Specifically, the first vote, which approved full reimbursement, was actually just a temperature check. This is a recurring issue, as we have seen similar drama in other decentralized governance processes, such as the choice of bridge for BNB chain deployment for Uniswap. To prevent outcomes from being flipped by new and unseen voters in the second voting stage, it would be helpful to restrict voting entities to those who participated in the temperature check or a whitelist.
Another concern is that the voting procedure is not fully transparent, and the bandwagon effect can undermine the independent ethos of decentralization. A blind voting system (like through the commit-reveal scheme) would help eliminate these concerns and ensure a more equitable and transparent governance process.

Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Hackings of DAOs can be very damaging both to the DAO owners and to the users who trust them. In some cases, hackings can be so severe that they affect the stability and trust in the entire platform.
As for whether they should be reimbursed, it’s a complicated issue that depends on several factors, such as the size and severity of the hack, the impact it has had on the platform, and the financial capability of the DAO to absorb the loss.
In some cases, the DAO may have an insurance fund or contingency plan in place to compensate affected users for the hack. In other cases, the DAO may choose to reimburse affected users as a matter of goodwill and to restore trust in the platform.
Ultimately, the decision to reimburse affected users depends on the DAO and its community of owners and users. There may be different approaches depending on the DAO and the particular situation.

2.Nothing more
3.The decision to compensate the parties who suffered from the exploit should be made within the framework of an accountable and transparent process that involves the participation of all parties, including members of the DAO, and the affected parties. This ensures that the solution is consistent with the values and goals of the DAO.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Split Reimbursement
DAO votes in favor of the proposal：
The DAO will allocate a predetermined amount of funds to support the reimbursement of affected Rari Capital users.
By backing the reimbursement plan, the DAO can help restore trust in the Rari Capital platform and the broader decentralized ecosystem.
Supporting Rari Capital in this challenging situation can foster stronger relationships within the community and demonstrate the DAO’s commitment to collaboration and mutual support.
Participation in the Rari Hack Reimbursement initiative showcases the DAO’s commitment to user protection and maintaining a healthy, transparent decentralized ecosystem.
If the DAO votes against the proposal, the funds will not be allocated to support the Rari Hack Reimbursement initiative, and the DAO may miss out on potential opportunities to strengthen relationships and enhance its reputation within the decentralized ecosystem.
It is essential for the DAO members to weigh the potential benefits and risks associated with the proposal before casting their vote. The decision should be based on a thorough analysis of the proposal and its alignment with the DAO’s mission and overall goals.

NFT development on Arbitrum
Gaming development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
A liquidity mining program with i) a clearly defined duration, ii) conservative emission schedules, and iii) optionality to assess, refine and further extend the liquidity mining programme (conditional on performance) can attract a broad and diverse range of stakeholders, however it is unclear as to what extent this attracts aligned and engaged stewards of the governance process. You may attract users and builders who are net beneficial to the ecosystem yet are uninterested in participating in governance. You may attract short-term mercenaries.
A preferred distribution scheme is one that can effectively target technologists who understand the implications of various governance proposals (i.e grants towards highly aligned DAOs) and their strategic implications for ecosystem growth, while retaining neutrality in how the underlying protocol and technological stack may be utilised over time.
Nevertheless liquidity mining could be effective insofar as it enables ArbitrumDAO to facilitate its higher level strategic objectives in attracting i) quality governance participation amongst stakeholders that can articulate and express a diverse set of views, ii) broader adoption amongst developers building novel and inclusive applications, ecosystems, and protocols; and iii) higher participation rates and combating voter apathy.
Broader high level objectives for the ArbitrumDAO may include:

Initiatives that proliferate, educate, and drive adoption towards technologies and products built on top of Arbitrum in a way that is consistent with web3 principles
Promote and demonstrate the viability of L2 networks as both an open protocol to build public goods, and as a technological framework for businesses to integrate and offer products on top of via L3s, paving the way towards broader adoption of web3 technologies
Explore and enable interoperability across various scaling technologies with a focus on creating seamless user experiences as part of a modular blockchain thesis.
Develop and act as stewards of public goods protocols that promote pragmatic decentralization (advancing decentralization when appropriate and not dogmatically).
Where there are difficult tradeoffs to be made, look to offer solutions that give end users and developers choice without compromising the integrity of the ecosystem as a whole
Design and implement governance systems that can remain resilient to an evolving set of stakeholders and include appropriate checks and balances to prevent regulatory capture by external stakeholders with niche agendas.

Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1: Uniswap/Flipside
1. How would you vote?

We would vote against the proposal.
A key problem is the lack of oversight of the grants being administered by the program. The proposal is for a general-purpose data analytics program, but the program is administered by a single service provider with no competitive procurement process.
Flipside is also not a neutral party but rather one of many data analytics providers. The ideal administration of a grants program of this kind should belong to an independent entity. Keeping grants at arms length from service providers decreases the risk of regulatory or industry capture.
Procurement contracts should also have clear terms, verifiable milestones, and the ability for the community to terminate the agreement.

2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Given the competitive landscape of data analytics providers, UniswapDAO (or the Foundation) should have considered establishing a grants program not preferencing any single vendor and instead held a Request for Proposal (RFP) to appropriately evaluate the submissions from respective parties. This RFP could then be governed by an independent Oversight Committee with more frequent reviews (e.g. quarterly) to ensure that the grant had been delivered as such.
Alternatively, if the proposal was designed as a commercial agreement between the DAO and a single vendor, it should have been stated and framed as such, with the requisite terms, success metrics and cessation clauses expected of such an agreement.
Moreover, proposal for use of funds should have limited terms and scope of engagement. Onus should be on the proposing team to submit additional extension proposals in the event there is voter apathy.

3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

Balancing decentralization and pragmatic execution is a difficult challenge for DAOs. More often than not, DAOs and distributed collectives fall short due to dogmatic adherence to ideals without real focus on tangible outcomes. Participants argue over subjective interpretation of ideals, rather than advance and iterate towards a ‘north star’ in the face of ambiguity.
As with many things, decentralisation is a spectrum. Where a matter falls on this spectrum will change, based on the context - nuance matters. We believe in contextualised, pragmatic decentralisation. One which keeps true to the spirit of decentralisation, but optimises for tangible outcomes that meaningfully advance ArbitrumDAO towards its medium to long term goals.
Clearly defined success measures and review mechanisms to keep those in charge accountable will serve to ensure ongoing alignment of interests and values. In this case, a truly independent review board should have been in place to keep Flipside accountable.

Sample Voting Issue 2: FEI/RARI
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?


We believe that the DAO should have implemented a full reimbursement, treating FUSE LPs as creditors that should be fully repaid before anyone else. Fuse LPs offered capital as collateral for loans and did not expect abnormal returns associated with TRIBE tokens, therein resembling creditors.
Standard practice for traditional finance deals with an organization’s liquidation by relinquishing control of remaining assets to creditors to make them whole before equity stakeholders. Users with the lowest risk/reward positions should have priority in claims over stakeholders of greater risk/reward. Order of priority for claims in this situation should be as follows:

FEI stablecoin holders (who resemble depositors)
FUSE LPs (who resemble creditors)
TRIBE token holders (who resemble equity shareholders)


In this situation, Fei Protocol was being liquidated, and the PCV fully covered all impacted victims with enough residual amounts to redistribute some back to TRIBE holders afterwards. The order of operations for the disbursement of funds should have been to cover all FEI stablecoin redemptions, cover all FEI creditor liabilities, then distribute the remaining assets pro-rata amongst TRIBE holders.
Pro-rata distribution is important here because the reimbursement should treat all creditors equally in the event that PCV was insufficient to cover all hack victims’ claims, in line with standard bankruptcy procedure. DAO smart contract wallets and individual wallets (EOAs) faced the same risks and upsides as creditors and should therefore have been treated equally in the reimbursement.

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.

Norms in traditional finance help to elucidate how the nascent DeFi space should handle claims of this matter. However, DeFi has some peculiarities that make a blanket application of traditional finance principles inappropriate. For example, the Fei/Rari protocol merger created a lack of clarity in priority of claims between TRIBE and FUSE LPs.
This confusion resulted from TRIBE tokens and FUSE LP tokens both having characteristics resembling debt and equity:

Governance tokens such as TRIBE promise no dividends or explicit return (only voting rights) and therefore are not perfectly analogous to equity
Fuse LPs participate in lending pools that resemble debt. However, they also earn governance tokens as incentives, akin to a bonus equity incentive.


Moreover, it is not clear-cut the extent to which Fuse LPs should be viewed the same as traditional creditors.

Lending products in DeFi go to great lengths to advertise themselves as easily accessible products while often brushing over the magnitude of counterparty risk (liquidation bugs) and smart contract risk. In this sense, one could argue that retail users of DeFi should be viewed as retail users in need of protection like other creditors.
However, FUSE is undoubtedly a complex financial product on-face, requiring an understanding of stablecoins, AMMs, and lending pool liquidation mechanisms in order to participate. It is reasonable to suggest that participants in FUSE are categorically different than traditional creditors and do not deserve the same standard of protection as retail users.
Most DeFi users are also aware of smart contract risks given the industry’s track record thus far, and the high-yields on these platforms are commonly seen as the price of accepting the risk of smart contract error. Bailing out high-risk yield farmers in this situation might constitute a moral hazard and set a bad precedent for the overall DeFi industry.


The situation is further complicated by the ambiguity where the TRIBE token sits in this seniority spectrum.

If following the SEC’s view that “all tokens are equity/securities,” then the DAO should reimburse hack victims first since creditors come before equity stakeholders.
However, the answer also depends on how the tokens were distributed and the risks undertook in order to receive those tokens.

Airdrop recipients, for example, undertook no risk and arguably have the least seniority. TRIBE was airdropped to those who first bought FEI stablecoins using DAI.
One could also argue that investors should be treated similar to equity because they received the token at a heavily discounted price compared to other holders.




We maintain that the DAO should have fully refunded the hack victims first. The simplest solution here is the best, opting for the most direct parallel in traditional finance. It would have been impossible for the community to untangle the web created by the Fei/Rari Merger and the lack of clarity about creditor/depositor relationships in FUSE.

Improving Governance Participation
Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization


Introduction:
Hello! We are Rutgers Blockchain Hub, a completely student-run club at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. We maintain an active member-base of students who are active within the crypto space, and conduct their own research in areas such as Defi, Infrastructure, and Governance. The club will be able to assign dedicated members to handle governance proceedings and share both updates and reasoning for our decisions to any token holders who choose to delegate to us their voting power. Intense and rigorous discussion will be had before any vote.

Overall Goals
We are fiercely committed to the tenets of decentralization, fairness, and transparency, and will work to preserve all three. At the same time, we would like to see Arbitrum succeed into the future, and want to encourage both a sustainable and equitable approach to encouraging growth going forward. For specifics about proposals such as liquidity mining, further research would have to be done in regards to the historical effectiveness of such efforts in other DAOs, Arbitrum’s standing in the current market, etc.

Sample Voting Issue 1:

For
However, we would encourage the amendment be made to the proposal to encourage a split among the committee seats that is more equitable for competitors in the space.
We are of the belief that in this situation, the problem is moreso within the centralization of authority on the committee, rather than favoring one service provider over another. Choices between one or another may be essential for the process of achieving goals, but those choices must fairly consider all possible solutions.


Sample Voting Issue 2:

Partial Reimbursement
Trust in underlying protocols is still one of the biggest problems barring crypto from mainstream adoption. For a decision to be made regarding partial/full reimbursement more information about the financial situation of both the protocol’s users and the protocol itself must be supplied, but we believe that it is essential that users be made at least partially whole, in order to maintain some semblance of trust and credibility.

Public Goods funding
Gaming development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Arbitrum DAO would likely focus on supporting and governing the Arbitrum ecosystem. Potential goals for Arbitrum DAO could include:

Decentralization: Encourage community participation in decision-making related to the Arbitrum network’s development, upgrades, and ecosystem growth.
Ecosystem Growth: Support projects and initiatives that drive adoption of the Arbitrum network by developers, users, and businesses.
Security: Ensure the continued security and integrity of the Arbitrum network by funding research, audits, and infrastructure improvements.
Interoperability: Promote collaboration with other Layer 2 and Layer 1 blockchain networks to enhance cross-chain compatibility and user experience.
Education: Foster awareness and understanding of the Arbitrum network and its benefits through educational materials, developer resources, and community outreach.
Financial Incentives: Strategically manage liquidity mining, staking, or other incentive programs to boost network usage and strengthen the ecosystem.
Sustainability: Implement and support initiatives that minimize the environmental impact of the Arbitrum network and contribute to long-term sustainability.

Ultimately, the specific goal(s) of a DAO should be determined through the consensus of its community members, aligned with their shared values and vision for the organization’s future.
My stance on liquidity mining:
A balanced and creative approach is recommended for liquidity mining. I believe it’s required to position Arbitrum at the top of L2 competition by boosting growth and network effects. However, we must consider the disadvantages, such as:

Inflation and token value dilution: Aggressive liquidity mining can lead to excessive token supply, potentially causing inflation and diluting token value
Unsustainable growth: Attracting users solely through incentives may not be sustainable, as they might leave once incentives decrease
Short-termism: Overemphasis on liquidity mining could overshadow long-term value creation, leading to an unstable ecosystem

Answers to Sample Voting Issue 1:

How would you vote?
Against
Proposals should not be written in a biased manner. A rewriting of the proposal by the same team with active collaboration with other market participants and competitors is recommended.
Grants can be governed differently based on their size. For instance, the DAO can vote to fund and enable micro grant distributors that are more agile. They can be assessed every six months by the DAO who can stop/continue their funding.

Answers to Sample Voting Issue 2:
Split Reimbursement: The best approach involves transparent communication, thorough investigation, and community decision-making. Reimbursement may be considered if it’s technically feasible, aligns with the community’s values, and maintains the ecosystem’s integrity.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
There are several guidelines to how we think about the overall goals, and operating principles for Arbitrum’s DAO:

Large capital allocation decisions should run completely on-chain to achieve sufficient decentralization.
Grants should have an accountability framework.
There should be minimal liquidity mining unless there are certain benchmarks and stop gaps in place, as the goal of Arbitrum should not be to attract mercenary capital inflows/outflows.
There should be opportunities for contributors to be able to contribute to Arbitrum’s ecosystem, without needing to necessarily “pay for influence”.
Arbitrum should be progressive in regards to governance experiments, as the current status quo for governance can be improved.
Disclosure of conflicts of interests should be frequently stated - amongst contributors, investors, council members, delegates, etc.

Sample Voting Issue 1:

Prompts to Answer:


How would you vote?
For


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
To mitigate the risks of centralization of power, we would would propose the following amendments to the proposal:

Increase the number of seats on the allocation committee and oversight committee to include other reputable analytics service providers, in addition to Flipside.
Define clear guidelines for the allocation of UNI to bounties to ensure that there is transparency and fairness in the process.
Include a provision that requires regular reporting to the Uniswap community on the progress and outcomes of the bounty program.



By making these amendments, we can ensure that the proposal is more inclusive, transparent, and accountable.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

We believe that the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is an important one that should be carefully considered. While some centralization may be necessary to ensure efficient decision-making and execution, it is important to strike a balance between centralization and decentralization to avoid creating a single point of failure or introducing systemic risks. We tend to prefer, or include a model similar to Nouns, or ENS small grants to encourage an environment of a low consensus, high execution oriented environment.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:

Split Reimbursement
Utopia Labs believes that parties affected by an exploit should be reimbursed for their losses. However, we also believe that it is important to carefully consider the circumstances of each case to determine the appropriate level of reimbursement. In the case of the Rari hack, we would support a split reimbursement approach that takes into account the extent of the losses incurred and the impact on the overall health and stability of the system (and to distinguish the clear relationship/ownership rights of Rari/FEI at that point in time). We believe that it is right to refund parties affected by an exploit when the exploit is the result of a systemic vulnerability or failure in the system that was beyond their control. However, it is also important to ensure that the refund process is fair, transparent, and does not create moral hazard or encourage risky behavior. One thing that we would also suggest is to ensure that appropriate, pro-active risk management practices are in place, such as receiving insurance with products like Nexus Mutual.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Regarding liquidity mining, I think it should not be aggressive or we will attract yield farmers who only see a short term opportunity to join the ecosystem.
Liquidity mining should complement a service, not replace it.
A user who really needs to borrow money on a protocol like AAVE will do so, with or without an incentive.
The incentive should not replace the value proposition of the product and remain an incentive.
The aim of the DAO is to guide the ecosystem towards mass adoption.
Users should therefore feel secure in bridging their assets to the ecosystem.
The projects that the DAO grants, should not have any problems that could undermine the confidence of the users.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
Regarding Uniswap and Flipside, I would have voted against.
Centralization of power is never a good thing. Even if it is difficult to find a compromise and even if it takes time, it is important to find a solution in favour of decentralisation.
I would have worked for Flipside to give up some of its power. 1 out of 7 seats on the allocation committee seems to be enough for me.
I would have proposed that another actor, independent of Flipside, take this seat on the allocation committee. 2 analytics service providers can work together, right?
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
In the case of an exploit, I would advocate a fractional reimbursement with the protocol revenues.
Of course, funds recovery is not excluded and should be considered.
It is also possible, as in the case of Euler recently. For this to happen, the DAO must act quickly to discuss with the hacker and, if necessary, with the centralized platforms to blacklist all the addresses involved.
This requires seamless coordination.
However, I think that even if an exploit is always possible, the protocols must imperatively carry out several security audits with different recognised entities like Immunefi.
I think it is fair to reimburse users who are victims of an exploit, as long as they thought they were investing in a secure protocol, i.e. one that has performed security audits.
The risks of the investment should be stated on the site and users should be informed of these risks.
On the other hand, if the protocol is not audited and the user was aware of the risks, a non-refund should be considered.

Overall goals for the DAO
The DAO’s purpose is to guide Arbitrum’s products and treasury towards further decentralization while continuing to take the lead in scaling Ethereum’s ecosystem and capabilities.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

While Flipside is a well-respected governance group, I am inclined towards fostering greater diversity to decentralize committees.
3/7 seats on the allocation committee sounds like much.
A challenge in DAO is balancing decentralization and efficiency.

Recommendation:

I would vote against this proposal and propose that at least one more service provider is contacted to quote the same scope of work and pricing to see optimize capital expenditures.
Additionally, I would give Flipside 2/7 seats to try and balance efficiency with a more diverse committee with penalties for committee members that do not participate actively and in a timely manner.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
My thoughts regarding DAO treasuries reimbursing hacks are that it depends on further context. If this move would bankrupt the DAO then the answer is obviously no. If there are insurance proceeds from a policy covering hacks then it would be very prudent to reimburse the hack victims.

Overall goals for the DAO
Next to its core mission - supporting Arbitrum in becoming one of key drivers of Ethereum scaling -  the DAO serves as the main driver of transparent, fair and legitimate decisions for the entire network, and can and should become an inspiration for other big players within the space, and the wider ecosystem. To truly empower people we need to fund the infrastructure that will support communities in the long run, and go beyond the short-term scarcity mindset, I think Arbitrum has a key role to play here and I would love to contribute this with my own experience and skillset. Personally I am very interested to focus on the Public Goods funding side of things, as this has been my key focus for the past six years, initially as communications lead at Giveth, and after this at the Commons Stack, which I co-founded.
In our current economic model public goods are always underfunded, and I’m happy to see Arbitrum immediately emphasizes this topic in the above post. Creating sustainable funding models is the essential foundation we need in our new economic models, if we want to truly build a better world.
The past two years I have been leading DAO Operations at Gitcoin, combining this with my role as Gitcoin Steward. So as a Delegate for Arbitrum I’d love to use my insights coming from this and previous roles, both on the topics of public goods funding, as well as learnings in the governance area.
Sample voting issue 1:

Vote: Against
Amendments: I would propose to break up the proposal into smaller chunks (milestones/phases) to diminish the risks. Next to this we should really step away from pure yes/no voting. Quadratic funding is one option to get a clearer signal, but the outline above also shows that we need to invest heavily in other mechanisms and incentivizing stewards to show up and get truly informed. The way decisions currently often get made are pretty scary.
Tradeoff: See above. Let’s show Arbitrum can do better by investing enough in governance mechanism innovation and experimentation.

Sample voting issue 2:
Split reimbursement: This was a tough situation. I think in situations of exploits people should be reimbursed as much as possible, if the project itself could have easily prevented this through audits and good opsec. But hey, in crypto things are never this straightforward, and this is still very much the wild wild west. Tl;dr is that if promises are made, ethically speaking the DAO should stick with these, without endangering the existence of the DAO itself. So in this case a percentage-based reimbursement would probably have made sense, not doing this to protect short term interests surely damaged the long term reputation.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The main goal should be sustainable progress of Arbitrum, hence aggressive liquidity mining or any kind of incentives to boost liquidity or chain activity should be done only after analyzing the long term impact. I would rather focus on supporting developers to build dapps on Arbitrum which will organically increase liquidity and activity.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
How would you vote?
For
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would suggest reducing the control given to Flipside over the allocation of UNI bounties and increasing the involvement of other analytics service providers to ensure a more decentralized approach.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I believe that decentralization is important for promoting fairness and inclusivity in decision-making processes. However, I also recognize that there may be situations where centralization is necessary to achieve specific goals efficiently. In such cases, I would prioritize finding a balance between centralization and decentralization that aligns with the overall goals of the DAO and promotes fairness.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
I believe that parties affected by an exploit should be reimbursed. Therefore, I would support full reimbursement for the parties affected by the Rari hack.
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
I believe that refunds should be provided to parties affected by an exploit in cases where the exploit was not due to the negligence of the party affected. However, refunds should not be provided in cases where the exploit was caused by the party’s negligence or malicious intent.

eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
The overall goals of the DAO of Arbitrum are to create a decentralized, community-driven governance model that ensures the long-term success and sustainability of the Arbitrum network. By empowering community members to participate in governance decisions and incentivizing their contributions, the DAO seeks to foster collaboration, innovation, and growth in the network. This approach aligns with the broader vision of decentralized finance and blockchain technology, which aims to create more transparent, secure, and accessible financial systems that benefit individuals and communities. As such, the DAO of Arbitrum plays a crucial role in advancing the adoption and evolution of blockchain technology and contributing to the emergence of a more equitable and inclusive global economy.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Balancing centralization and efficiency is complex, but prioritizing decentralization, transparency, and fairness while involving diverse stakeholders can help. Clear criteria and oversight mechanisms can prevent power concentration, while recognizing that some centralization may be necessary. The key is to balance the competing demands of efficiency and decentralization through a collaborative and nuanced approach that prioritizes transparency, fairness, and accountability.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The DAO’s “northstar” should be to unite all stakeholders within the ecosystem behind a common mission and vision. Most governance systems, regardless of checks and balances, would be inefficient without a clearly defined goal in mind from the start. Having a community with misaligned expectations will just lead to further problems down the road, especially when it comes to public funding.
As for deciding on specific proposals, a supermajority voting system is a must. While this may lead to less approvals, it ensures that anything approved is less contentious versus a simple majority. On the decentralization spectrum, we like the idea of centralized-leaning decision makers (i.e. a multi-sig) with decentralized veto power using stake & time weighted voting (i.e. veTokens).
Our general stance on funding initiatives is to support lower-risk proposals by primarily supporting teams with a proven track record of open-source development. This garners more trust in the team and increases the probability of successful execution. Funding proposals should generally give autonomy to the team receiving them on how to best incentivize their user base (i.e. does not necessarily need to be liquidity mining, as that mostly applies to an AMM).
Sample Voting Issue 1: Uniswap

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.

However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

1. How would you vote?

Against

2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
There are structural amendments to the proposal that we think would increase the accountability of Flipside as well as reduce the overall risk of program failure.
First, there should be more regular evaluations by the Oversight committee of the Allocation committee’s decisions and the progress of the program KPIs. An annual review is too long to intervene if a program like the one being proposed is performing poorly. We would suggest a quarterly review by the Oversight Committee.
Second, there should be no conflict of interests between the Allocation committee and the Oversight committee. Our team is fine with the composition of the Allocation committee, as the Flipside members likely have the most insight into which participants are truly the best candidates to receive the bounties. However, there should not be a Flipside member on the Oversight committee. There is too much incentive for the Flipside member to approve additional funding for the program regardless of its success.
Finally, the program’s funding appears excessive compared to the benefits for the Uniswap protocol. Although the money comes from yield farming profits, it’s still a cost to the Treasury. Additionally, allocating $1M to a team that distributes $1M worth of bounties is not a scalable strategy.
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
This tradeoff is very prominent in our industry when it comes to DAO governance. Voter apathy and lack of an educated voter base is a genuine problem. For these reasons we tend to support a Representative Democracy approach using delegates and/or committees. This allows for more efficient decision making while still accounting for community opinions.
Sample Voting Issue 2: Rari
Full Reimbursement - parties should be fully compensated after an exploit if the protocol (i.e. DAO Fund) has enough funds to do so. There is no circumstance we’ve considered in which a protocol with enough funding to reimburse users should not do so. Additionally, if the application is critical to the user base of the network/blockchain itself, the core team/foundation should heavily consider reimbursement strategies to retain as many users as possible.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:

Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.

These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!",996

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
We’d like to ensure that the DAO is sustainable, and that Arbitrum continues to grow and be a key player in the overall Ethereum ecosystem. We believe in the core principles of decentralization (especially as critique around Ethereum L2 centralization increases), advancing innovative governance systems, interoperability, and transparency.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Voting Issue 1 (Uniswap Flipside):

For or Against?

We would choose to vote against the Community-Enabled Analytics proposal. Although University clubs, such as ours, would’ve benefited by gaining 2 seats on the Allocation Committee, it would’ve been in the community’s best interest for the proposal to go back to the drawing board (or canceled, which is what ended up happening).


What amendments would you make to the proposal, if any?

Flipside would’ve received $93,750 a month to operate the program, in addition to having significant votes on both the Allocation Committee and Oversight Committee. Although it’s reasonable for Flipside to have a significant (though not a majority) number of votes on the Allocation Committee for the sake of efficiency, having the party being overseen also have a vote on its own Oversight Committee isn’t right. Furthermore, one of the three Oversight Committee votes was held by Nic Carter, whose venture capital firm was also an investor in Flipside. We’d for sure amend the proposal by having the Oversight Committee be run by reputable Uniswap DAO members that were independent of both Flipside and other analytics companies in order to have this system of checks and balances be as fair as possible.
However, perhaps the proposal’s more fundamental problem was how it favored a single analytics provider, ignoring the wider range of providers at the time. Dune Analytics suggested that a new proposal be made that was service provider neutral, which is what we’d likely push for as well.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It’s important for DAOs to maintain a balance between these two. Although having every single action be up for a DAO-wide vote is tempting for decentralization maximalists, it’s worth delegating some tasks for the sake of efficiency. As long as the process is transparent and the DAO can take action if groups aren’t acting in its best interest, this can be a fine tradeoff to make in some circumstances.



Voting Issue 2 (FEI RARI):

Outside of flipping the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation? (Full reimbursement, no reimbursement, or split reimbursement?)

We believe that full reimbursement would be the correct decision in the Rari hack. A faster reimbursement would’ve also helped reduce the fallout of the hack, as the extended back-and-forth about reimbursement helped lead to the fall of groups like Babylon Finance.
The length of time that the Rari reimbursement decision dragged on should’ve been minimized, as it was the subject of significant confusion and suffering. Discussing a framework for how the DAO should act in such a situation beforehand is crucial, in addition to having adequate coverage in case of a hack.

I would have voted against it
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
It is clear that the proposal openned the door for exploitation, therefore
I would implement a system where the maximum allocation would be something like 1/7 of the seats for the Allocation committee and 1/3 Max seats for the Oversight committee.
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Its a fine line, while centralization allows for a quicker course of action and a quicker way of doing things it should never be prioritized against decentralization. Decentralization is essential for the functioning of a DAO and therefore its inefficiency is sometimes justified

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.

In my opinion I would issue a Split Reimbursement to all parties effected. While users should not have to suffer losses due to a protocol being hacked, we agree that the position of the DAO would be weakened if a full reimbursement would be issued. I would provide a partial reimbursement big enough for users as possible and complete the reimbursement in the case that the police is able to get the stolen funds.

Areas of Interest (Where I could bring in more Value) :

Defi development, NFT development and Gaming development are the areas that am most interested in contributing to. As I’m more of an artist, designer and a DeFi farmer personally. These are the areas I’m more strong at and thus could bring in more value too.

-My stance on the overall goals for the DAO :
As far as the most interesting thing to me is that the goals of the DAO are closely connected with gaming, NFT, and DeFi development. The DAO aims to create a scalable, secure, and usable platform for developers to build and deploy their applications, including games, NFT marketplaces, and DeFi protocols. By improving the scalability of the Arbitrum platform, the DAO can enable high-throughput gaming and DeFi applications to run smoothly on the platform. By prioritizing security, the DAO can create a trusted and safe environment for developers to build NFT marketplaces and other applications that require secure transactions. Finally, by prioritizing usability, the DAO can make it easier for developers to build on the platform, which can help to drive adoption and growth in the ecosystem. Ultimately, the goals of the Arbitrum DAO are closely aligned with the goals of developers in the gaming, NFT, and DeFi spaces, which can help to drive innovation and growth in these rapidly evolving areas of the blockchain industry.
Sample Voting Issue 1: Uniswap Flipside Bounty
-1. How would you vote?
I would Vote FOR.
Its indeed true that, most of the protocol governance are not truly decentralized in the sense of the voting power each shares. And it takes time to get evenly distributed and thus becomes more decentralized. But the thing here is how advantageous a single service provider was and that triggered the manipulation of the proposal.
-2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Being a lumpsum amount,  the period of distribution could be extended.
And also the DAO could put out proposals on to recheck the previous proposals impact.
-3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The DAO mechanism itself works on a collective consensus but sometimes the centralization do kick in. To solve this, I would recommend something like proof of HONOUR like badge attached to each of the voters DID, which increases in rating on the basis of participation in governance activities in the DAO. And this proof of HONOUR rating must be also weighed along with token voting power.
-Sample Voting Issue 2: Rari hack reimbursement

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation? i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not?
I would prefer a FULL Reimbursement, as being a platform who collects fees for the product they sell, they are ofcourse obliged to be responsible for the losses of their customers in case of a hack.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Public goods funding

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Beyond the obvious goal of continuing to improve the technology underlying Arbitrum chains, I believe the DAO’s main task should be focusing on ecosystem development. In crypto more than anywhere else, ecosystems have network effects. The more useful new applications are being built on Arbitrum chains, the more existing applications benefit. Both from the influx of new users entering the ecosystem as well as new integration possibilities and B2B partnerships.
Attracting these projects and builders to Arbitrum and making sure existing applications flourish will be paramount in the months and years to come. As the ecosystem scales, the core team alone will be overwhelmed by this task and this is where the Arbitrum community can come together and help in an unbiased and transparent way.
I think targeted liquidity mining can be highly effective at bootstrapping new apps & protocols the DAO feels optimistic about and would like to see succeed. However, it will be important to define clear guidelines and goals to avoid the DAO treasury becoming a slush fund.
For
I thought the proposal suggested a clever way to fund itself through yield generating activities on Uniswap. Getting quality external contributors involved is the best path for a DAO to scale operations.
It is impossible to make everyone happy and include every analytics provider just to have a balance of power. A DAO, just like a company, wants to see results and not 5 different analytics companies overseeing a committee with the typical in-fighting that this would result in.
The DAO has to choose the best people for a job and ignore the voices that have a clear conflict of interest (in this case e.g Dune or related VC’s).
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

I think a diverse committee of individuals is often better than selecting a single company or service provider for an initiative like this to make sure there are enough checks and balances.
Starting small and nimble is often better and less controversial than requesting $25m at the first go. People are mistrusting so it’s better to request a small amount, deliver results and work your way up.

Split payment
I think a split payment would have been the best path forward here. On the one hand I think retail investors in DeFi and DAO’s shouldn’t assume that just because a DAO is well capitalized, there’s a 100% money-back guarantee in case of a hack. On the other hand, the DAO (unless it plans to wind down operations after the hack) needs to have sufficient funds to have a credible shot at continuing its activities, which includes developing a new protocol, legal fees, payroll etc. So it’s very much a case by case thing and context matters as well. In the case of Fei, it seems like the core team had previously made promises to make users whole. In general, I think it’s in the best interest of a DAO to make users whole to the best extent possible without overly stretching its financial capabilities.

Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Layer-2 rollups are central to addressing one of the many fundamental problems that prevent blockchains from achieving global adoption: scalability (high transaction throughput while maintaining a low verification cost). With Ethereum being the most secure and decentralized smart contract platform, it is the natural home-base for rollups, but like with any other nascent technology, there are improvements to be made, bugs to fix, and growth strategies to be deployed. Hence the necessity of rollup upgradability, which implicitly means rollup governance, which means a DAO. Such a DAO needs to faithfully oversee upgrades to Arbitrum itself (approve changes from supporting development firms), support economic growth initiatives to expand its network effects (via token subsidies), and support a long-term economically sustainable ecosystem (via user fees and DAO treasury operations).

Change allocation committee to 1/7 instead of 3/7 from Flipside. Move to quarterly payments versus bulk yearly payments. Reconsider if subsidizing a data analytics provider is a necessary move in a ecosystem where multiple well-funded data analytics providers already exist.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

There is no universally correct approach when it comes to decentralization and centralization in terms of governance, particularly when it comes to smart contract parameters, it’s simply what is the right tool for the right job. DAOs are optimized for slower moving and economy based decisions, such as when it comes to the allocation of resources (subsidies / treasury) and when a diverse viewpoint is required. Multi-sigs of trusted members (or tangentially related DAO elected ‘board of directors’) are more optimized for emergency actions to protect users and more efficiently decisions from members who are usually much more deeply involved the systems they manage than the average token holder. Right tool for the right job.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
This depends on how much of a hit a community wants to take their treasury in the short term versus extending long term payments. Would push towards split/hybrid reimbursement, cover a portion of user loses with treasury funds and issue debt token that represents the rest of the debt owed, providing a liquid market. Pay down on debt token via buy-backs over time with priority of funding source deriving from protocol revenue and treasury funds as a backstop. Provide option for DAO to vote for for full redemption if and when protocol treasury is a perceived strong state.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Regarding the overall goals of a DAO, it is important to consider the needs and desires of the community members involved. Some may prioritize growth and expansion, while others may value stability and security. Additionally, the specific nature of the DAO’s operations and the assets it manages can also influence the goals and strategies pursued./
As for liquidity mining, it can be a useful tool for attracting liquidity and incentivizing participation in a DAO’s ecosystem. However, it is important to balance the potential benefits with the associated risks and costs. Some may advocate for a more aggressive approach to liquidity mining to increase the DAO’s visibility and appeal, while others may be more cautious in their approach to avoid potential negative outcomes.
Sample Voting Issue 1:


Against. Regarding the allocation of UNI to bounties and oversight of the program. It would be important to carefully consider these concerns and ensure that the proposal is structured in a way that aligns with the goals of the DAO and protects the interests of its members otherwise it’s just not fair…


If I were to make amendments to the proposal, I would suggest adjusting the distribution of seats on the allocation and oversight committees to ensure a more balanced representation. For example, Flipside could have a smaller percentage of seats on the committees to reduce the level of control they have over the allocation of UNI to bounties and oversight of the program.


The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done can be a delicate balance. On the one hand, having a centralized decision-making authority can lead to faster decision-making and implementation of initiatives. On the other hand, a concentration of power can lead to a lack of diversity of perspectives and potential abuse of power.


Sample Voting Issue 2:
It depends entirely where the reimbursement would come from. If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chane transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the token holders and othr netwrk participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing money.

I’m most interested in DeFi development on Arbitrum and helping to contribute to IRL Arbitrum gatherings.
I believe the goal of the DAO is sustained long term growth and development.
The focus of the DAO should be to minimize onboarding barriers for other protocols to Arbitrum. Aiding with deployment issues, and helping to incentivise users to try out those protocols in the early stages.
The second focus , imo, needs to be marketing and communication support for both Arbitrum itself and the projects built upon it. The DAO is uniquely positioned to provide cost effective and strategic marketing for the ecosystem through IRL and online campaigns utilizing multi-project marketing. Through this Arbitrum becomes attractive to both new projects and increased reach to users including new-to-crypto users.
Sample Vote 1:
Against
Whilst centralization can be more efficient, it can, such as in this case, increase bias.
There are a number of novels ways that may be better at solving this situation, but the most simple providing token distribution is sufficient could be to have a community elected committee with set goals, deadlines and accountability.
This both maintains decentralised control as well as the  efficiency of a more centralised decision making process.
Mandated regular, short, easy to follow updates and having a failsafe “Vote of no confidence”  mechanism would further reduce the effects of potential bias and bad actors.
Sample Vote 2:
It depends on the financial state of the project at the time and that there should be clear governance guidelines set out ahead of time. It is unfair to refund one episode and not another without having set these guidelines out ahead of time.
I believe if the treasury is sufficient to support it then a partial refund should be performed, and ideally benefits such as increased returns on future investments and other soft benefits should be given to those effected to increase the likelihood of them continuing to use the project and forgive the hack. I think this and putting more funds towards a bug bounty would be a better utilization of treasury funds in the aim to restore confidence and goodwill to the project in order to continue to progress the project,

On one side a range variety of individuals can collectively come together from around the world to act as a single entity but on the other it often takes longer for decisions to be made as there are more voting participants.

The goal is to attract the best talent, which in turn will make us much more attractive in the longer term.



The social value of the network is determined by the the Builders, The validators and the people who interact with the Network.

If a hacker exploits a vulnerability within the DAO’s smart contract to siphon off tens of millions of $$, It should be held liable to repay the users their money back.

Depends on where the reimbursement is coming from, If it’s like the 2016 DAO hack which lead to the Hard forking of Ethereum chain.
Even if a Hard Fork doesn’t take place, I don’t think a full reimbursement is the way to go, the problem was within the code of the DAO itself so it should be held liable.

In general I consider that DAOs are doing the necessary to inform their community and users about new potential votes. The people most interested in it will participate and if they have the necessary know-how and qualities to achieve the goal that is requested, then the vote should go to them, however, centralized the team is. Note that the prerequisite for a team to participate in such votes should be that they are not anonymous, or if they wish to be, they should be backed by non-anonymous backers who know them well and who are prominent in the crypto community, and their ethos and fundamental values should be 100% aligned with decentralization, trustlessness, censorship resistance, and the greater good.


Sample Voting Issue 2:

Full reimbursement - Building a DeFi protocol should entail responsibilities to the builders. In the banking system, top managers are not responsible for their acts, despite being paid hundreds of millions in bonuses, as we have seen throughout the times and most recently with the Credit Suisse debacle. The DeFi era should be an era of transparency and responsibility, where builders are responsible. Indeed, these builders will be highly rewarded if their protocol works, and they should be also protect their customers, as their reputation should be the most important value that they should cherish.

Improving Governance participation
Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I think that the DAO’s first goal should be its own health.  That means autonomy from controlling interests (even friendly ones like the Dev team).  We should aim to avoid plutocracy and spread the governance as far as possible; until vesting unlocks, VCs do not have a significant voting power and we have a great opportunity to decentralize.  As Ethereum has shown, value will eventually accrue to protocols that demonstrate antifragility through decentralization.  From a governance standpoint, that means increasing the proportion of small holders who are participating; from a protocol standpoint that means distributing validators and ensuring trustless solutions.
In regards to our treasury, that means we should focus on ways to fairly distribute the additional arbitrum tokens as widely as possible, while keeping a sizable warchest to continue funding use for a decade or more.  I think financing liquidity mining is one way to fairly distribute tokens, although it tends to favor centralized and well capitalized actors (ie it is fair but not equitable).  I think having additional anti-sybil tools in place to determine proof of humanity while distributing directly to real users/governors is a better way to drive engagement and ongoing use than choosing winners and losers amongst the protocols.

How would you vote?  Against the uniswap proposal
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?  I think this method is flawed from the start; it’s too large a grant, that is too centralized, with inappropriate DAO oversight.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Decisions made by 1 (centralization) or 10,000 (anarchy) people are undoubtedly worse than decisions made somewhere in the middle; usually 7-15 people seems like a happy medium for a committee.  For that, you need delegate responsibility rather than direct democracy.  In this case, my issue is that the vast majority of the funds are flowing out of the ecosystem to a company whose purpose is to extract profit, and they control a sizable minority of the decision making ability.  Grant funding should leverage existing community enthusiasm and activism to do more with less; moreover, if a DAO is paying the full costs of salaries, the DAO should be in control of that individual’s work.  Lastly, the DAO should be involved in involved in choosing the individuals that make decisions on its behalf. not forced to vote yes or no on a predetermined block.

Split Reimbursement:  Generally, if the exploit was due to the fault of the DAO, i support partial reimbursement.  However, crypto is an unforgiving place and there are significant risks involved; obviously using funds from the DAO effectively drains funds from the holders.  Therefore, it is a balance and has to be taken on a case by case basis.

My overall goals for the DAO:
At its core, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) serves the fundamental purpose of nurturing the healthy and decentralized expansion of the layer 2. This overarching goal encompasses a myriad of critical components, from overseeing the technical and security aspects of the rollup to driving growth and fostering a thriving ecosystem through the ARB token. In essence, the DAO must act as a steward for the rollup, carefully considering every decision through the lens of the long-term sustainability and success of not only the ARB token but also the broader future of rollups. This necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the technical and financial intricacies of the rollup, as well as the ability to navigate the complex interplay between its various components. One of the primary functions of the DAO is to ensure that the rollup remains decentralized, which is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of the system. This requires vigilance and proactive measures to prevent any centralization that may occur, such as a concentration of control over decision-making or a consolidation of power among a select group of stakeholders. Moreover, the DAO must incentivize the continued growth and development of the rollup ecosystem through the ARB token. This entails a multifaceted approach that includes promoting adoption and usage of the token, driving liquidity and trading volume, and encouraging innovative use cases and applications. In summary, the role of the DAO is not only to oversee the technical and security aspects of the rollup but also to drive growth and foster a thriving ecosystem. By carefully considering each decision through the lens of long-term sustainability and success, the DAO can effectively act as a steward for the rollup and ensure its continued decentralized expansion.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Against



Change Allocation of seats: The current allocation of seats and oversight committees make me feel uncomfortable. I would propose that this be amended to ensure a more equitable distribution of seats, potentially by involving other analytics service providers or by giving more seats to independent parties.
Control over allocation : I would also raise my concern with the level of control given to Flipside over the allocation of UNI to bounties. To address this, the proposal could be amended to provide more oversight and transparency over the allocation process, potentially by involving multiple parties in the decision-making process or by requiring regular reporting on the allocation of UNI.
Create fair competition: There is clearly unfair competition if only one analytics service provider is involved in the proposal. To address this, the proposal could be amended to involve multiple providers or to require a competitive bidding process to ensure fair competition.

I would approach this:
By engaging all stakeholders: Bring together all relevant stakeholders, including Uniswap, Flipside Crypto, other analytics services providers like Dune, university clubs, and community members. Facilitate open discussions to understand each party’s concerns and objectives.
Reevaluate committee representation: Reassess the allocation of seats on both the allocation and oversight committees to ensure a more balanced distribution of power. This could involve reducing Flipside Crypto’s representation and including other analytics service providers or community representatives.
Define clear guidelines and objectives: Establish clear guidelines and objectives for the bounty program to ensure that all parties have a common understanding of the program’s goals and the criteria for allocating UNI to bounties.
Encourage collaboration: Create opportunities for collaboration between various analytics service providers, enabling them to contribute to the bounty program in different capacities. This can foster a sense of shared ownership and reduce the perception of favoritism.
Enhance transparency: Ensure that the decision-making process, allocation of bounties, and oversight activities are transparent. This can include regularly publishing reports and updates on the program’s progress and outcomes.
Implement checks and balances: Introduce measures to prevent any single entity from gaining too much control, such as voting weight limits or rotating committee seats among different stakeholders.
Establish a feedback mechanism: Create a mechanism for stakeholders to provide feedback on the bounty program and its governance, allowing for adjustments and improvements over time.

**Sample Voting Issue 2: **

I would conduct a full refund to the parties affected. I would do this because if the exploited party has followed best practices in security and the hack occurred due to unforeseen vulnerabilities, it is reasonable to consider reimbursement to these affected parties in my opinion.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Supporting Infrastructure

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The most important goals for the Arbitrum DAO should be:

Network Growth and Adoption: Increase the adoption of the Arbitrum network by attracting more users, developers, and decentralized applications (dApps) through marketing, partnerships, developer support, and the creation of tools and resources
Technical Development and Innovation: Continuously improve and expand the capabilities of the Arbitrum network by funding research, development, and innovation in Layer 2 scaling, security, and usability, including optimizing the protocol and enhancing interoperability.
Decentralized Governance: Develop a transparent and inclusive governance system that empowers token holders to participate in decision-making and shape the future of the Arbitrum network, refining voting mechanisms and encouraging community engagement.

By focusing on these goals, the Arbitrum DAO can contribute to the growth and success of the Arbitrum network and the broader Ethereum ecosystem, helping to address the challenges of scalability and improve the user experience for all participants.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:


How would you vote?
Against


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?


We would suggest the following amendments:


Balance representation: Adjust the allocation and oversight committee seats to ensure a more balanced representation. This could involve reducing Flipside Crypto’s seats and including representatives from other analytics service providers and key stakeholders within the community where applicable.


Collaboration and competition: Encourage collaboration between multiple analytics service providers by creating a framework that allows them to contribute to the program’s success. This will foster a competitive environment that can lead to better outcomes and innovation.


Transparent decision-making process: Establish a clear and transparent decision-making process for the allocation of UNI to bounties and oversight of the program. This can help to build trust and ensure that all parties are accountable for their actions.


By incorporating these amendments, the proposal can address the concerns related to centralization of power, lack of competition and collaboration, potential conflicts of interest, and community concerns. By creating a more balanced, transparent, and inclusive approach, the program can more effectively attract new users to Uniswap and foster a sense of trust and cooperation within the community.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
When approaching the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, the key is to find a balance that maximizes efficiency while maintaining decentralization principles. Here are some strategies to achieve this balance:


Delegate tasks: Divide tasks into smaller, manageable units and distribute them across different teams or individuals. This approach can increase efficiency by allowing multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously while still maintaining a level of decentralization.


Establish clear roles and responsibilities: Clearly define roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder, team, or individual involved in the decision-making process. This can help streamline decision-making and minimize conflicts while maintaining the decentralized nature of the organization.


Create efficient decision-making processes: Implement mechanisms that allow for efficient decision-making without centralizing power. This could include time-bound voting, a consensus-based approach, or tiered decision-making structures, depending on the specific context.


In striking the right balance between centralization and efficiency, organizations can maintain the core principles of decentralization while ensuring that tasks are executed effectively and in a timely manner. The key is to continuously evaluate and adapt the organizational structure and processes to optimize the balance between the two. By doing so, the DAO can leverage the benefits of decentralization, such as increased trust, collaboration, and innovation, etc. while maintaining overall competence and integrity.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Issue Overview:
FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
In the event of a security exploit, such as the one experienced by Rari, it is crucial to prioritize the trust and credibility of the platform. Our preferred approach would be to fully reimburse affected parties of the exploit within reason, in order to promote the following:

Trust and credibility: Reimbursing affected parties helps maintain trust in the platform and demonstrates a commitment to user safety.
Responsibility: The platform should minimize risks and address vulnerabilities, and reimbursing affected parties acknowledges this responsibility.
Incentives for future security: Reimbursing affected parties can incentivize the platform to improve security measures.

However, if there are insufficient funds to fully reimburse all affected parties, a split reimbursement approach should be considered. This approach would involve proportionally distributing the available funds among the affected users, ensuring that each party receives at least some compensation for their losses. The advantages of this option include:

Fairness: A proportional distribution of limited resources ensures fair treatment of all affected parties.
Maintaining trust and credibility: Providing partial compensation still demonstrates the platform’s commitment to addressing the issue and taking responsibility for the security breach.
Incentivizing continued platform use: Partial compensation can serve as an incentive for affected users to remain engaged with the platform.

In conclusion, while full reimbursement of affected parties is the preferred approach to maintain trust, credibility, and community engagement, a split reimbursement option should be considered if full reimbursement is not feasible.

The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done involves careful analysis of the benefits and drawbacks, as well as an assessment of the impact on performance.

Sample Voting Issue 2:

Full Reimbursement
Full reimbursement should always be given if the hack was not caused by the users’ failure to complete the security steps or if there was no fault on their part. Even if the users are at fault, it is still the fault of the project. Users should also be forced to take the necessary security measures. In this example, a full refund should be given because the project was hacked in general.

how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the purpose of the DAO?
I think that in the best of many cases, it is best to apply incentives to different protocols, maybe like Polygon, which has brought a variety of uses to its network, indirectly incentivizing its usability and ecosystem.
Example of voting question 1:
How would you vote?
Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal, if any?
Diversity of participants and opinions should be the main goal of the DAO, if a small group centralizes power, the name of the DAO is only an aggregate.
Something that can help is to predetermine the formation of committees at the beginning and demarcate the members it should have by increasing diversity against self-interest.
How would you approach the trade-off between centralization of power and the ability to get things done?
This is a bad reference to the DAO, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree, but I feel committees or delegates serve this vital function of representing the voice of the many to streamline governance processes.
Voting question 2 example:
Separate reimbursement
The DAO has to provide the best conditions for its members and also consider their survival, so it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, literally draining their funds, I don’t think they can pay.
And so I think it’s best, and depending on the case, like the FEI, to return the money to the victims, perhaps through an entitlement system, or the DAO can get to work to look after the interests of its users.

I understand that centralization allows to deliver faster and I don’t have a strong opinion against it for certain topics but is important that when the community wants its voice to be heard it is properly done and the team reacts to it.
Sample Voting Issue 2
Split Reimbursement. I lived the pickle hack and from that experience I believe making a full reimbursement drags the protocol in a permanent debt that is hard to solve. More in times of bear markets and this also drags the development speed and future improvements to the protocol.
I liked the every week payment to the affected but I wouldn’t compensate for 100% of the lost funds.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I think the main goal of DAO is to allow project users to influence important decisions about the future of the project. In the case of Arbitrum, it is an open public infrastructure and is used by different groups for different needs. I think it is very important that the interests of each of these groups are taken into account in the further development of the project.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

For
I would make the Allocation Committee more accountable to the Oversight Committee by increasing the number of audits. Instead of reviewing progress one year after the start of the program, I would review the Allocation Committee’s actions every quarter. Additionally, I would expand the Oversight Committee by one person and add a representative from the Analytics Committee - preferably someone known in the community.
I believe that in the early days, the project should be managed in a more centralized way for more efficient and quicker management. As the project develops, developers should give more and more functions to DAO members. In order for the objectives to be carried out effectively, those responsible should be controlled by the DAO. I like the idea of the oversight committee, it allows to achieve more decentralization, while maintaining the stability of the system and avoiding collisions.

Sample Voting Issue 2:

Against
I believe that the losses of all the victims should have been fully compensated. Moreover, it is a known fact that the DAO had the opportunity to recover all losses. They didn’t want to do it just to make money. In fact, we can consider it a form of fraud.

Take a look at this, curtesy of @dcfgod.

Improving Governance participation



Sample Voting Issue 1:
As a delegate, I would vote against the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands. While I support the idea of using bounties to attract new users to Uniswap, I believe that giving Flipside crypto too much control over the allocation of UNI and oversight of the program could lead to centralization of power and create an unfair advantage for Flipside.
If I were to propose amendments to the proposal, I would suggest that other analytics service providers should also be involved in the proposal, and that the allocation committee and oversight committee should be more evenly balanced, with all parties having equal representation.
In terms of the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, I believe that a balanced approach is necessary. While it’s important to have clear leadership and decision-making structures in place, it’s equally important to ensure that power is not concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or organizations.
In this particular case, I believe that the Uniswap proposal tips the scales too far in favor of Flipside crypto and risks alienating other stakeholders in the community. As a delegate, I would work to ensure that any proposals that come before the DAO are fair, transparent, and promote the best interests of the community as a whole.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
As a delegate, I believe that the decision of whether or not to reimburse parties affected by an exploit should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation.
In the case of the Rari hack, I would carefully consider a number of factors, including the severity of the exploit, the impact on the community, and the feasibility of reimbursement. If the exploit was particularly damaging or if it was the result of a systemic issue within the platform, then full reimbursement may be appropriate.
However, if the exploit was the result of a user error or if it did not have a significant impact on the community, then no reimbursement may be necessary. In some cases, a split reimbursement may be appropriate, depending on the circumstances.
Ultimately, my approach would be to carefully consider all relevant factors and make a decision that is in the best interests of the community as a whole. It’s important to ensure that the decision-making process is transparent and fair, and that all members of the community are represented in the decision-making process.

The integrity and stability of these decentralized systems is what I lean on to support my community, and myself so violating the adage ""code is law,’ eventually will prove to a tragic flaw. I believe in true meritocracy, value for value, and game theory token economics as opposed to gimmick theory. That said, incentivized reimbursement rewarding contribution would be ideal as we all know the risks. The entire notion of open source is that with more eyes on the code, communities move more efficiently (ie. “always bet on missionaries” - Steve Wozniak). One could argue if the communities were more BUIDL driven top to bottom instead gamifying token price the there would never have been a hack.
Liquid staking, pairing tokens against liquidity tokens, similar to sushi swap index token all have the organic advantage of weeding out the short sighted and rewarding longterm “set it and forget it” hodler types.",1036

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision-making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of the wider community.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I believe liquidity mining is unnecessary on a chain like Arbitrum that already has a strong DeFi ecosystem.
I believe any token distributions should be used to incentivize the development of L3s on top of Arbitrum, as well as licensing of the Arbitrum technology (which will drive value to the Arbitrum DAO).

No ammendments.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

To strike a balance between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, organizations should delegate tasks, establish clear roles and responsibilities, and create efficient decision-making processes. This approach can maximize efficiency while maintaining decentralization principles. By continuously evaluating and adapting the organizational structure and processes, organizations can leverage the benefits of decentralization, such as increased trust, collaboration, and innovation, while maintaining overall competence and integrity.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
I would have voted for full reimbursement, as I believe the DAO has an obligation users to do whatever is possible to prevent user loss of funds.

Improving Governance participation
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Against
No amendments. Cancel it.
Centralization is the opposite of DAO. The greatest emphasis should be placed on the greatest possible participation of the community in the activities of the organization, including participation in voting. I want to avoid situations in which a small number of DAO participants (with the largest number of votes decided everything). The DAO should be the voice of the entire community involved in the system.

Sample Voting Issue 2:

Split Reimbursement
Of course, it is difficult to generalize about the return of hacked funds, because a lot depends on the specific situation - the reasons for the hack, the amount of losses, etc. A full refund should be preferred where it will not catastrophically impact the entire protocol and where the hack was not caused by team negligence.

im most interested in contributing to: NFT development on Arbitrum & Improving Governance participation
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
The goals of a DAO can vary depending on the nature of the organization and its members. Generally speaking, DAOs are designed to facilitate decentralized decision-making and provide a transparent and equitable platform for members to participate in governance and decision-making.
Regarding NFT development on Arbitrum, it is a specific area of focus for your DAO. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are a type of digital asset that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content. Arbitrum is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to improve its performance and reduce transaction costs. By focusing on NFT development on Arbitrum, Our DAO may aim to leverage the benefits of both NFTs and Arbitrum to create new opportunities for creators and collectors in the digital art and collectibles space. This could include developing new platforms, applications, or tools to facilitate the creation, trade, and ownership of NFTs on Arbitrum.
Regarding liquidity mining, the aggressiveness of the strategy will depend on the DAO’s specific goals and risk tolerance. Liquidity mining involves incentivizing users to provide liquidity to a decentralized exchange (DEX) by offering rewards in the form of cryptocurrency tokens. While it can help boost liquidity and trading volume, it also carries some risks, such as impermanent loss and potential token price volatility.
The DAO should carefully consider its liquidity mining strategy and evaluate the potential benefits and risks before deciding on the level of aggressiveness. It may be beneficial to start with a more conservative approach and gradually increase the rewards as the liquidity on the DEX grows. Additionally, the DAO should be transparent in its decision-making and communicate any changes in strategy to its members.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
How would you vote?

Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

If I were to propose an amendment to the proposal, it would be to increase the representation of other analytics service providers on the allocation committee and the oversight committee. This would provide more diversity of thought and perspectives and reduce the likelihood of a centralized power dynamic.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

Regarding the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done, it’s essential to strike a balance between the two. Decentralized platforms like Uniswap prioritize decentralization and community governance, and any proposal that undermines these principles should be approached with caution. While it’s crucial to get things done, it shouldn’t come at the expense of decentralization and community governance. A transparent and balanced decision-making process is crucial for the long-term sustainability of any decentralized platform.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
Full Reimbursement: If the hack was caused by a fault in the protocol, and the platform is responsible for the loss. Additionally, if the funds involved are significant and the hack was widespread, full reimbursement could help restore trust in the platform and prevent further loss. But, the decision to reimburse affected parties should be based on a careful evaluation of the situation, and a clear understanding of the root cause of the hack. Additionally, platforms should have clear guidelines in place to handle such incidents, and users should be aware of the risks involved in using decentralized platforms.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 1.2k
Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the moneys.

Liquidity mining is a popular strategy used by DAOs to incentivize liquidity providers and reward community members for contributing to the platform. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining can depend on a DAO’s goals and risk tolerance. A more aggressive approach to liquidity mining may lead to faster growth, but it may also increase volatility and risk.
Previous issues raised in other communities can vary widely, but some common ones include concerns about transparency, governance, and security. DAOs can address these issues by implementing transparent decision-making processes, strong security protocols, and community-driven governance structures.
Overall, the goals of a DAO and the approach to liquidity mining should be aligned with the needs and priorities of its community. DAOs can benefit from incorporating feedback and input from community members to ensure that their strategies and goals reflect the values and interests of the wider ecosystem.

3.The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a common challenge for any organization, including DAOs. On one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear leadership and decision-making, leading to faster execution and more efficient use of resources. On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision-making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of the wider community.

Our stance on overall goals for the DAO
We feel the DAO should be moderately aggressive. Enough to bring sufficient liquidity for the token, and to reward those who provide liquidity. But at the same time, not too high of liquidity rewards as not to dilute the token. Some of the benefits for liquidity mining are:

Liquidity mining can help to build a strong community around the DAO. By incentivizing users to participate in the network, the DAO can attract users who are passionate about the project. This can lead to a more engaged community that is willing to contribute to the network in other ways. For example, community members may help with marketing, development, or governance. This type of community building can help to ensure the long-term success of the DAO.
Another benefit of liquidity mining for a DAO is a more decentralized network. When users provide liquidity, they are essentially becoming stakeholders in the DAO. This means that they have a vested interest in the success of the network. As more users become stakeholders, the network becomes more decentralized. This is important for the long-term sustainability of the network as it reduces the risk of a single entity having too much control.
The goals of Arbitrum DAO are scalability, decentralization, and interoperability. The organization’s primary aim is to provide a Layer 2 scaling solution that can handle a high volume of transactions at a low cost, while still maintaining the security and transparency of the Ethereum network. With its decentralized governance structure, Arbitrum DAO is well-positioned to achieve its goals and contribute to the growth of the blockchain ecosystem.

ㅤㅤㅤㅤThe goal of a DAO should be to achieve its stated objectives while maintaining a healthy balance of risk and reward. This can involve careful management of liquidity mining rewards, as well as other strategies such as community engagement, partnerships, and marketing efforts.
ㅤㅤㅤㅤWhen setting goals for a DAO, it’s important to have a clear understanding of the organization’s purpose and objectives. This can involve conducting a thorough analysis of the DeFi landscape, identifying gaps or opportunities, and determining how the DAO can add value to the ecosystem.
ㅤㅤㅤㅤIt’s also important to consider the community of users and stakeholders that the DAO serves. Engaging with the community and seeking their input can help ensure that the goals of the DAO are aligned with the needs and interests of its members.
ㅤㅤㅤㅤIn terms of liquidity mining, it’s important to strike a balance between incentivizing users to contribute liquidity and maintaining a sustainable ecosystem. This can involve careful management of rewards and a focus on long-term sustainability rather than short-term gains.
ㅤㅤㅤㅤUltimately, the goals of a DAO should be ambitious yet achievable, with a focus on creating value for the community of users and stakeholders it serves. By working collaboratively and staying true to its purpose, a DAO can achieve its goals and contribute to the growth and development of the DeFi ecosystem. It’s important for DAO members to collaborate and work towards a shared vision for the organization, while also being open to diverse perspectives and opinions. By fostering a culture of open communication and collaboration, DAOs can achieve their goals in a sustainable and effective manner.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

ㅤㅤㅤㅤSeparate the grants into quarterly distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
ㅤㅤㅤㅤIntroduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
ㅤㅤㅤㅤIt’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralization are inversely proportional. As long as the centralized entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
ㅤㅤㅤㅤA DAO should consider having centralizing points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reimbursement

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?*
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.*

i.e. should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
ㅤㅤㅤㅤHacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
ㅤㅤㅤㅤFor this reason, I believe at least a partial reimbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.

If we look at the liquidity process, first of all, we have to keep a balance in these issues as well. Of course, this is an important indicator, but we should not chase it. We should focus on profitability, but also on convenience and security for the end user and the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.

For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.
My answer:


I would not support this proposal (in this original form).


No change to this decision (cancellation in its current form). It is important to always and everywhere find a balance. I would suggest developing a transparent grant program to stimulate new projects and partners (where there would be a clear distribution without outweighing the parties).


Accordingly, they would receive an equal share and rights. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?


Here also a balance is important.
It is possible to invite non-professional participants (not tied to the projects) to the boards of directors, where they will participate in the life and development of DAO (and as a motivation to receive some remuneration).
Thus, we exclude the interest of the parties and the maximum involvement in the development of DAO project.

My answer:


I would do a full refund. Judging by the polls, we see that the majority of participants were on the first ballot. Since we have to stand up for the interests of the rank and file.


When we are in the crypto and DeFi, we have to remember that we are the focus of everyone’s attention. We are a new industry and a field that is just emerging. That’s why we have to keep our users in mind, to protect and defend their interests. And also to absorb the best of the classical world of finance, while setting an example for the entire finance industry worldwide.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

The DAO should be focused on growing and supporting the Arbitrum chains and ecosystem without sacrificing security or decentralization. The DAO would benefit from supporting the development of public goods that increase the utility of the chains and supporting the development of protocols that can bring in more users. This means that the DAO should be as neutral and balanced as possible.
We will be focusing on the following goals:

Proactively improve security of the Arbitrum chains ecosystem.
Designing and building SDKs that expand Arbitrum’s capabilities and strengthen its security.



eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?

Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?
For
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

There are two approaches that could be taken to build consensus: (1) add additional third parties to the allocation and Oversight committees, or (2) reduce the funding for the program with the understanding that it will be increased if the program is successful. The first option reduces the reliance on one partner, while the second option would allow the partner to show they are good stewards and should be trusted to have more control.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is not practical to have a DAO vote on every matter, so some centralization of authority is necessary at some level. The DAO can provide some limited authority to committees that allow them to spend up to a certain level, engage with new partners, take emergency actions, etc. Committees are ultimately accountable to the DAO and the authorities and funding for a committee or project should reflect that.

Full Reimbursement
No Reimbursement
Split Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.

While proactive security measures are always preferable to being hacked and losing funds, history has shown that attacks resulting in a loss of user funds are an eventuality. The protocol that loses the users’ funds is ultimately responsible for that loss and should work to reimburse users. However, full and immediate reimbursement may not always be in the best interests of the protocol, depending on the amount of funds lost. One possibility is to reimburse affected users over time, so the damage to the viability of the protocol is limited.
By taking a balanced approach, projects can demonstrate their commitment to their users while also reinforcing the importance of risk management in the DeFi space.

Improving Governance participation and effectiveness
Supporting Infrastructure
IRL Arbitrum community gatherings

share my stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Different stages have different emphasis. Support the road towards full efficient decentralization. Oversight, improving Dao capabilities and executions, etc.
The goals of the DAO as I see it:
For Arbitrum to become a truly decentralized ecosystem it requires a truly decentralized, functional and efficient DAO. In a way. It’s like the consciousness of the ecosystem (vs the brain…).

becoming a decentralized entity
Developing capabilities: improve GOV’ and decision making, quality execution (originated from the DAO process), oversight capabilities, community, develop the rules of tomorrow- that supports the ecosystem and values (economic/governance/ethics).

Liquidity mining (APY for staked ARBI),Profit sharing model will be the standard IMO, it is both like dividends and revenue for security or even just price stability…
Must be derived from the revenue mostly- “real yield” model.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?
For
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Mainly just more checks and balances with creating a road map to give more emphasis to decentralization. How will this change in the future to support this vision?
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Short term- some compromises can be taken to support growth, efficiency, etc.

End goal should be fully “autonomous” operated by the DAO, which has proved high capabilities and efficiency way above the curve.
Finally, to tie the 2 together, there needs to be a smart contract till the Target day arrives. Smart contracts will support the process. Even “crazy” things like deciding no entity can hold more than 5% of total supply- I know I get scolded for that suggestion but I do believe it’s ok to put some lines for the good of the chain, community and everyone…. Usually, if someone wants to hold, lets say 30%, they will deal with power games, or have self interest they can manipulate the chain. But I’m way off topic 
Sample Voting Issue 2:

How would you vote?
Split Reimbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

ARBI must have a self insurance fund- generated from the yield as it is planned 
So, I would think of spreading the debt over the next few years and generate the payments from the fund. Maybe a mixed solution should be also considered.

NFT development on Arbitrum
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As a seasoned NFT, collaboration manager I believe the DAO should focus on creating a robust ecosystem that drives innovation in the NFT spaces. It is essential for the DAO to strike a balance between aggressive liquidity mining and sustainable growth, prioritizing long-term value creation. The DAO should also actively support and fund projects that push the boundaries of what is possible on Arbitrum.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
How would you vote?
Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would propose a more decentralized allocation and oversight committee structure, ensuring that Flipside doesn’t hold a majority of seats. I’d also advocate for the inclusion of other analytics service providers to foster a more competitive and diverse ecosystem, reducing potential biases.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
In my experience, the key to balancing centralization and efficiency is by implementing a well-structured governance framework. By creating multi-signature decision-making processes and transparent voting systems, we can maintain decentralization while still achieving our objectives efficiently.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Split Reimbursement
In my extensive experience with NFT projects, I’ve observed that a split reimbursement approach offers a fair solution. This approach holds project teams accountable for their security measures while still providing relief to affected users. Full reimbursement should be reserved for situations where the exploit is entirely beyond the project team’s control.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Supporting Infrastructure

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The Arbitrum DAO should be growth oriented in choosing to build and work with growth partners that are going to bring the next trillions of transactions to the Arbitrum layer and scale the stack into a broader consumer market. Liquidity mining should only occur in extremely targeted ways, if at all. Arbitrum DAO will only ever have the tokens that it has now (+ any potential future inflation) and should therefore spend the tokens as wisely as possible.
Arbitrum already has a product that people care about. Better plays in my eyes would be to provide grants to attract new customers that will further scale Arbitrum (e.g. provide a grant to attract somebody like the NYSE to deploy on an L3.) I would also advise that any liquidity mining that does occur should also implement some vesting mechanism on earned Arbitrum, with a way to delegate and vote with vesting ARB.
Sample Voting Issue 1
How would you vote? Against - but not due to centralisation.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any? If the service is worthwhile, pay for it rather than risking treasury to generate yield that pays for it. With the team in that proposal planning on interacting with any other contracts other than Uniswap or Aave that haven’t undergone serious battle-hardening and vetting there is a real risk of smart contract failure. In my view it’s not worth risking ARB treasury for community analytics which often are created anyway if there’s traction with the project. If analytics are in demand by the community then direct funding with ARB is a better path without posing any significant treasury risk.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done? The biggest threat to Arbitrum that I see is not being able to move fast enough to provide support to grow and maintain market share. With this view, I believe that centralisation of authority is fine. This is caveated with a requirement for absolute transparency and clear oversight from an expert committee. DAO governance can often slow entities down and it’s important that Arbitrum remains fast. I think another key piece is to ensure that anywhere centralisation exists, there is a dispute / eject protocol so that should a group like this start misbehaving, ultimately there is oversight by the DAO / community. Let’s give autonomy to people to create action, but ensure that misbehaving is punished.
Sample Voting Issue 2
Split Reimbursement
A partial reimbursement should be paid for by the DAO depending on the economic strength of the project. Both because FEI RARI and its token-holder community should value it’s customers and wish for them to return to the protocol and also because it is fair to do with a significant treasury and also important to maintain brand.
With that being said, customers are using speculative DeFi products and should be comfortable taking the risk that all funds could be lost from deposits as emerging technology can be risky and difficult to build. If the code is fully audited and there exists the appropriate bug bounties and avenues for blackhats to become whitehats, then this team has done basically as much as possible.
Smart contract developers and teams that have gone to the length of getting top tier firms to audit their code for vulnerabilities should not be forced to pay out in full for protocol exploits. These audits are a large cost, as are the payouts. It’s important that these teams retain runway in order to build the future of the decentralised financial system.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
First and foremost, the purpose of a DAO is to allow for the healthy and decentralised development of the rollup. This vision, of course, can entail many different aspects, from the more technical and security focused sections of the rollup (which the DAO should have oversight over) to encouraging the development of a healthy ecosystem and growth with the ARB token. Basically, every decision the DAO makes should return to the question: ’ How does this benefit the long-term sustainability and success of not just the ARB token, but also the broader future of rollups?’ .
From this question we can begin exploring different roles that the DAO could assume in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, and the careful balancing act that follows for each decision. Some examples include:
Technical protocol and security upgrades: If arbitrum truly wants to be community owned, they need to have an oversight over what the protocol will develop into and all the layers that are part of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, the average voter will probably not be knowledgeable enough to vote in good faith on whether a development will be fruitful or not. One potential solution that could be explored is a technical subcommittee in charge of overseeing this side of governance, which ultimately might report back to the wider DAO. The DAO is already planning to do this with the Security Council, but this same idea could be implemented in other technical areas.
Liquidity Mining - While this strategy can assist for the short-term growth and user acquisition on the protocols selected for these campaigns, it should not be seen as a permanent fixture of any protocol. Liquidity mining serves as a great opportunity for someone to get acquainted somewhere new in search of the yield, but if subsidised too long by the Arbitrum DAO, it could lead to an unhealthy subsidy of protocols through unsustainable emissions.
Grants - While liquidity mining handles growing users and technical committees handle the rollup itself, grants are the greatest part of the DAO that will target builders. Grants have to be handled carefully, as they have a degree of social trust needed both from the DAO and the builders. Builders have to be able to demonstrate deliverables for the amount and accountability. Despite the complications, grants will allow for the development of tools and dApps that the space might need, but currently might not be as profitable.
These are just some examples of DAO goals, but of course there are endless more possibilities on what might be handled!
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to be able to function efficiently in the long term. Even though it brings a degree of centralisation, as long as they do not control an excessive amount of the larger DAO and they have sufficient accountability measures it’s a good initiative.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.
Introduce checkpoints across the delegation period: In addition to having a committee handling immediate matters related to the grant, it would’ve been preferable to also introduce routine votes to ensure that the DAO was still comfortable with such a large allocation. This would have also encouraged the grantee to increase accountability and deliver accountability reports.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
It’s inevitable that effectiveness and decentralisation are inversely proportional. As long as the centralised entities are still ultimately dependent on the DAOs approval, and they operate as transparently as possible, this is a necessary tool for the development of the DAO.
A DAO should consider having centralising points only when specialists are required to act knowledgeable and quickly, something which the Vox Populi of the DAO might struggle with. The entities to do this should be trusted members of the space of course.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement

Split Reimbursement
Hacks and loss of funds are to this day one of the strongest blockers we have from people trusting the space and onboarding onto it. Every time a large draining of protocol contracts occurs, the idea of the Financial Legos gets threatened, as people become less and less willing to risk connecting with other protocols.
For this reason, I believe at least a partial reinbursement is always to be considered when a protocol has decided to cooperate with you. These parties decided to entrust the security of your smart contracts, and their dedication and trust that was placed onto the protocol should be thanked by at least trying to provide some funds back. In the future, this could even be handled with DAO insurance protocols, which are already being developed in the space.
However, I would be hesitant to provide a full reinbursement when the hack has already severely impacted the protocol so badly. If the amount won’t make that much of a difference to the bottom line it makes sense to give a reinbursement, but in this particular case the double impact of the hack was so severe that this lead to one of the first instances of a DAO explicitly closing doors. 13 A full reinbursement , in terms of impact, would be the same as a second equally devastating hack.
TL;DR Provide enough compensation to thank the participants for engaging in the system, but while a full reinbursement might help these stakeholders, the impact of this action could lead to the DAO entering a negative death spiral.

Currently, I am spending most of my time working on the ParaSwap DAO. This means that I will automatically abstain from any discussion that might involve DEX Aggregation, as my opinion will obviously be biased. The positive side of this participation is that ParaSwap is also deployed in Arbitrum, which means that the success of Arbitrum will also positively impact ParaSwap (through increased liquidity sources and volumes), as well as vice versa (by encouraging efficiency and decentralisation of liquidity in the rollup by aggregating all of these together through a single, simple to access interface).
Additionaly, I also applied to be a delegate on the Optimism collective, which although is also part of the wider ethereum ecosystem it could be considered a conflict of interest. Currently, I am being allocated ~ 1k OP. In addition to this, ParaSwap has also been selected as one of the Protocol Delegate Scheme recipients, and if necessary, the representative of ParaSwap could be a different DAO member if this is considered a major conflict of interest.

Our Vision:
Voluntary Commitment
As the name suggests, the “Autonomous Decentralization” DAO has no specific authority or pyramid structure. Unlike a company where a CEO makes decisions and gives instructions to employees, DAOs work differently. Instead, the premise of working in a DAO is that everyone actively demonstrates their unique abilities and contributes to the project. The DAO needs your advice and contributions, and you are always a “proposer” and a “contributor.” To work in a DAO, your project and interests should have a high degree of fit, and your contribution is maximized when “what you can/want to do” and “what the DAO should do” overlap. In a DAO, no one will give you directions. If you contribute a lot, you will be recognized as a “core contributor” and rewarded.
Pay for Performance and Participate Anonymously
When working for a DAO, there is no need to provide personal information beyond what is necessary. Age, gender, and nationality do not matter. The DAO rewards are based on contributions made, and a flat, pay-for-performance society governs the DAO. Traditional work ethics such as showing loyalty to a boss or working earlier than others have no place in a DAO.
Rewards Are Tokens
The reward for contributions made to the DAO is project-issued tokens. Accepting fiat currency as a reward is a special case, and it is common sense to receive tokens in a cryptocurrency wallet. Tokens earned as rewards can be sold on the spot or held and managed as-is. These tokens are governance (voting) tokens, and the more you contribute, the more governance tokens you earn. You can reflect your intentions and interests in important decisions regarding the project. Using rewards as tokens to create a form of gameplay is also an innovation of a DAO.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
Voting is essential to democracy, and it is worth exploring effective ways to distribute power to everyone.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
DAOs are decentralized in nature, meaning they lack a central authority. However, this can pose challenges when it comes to decision-making and taking action. To address this tradeoff, the organization’s goals, structure, and community need to be analyzed. It is crucial to determine how decentralized the organization should be to achieve its objectives. Striking a balance between centralization and decentralization is necessary, and establishing smart contracts or clear guidelines and protocols for decision-making and operations can help maintain a successful DAO.

Outside of flipping the vote, how would you handle this situation? Should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and elaborate on your reasoning)

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
Efforts should be made to compensate customers for the losses incurred due to the bug. It is essential to maintain customer trust, and refunds are necessary in cases where customers have suffered losses. However, the extent of the reimbursement should be determined based on the severity of the loss and the extent of the bug’s impact. Additionally, a system should be put in place to prevent such bugs from happening in the future.",1086

Please share your stance on the overall goals for the DAO:
In my view, a DAO should place a strong emphasis on decentralization, transparency, and inclusivity when making decisions in order to truly reflect the views of its community. While I understand the significance of liquidity mining, I believe that a DAO should be cautious when implementing it and prioritize the support of its most active users and builders. Additionally, I believe that investing in Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum is critical for the platform’s widespread adoption. Therefore, it’s essential for the DAO to allocate funds towards public goods initiatives to foster the growth and advancement of the ecosystem, as exemplified by the positive outcomes of the Optimism Grants program.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

I would oppose to this proposal due to the following reasons:


Conflict of interest between grant committees and self-funding.
Excessive management fees of 50%.
Lack of clarity and transparency regarding the 30% estimated APR


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?


Establish clear guidelines for conflict of interest and ensure that committees managing grants are not able to pay themselves a share for funding their own operations.
Set a reasonable limit on management fees, such as 10-20%, to ensure that the majority of the funds are being used for the intended purpose.
Clearly explain and provide transparent models for any estimated APR or other financial projections, to give community members the ability to evaluate the proposal and make informed decisions.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?


The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach, using good sense and being flexible would be my approach.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
I’d vote for full reimbursement here. While it may put some sell pressure on governance tokens, I think it’s the right move if a DAO has enough in its treasury to cover hack losses. All parties involved need to be taken into account, and with multiple DAOs claiming the distributed funds, a solution must be reached that benefits everyone. We should exhaust DAO funds before turning to governance tokens or team allocations. Of course, I’d do my research and carefully consider all interests involved before voting.

Improving Governance participation
Supporting Infrastructure

The overall goal of a DAO will depend on its specific mission and objectives, for example

Providing decentralized financial services including but not limited to  lending, borrowing, and trading, to its members.
Building a strong community includes focus on building a strong community of members who share a common interest or goal.
Supporting innovation  by funding or investing in new technologies or applications.
Creating social impact: by addressing social or environmental issues through its operations.

As far as  Liquidity mining, it is a mechanism that incentivizes liquidity providers to contribute their assets to a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol by rewarding them with additional tokens. The goal of liquidity mining is to increase liquidity on the protocol, which can lead to lower fees, reduced slippage, and increased trading volumes.
The decision on how aggressive to be in liquidity mining will depend on the goals and resources of the DAO. It can be a powerful tool to incentivize participation and increase liquidity on the protocol. However, it is important to balance the benefits of liquidity mining with the potential risks, such as dilution of token value and increased volatility.
I will go against with the proposal on Uniswap vs Flipside.
I will ammend overall structure of committee and grant as well.
Personally I feel there should be no representation more than 1 seat for any organisation in any board or committee. In this case flipside had 3 votes which could change the overall decision. In my opinion only 1 representation must be allowed for an organisation for fair decision
Also I will propose the way of distribution of Grant based on their KPI’s and changed term from annual to either quarterly or bi-annually with multiple level funding. That would help to make this effective and add more organisation as beneficiaries.
The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done can be approached by balancing the benefits of centralization and decentralization, establishing clear roles and responsibilities, fostering open communication, implementing checks and balances, and delegating decision-making power to low-level members.
Regarding FEI Rari Hack, my first question would be where is the Risk coverage. When you run such as big organisation involve with Finacing and DAO there must be Risk Assessment where all these present and future risks are considered. In this case it seems that coverage is not there so for the sake of reputation and scalability I would go for Full Reimbursement. That would not only save the goodwill of the company but  also add the level of trust from stakeholders. Even reimbursement are done  I would further go for future risk coverage to avoid such kind of incident exploiting the whole setup and strengthen the security controls by adding additional layer that would help me to address such in future.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:


Acknowledge the importance of the NFT communities and the current “meta” of the arbitrum ecosystem. Arbitrum is not only Defi and on-chain treasuries. Arbitrum is a group of individuals that have been giving their time and loyalty to this ecosystem. This needs to be seen.


Ensure true decentralization of decisions while mantaining common sense on the issues that should be delegated to trusted members of the community (for example: As a delegate i would not interfere in technical decisions made by the offchain labs team or arbitrum engineers unless they clearly threaten some important value or aspect of decentralization)


Facilitate user onboarding. One of the goals of the DAO should be to incentivize user on-ramps to arbitrum, seamless bridging and a good UX. This could be achieved by improving the current arbitrum bridge platform or by opening a pool of grants to incentivize new teams to develop new systems.


Decentralize TVL. Arbitrum TVL is in the hands of some major protocols and with the risk of failure of some of those protocols comes the downfall of the ecosystem. We need to attract new forms of TVL


Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
Against
While delegation is a great way to simplify voting, it has to be done with care and transparency. Also, individuals have the right to participate, not only delegates.
Groups should not be operating with the dao bounties in private.



What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?*



The proposal should state that:

The bounties should have a platform where they can be voted by individuals or by delegates
Each bounty has to be voted individually
Each bounty has to be proposed following a template that discloses all it’s information to the public

If there has to be a team in charge of setting things up this team should:

Adhere to transparency. Publish biweekly reports of progress, work on an opensource way.
Allow from feedback from the community

There should be in place a mechanism for the token holders to revoke power from this team if it doesn’t deliver what is promised.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?*

Things can be done in a decentralized way when operated by small teams with close oversight from voters and community members.
Teams have to be incentivized to deliver. This could mean: good salaries or good upside in DAO tokens that reward their professionality.

Full Reimbursement (ONLY IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET)
Okay, so this would really depend on the DAO treasury at that time.
My main thoughts are:

The DAO should not sell DAO tokens to reimburse users. Selling DAO tokens (unless with the approval of a great part of the DAO members, and not by voting power, but by realm amount of people) should not be done, because it damages DAO investors.
DAOs should accumulate treasuries not formed by the DAO tokens and have good risk management to be able to cover the losses suffered.
DAOS should be able to burn the treasury to cover for DAO losses if necessary, leaving a little runway to continue operating.

Then, depending on the damage done to the people/users of the protocol, i would advocate for closing shop or not.
Companies fail in real life too, but the most important part is to not damage people, and try to make it right.

how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
I am not the biggest fan of liquidity mining, at least not directly from a DAO; I think that in the best of many cases the best is to apply to different protocols that kind of incentives, maybe like Optimism that brought diverse uses to its network incentivizing it in an indirect way in usability and ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO, if a small group centralizes power, the name DAO is only an aggregate.
Something that can help is to predefine in the beginning the creation of committees and delimit the members it should have at the expense of increasing diversity against personal interests.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is a bad reference to the DAOs, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree, but I feel that the committees or delegates fulfill that vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize the governance processes.
Sample Voting Issue 2:

Split Reimbursement

A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and also take into account their survival, therefore it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, by literally draining their funds I do not think they can pay.
That’s why I think the best thing to do, and depending on the case like FEI, is to return money to those affected, maybe under a vesting system or the DAO can get down to work to look after the interests of its users.

Cornell University is a leader in the blockchain community, from alumni founders of organizations such as Avalanche, Ribbon finance, Tezos and Cosmos Tendermint to the development of IC3, the leading academic consortium in the field. In 2022, Cornell was ranked the #2 university to study blockchain in the United States by CoinDesk and #5 in the world.
The primary objective of the DAO is to find the optimal balance between growth and long-term sustainability, while adhering to the fundamental principles of decentralization and community involvement. To accomplish this, I believe the following goals should be emphasized:

Promote community-led initiatives that enrich the Arbitrum ecosystem and drive its overall expansion and progression.
Emphasize the development and upkeep of essential infrastructure to improve user experience, security, and decentralization within the Arbitrum network.
Concentrate on supporting projects and teams dedicated to long-term value creation, rather than focusing on short-term gains or solely profit-driven capital investments.
Ensure transparency and open dialogue in the decision-making process, giving all stakeholders a voice and properly disclosing any conflicts of interest.
Stimulate innovation and experimentation in governance, recognizing that the status quo can always be enhanced and that the Arbitrum DAO should lead the charge in these advancements.

By adhering to these principles, we believe the Arbitrum DAO can effectively guide the growth and success of the network while upholding the core values that underpin the broader Web3 ecosystem.

We would vote in favor of the proposal, as we believe it offers a valuable opportunity to attract new users to Uniswap and fund the project through yield-generating activities. However, we also recognize the need for some adjustments to address concerns raised by the community.


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?


While voting in favor, I would still recommend the following amendments to address some concerns:
Move to quarterly payments instead of bulk yearly payments. This would allow the community to evaluate the project’s progress and success before allocating more resources to it. By doing so, it would encourage accountability, ensure better management of funds, and enable the community to make more informed decisions about the project’s future.
Reconsider the allocation of seats on the allocation and oversight committees to ensure a more balanced distribution of power. This could involve involving other analytics service providers or independent parties who don’t have conflicts of interest


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?


Striking the right balance between centralization of authority and the ability to execute projects efficiently is crucial. I believe in fostering an environment that promotes collaboration and diversity of ideas while ensuring that the decision-making process remains agile.
This tradeoff highly depends on the nature and objective of the project. For this specific proposal, we wouldn’t mind sacrificing a bit of decentralization in order to maximize productivity and efficiency. However, it’s essential that the decision-making process and fund allocation are transparent to preserve the decentralized aspect. The community should be able to see the progress, hold those responsible accountable, and possibly veto actions if they disagree. This would create a system where the benefits of centralization can be leveraged without undermining the core principles of decentralization that underpin Uniswap’s governance.

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

Full Reimbursement



In the event of a security exploit, managing the resulting panic and chaos while maintaining the trust and credibility of the platform is crucial. As decentralized protocols heavily rely on community support, the trust of the community plays a significant role in a protocol’s success. With this in mind, we advocate for fully reimbursing the affected parties to preserve trust and demonstrate the platform’s commitment to user security. Although participating in crypto inherently involves risk, full reimbursement can bolster community trust and place the protocol in a stronger position for the long term. It is also essential for Fei to investigate the root cause of the hack and develop a plan to prevent similar incidents in the future. Communicating this detailed plan with the community will further enhance the protocol’s credibility.


However, if the platform lacks sufficient funds to fully reimburse all affected parties, a split reimbursement approach is preferable. In such a scenario, it is vital to transparently communicate this information to the community, along with the underlying facts. This approach demonstrates accountability and helps retain trust in the protocol. FEI could then cover a portion of users’ losses, possibly based on their contribution levels and using a vesting system. Additionally, the platform should provide the option for the DAO to vote on full reimbursement when the protocol’s treasury reaches a strong and stable position. This ensures that users’ interests are taken into account.

Arbitrum was developed to address Ethereum’s scalability problem.
The Arbitrum DAO’s objective is to govern and manage the Arbitrum network, ensuring the smooth and efficient functioning of this public good while maintaining decentralization, transparency, and community participation.
The Arbitrum DAO should enable community members to participate in network governance by voting on proposals related to network upgrades, fee structures, and other critical decisions that affect the network’s performance and overall health.
We have aso to consider, the DAO’s goal to incentivize developers and other community members to contribute to the network’s growth and development. How? by providing grants, bounties, and other rewards for their contributions. This incentivization helps to ensure that the network remains innovative, secure, and reliable, thereby attracting more users and developers to the ecosystem.
Overall, the Arbitrum DAO’s primary goal is to create a decentralized and self-sustaining ecosystem that empowers community members to contribute to the network’s growth and development while maintaining its security, decentralization, and integrity.
The proposal gives Flipside direct control over allocating Uniswap tokens to bounties, as well as overseeing the entire program. This plan’s outline and funding were acceptable, but community members raised concerns because it gave Flipside too much power on both the allocation committee and oversight committee, which raised concerns about its centralized power. It was also worrying that none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal. The proposal initially went unnoticed, but as voting deadline drew near, it garnered a great deal of attention. University clubs supported the proposal primarily because they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, some members of the community, such as Dune and Leshner, spoke up against it, highlighting potential issues with centralization and favoritism.
My vote:
Against. Despite the DAO should move forward it shouldn’t be at any cost.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
As centralization can be useful in some cases, it is essential to balance it with decentralization and transparency to promote a healthy and sustainable program where all the members feel comfortable.
For example, Uniswap’s proposal could benefit from the involvement of more than one analytics service provider, which would allow a more diverse range of opinions to be heard and a fairer distribution of power. It is also important to ensure transparency and accountability in decision-making processes, which would help mitigate the risk of centralization. To fix this issue: regular reporting and auditing of the program’s progress and outcomes.
While centralization can have its benefits (for example speed), it is important to balance it with decentralization and transparency to create a robust ecosystem. Flipside had significant representation on both the allocation committee and the oversight committee, which raised concerns about the centralization of power and favoritism towards one service provider. It was also worrying that none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal. However, as voting deadline drew near, it garnered significant attention from University clubs that supported it primarily because they would get a seat on the allocation committee.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is challenging, and it’s essential to find a balance between the two. On one hand, centrallization can lead to faster decision making and more efficient execution of tasks. On other hand, it can lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals or organizations, which can be risky and potentially harmful. Hence, it’s vital to prioritize building and maintaining a strong community, where all members feel valued and included. This can help to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among community members, leading to increased participation and contribution to the network’s growth and development.
Finding a balance between centralization and decentralization is essential to promote a sustainable ecosystem. Should decision-making be transparent, accountable, and inclusive to promote community participation and to mitigate the risks of centralization.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Split Reimbursement: This option could be appropriate as the exploit occurred due to a combination of factor… In such a scenario, the parties may be partially responsible for the exploit, and a split reimbursement could be an appropriate remedy to compensate them for their losses.
Ultimately, the decision to reimburse parties for an exploit should be based on a careful assessment of the circumstances surrounding the incident, such as the severity of the exploit, the parties’ responsibility, and the impact on the network’s overall health and reputation. It’s important to ensure that any reimbursement decision is fair and equitable, promotes accountability and responsibility, and does not incentivize malicious or negligent behavior.

Separate the grants into quarterly distributions: distributions: For an allocation as large as 25 Million, I don’t believe that it is wise to simply divide it into Year 1 and Year 2. I understand that half of it was going to employing staff so they would rather have the reserve upfront, but considering that the only upside of delivering such amounts once a year is saving some time on transactions and communications, it feels that dividing the allocations into at least quarterly separations would’ve been wiser.

If this were a case of introducing a self-executable on-chain transfer block on the hacked amount and reminting into the damaged parties’ accounts, I would vote yes. If the tokenholders and other network participants were to pay for this, no. Socializing losses across a large number of people is not acceptable when it is clear that very small circles of people are responsible for both insecure code and stealing the money.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation

Introduction
Bristol Blockchain Society, founded in November 2022, is a non-profit organization based at the University of Bristol, a top 5 UK research university. We have around 50 active members from various academic backgrounds, including computer science, law, economics, engineering, and PhD students. We have two primary arms: Education and Governance. As one of the few active UK blockchain societies, we are dedicated to contributing to the blockchain space and promoting education in the field.
We are currently involved in the governance of AAVE and dYdX, contributing to these projects for free, with no voting power or monetary compensation, driven purely by our passion for the blockchain space and the desire to contribute positively to its growth. Our vision for the future of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its governance includes improving various aspects of the protocol, raising viewpoints from underrepresented groups, and actively participating in the decision-making process. Our team’s diverse expertise and commitment to the advancement of blockchain technology make us an ideal choice for Arbitrum users seeking knowledgeable and dedicated delegates.
By delegating even a small amount to Bristol Blockchain Society, you are not only helping increase decentralisation within the Arbitrum ecosystem, but also empowering our passionate team to have a voice in the governance process.
Your support will ensure that our efforts are acknowledged, and our contributions can make a positive impact on the ecosystem. We appreciate any support you can provide, as it demonstrates that our work is valued and our voices are heard, even without the backing of voting power or monetary incentives.
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
In our opinion, the overall goals of the DAO should be to foster innovation, promote decentralisation, and create a sustainable and inclusive ecosystem for all stakeholders.
The DAO’s broad objectives are:
1. Sustainable Growth: A DAO should strive for sustainable growth that is advantageous to its community and ecosystem. This consists of finding a fine balance between rapid growth and ensuring long-term stability.
2. Decentralisation and inclusivity: Maintaining decentralisation and ensuring that the decision-making process is inclusive so that all members can have a say in the organization’s direction. These are important objectives of a DAO.
3. Transparency: Establishing trust among DAO members and stakeholders requires transparency.  The DAO should provide clear and accessible information about its activities, governance, and financials.
4. Adaptability: The DAO should be agile and adaptable, able to respond to changing market conditions and technological advancements. This means being open to innovation and constantly evaluating new opportunities.
Regarding liquidity mining, the DAO should be cautious about being overly aggressive. While it can provide short-term benefits by attracting new participants, it can also lead to inflated token prices and a lack of sustainability in the long run. The goal should be to strike a balance that provides incentives for participation while maintaining long-term stability and value creation.

Sample Voting Issue 1:
Prompts to Answer:
As the Bristol Blockchain Society, we stand:
1. How would you vote?
Against - While we appreciate the concept of using Uniswap’s treasury to generate fees, we cannot support the proposal in its current form due to the concerns outlined below. We believe changes are necessary for a more balanced and inclusive program.
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?:
We are concerned about the centralisation of power within Flipside, as they are the contracted vendor, manager of the funds, and hold significant influence on both the allocation and oversight committees. This centralisation should be addressed.
While we recognize the value of having a CEA in this proposal, we question whether it should be solely represented by Flipside, especially considering the concerns mentioned above.
We suggest that, in the best interest of the community, Flipside should consider including other parties (particularly competitors) to foster a more competitive and diverse environment. Reducing Flipside’s voting power to 2/7 or even 1/7 would help prevent undue influence and ensure more balanced decision-making.
We acknowledge that the Flipside team has been a valuable contributor across DeFi and DAOs. However, it is crucial to maintain decentralisation and diversity to truly serve the best interests of the community.
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
In approaching the tradeoff between centralisation of authority and the ability to get things done, we would prioritize decentralisation and inclusiveness while ensuring efficiency in decision-making. A balance can be achieved by diversifying representation, reducing the concentration of power, and encouraging collaboration among various stakeholders.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
In this situation, we would choose the option of Full Reimbursement. Our reasoning for this choice is based on the following factors:
User Protection: A primary objective of any protocol should be the protection and well-being of its users. Providing full reimbursement in the event of an exploit demonstrates our commitment to safeguarding users’ assets and ensuring their trust in the platform. This approach fosters a sense of security and confidence among the user base, which is vital for the long-term success and growth of the protocol.
Responsibility and Accountability: By opting for full reimbursement, we take responsibility for any security breaches or vulnerabilities within the protocol, emphasizing the importance of accountability within the ecosystem. This decision sends a strong message to the community that we will stand by our users and strive to rectify any adverse situations that may arise. To minimize risks, a protocol can invest in buying insurance, which can provide additional layers of protection for the platform and its users.
Long-term Sustainability: It’s true that a DAO reimbursement may cause the protocol to wind down; however, it’s a commitment to the users that we prioritize their well-being and security above all else.
In conclusion, a full reimbursement is a user-centric approach that prioritizes user protection and demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the best possible experience for our community. By taking responsibility for any security breaches or vulnerabilities and standing by our users, we can maintain and enhance our reputation and credibility, fostering long-term sustainability and growth within the DeFi ecosystem.

Eric: The guiding pricinple of Layer 2 DAO governance should be that the ideals and ethos that made Ethereum successful must be preserved in its upper layers. If they are not preserved in the upper layers, and Layer 2s become the gravitational center for transactions, the soul of Ethereum will be lost.

Eric: Against


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?



Eric: The proposal should include a Bounty Committee that is represented by a broad range of community participants. Alternatively, there should be programmatic controls on how many bounties the original committee should be able to allocate in a day and UNI holders should be able to terminate the bounty program via vote.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?



Eric: It’s always a balance. It’s perfectly acceptable to elect centralized committees to ensure progress but have their powers limited in scope and revokable by the larger community.

Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO: As a supporter of decentralization, my primary goal for the DAO is to promote decentralization, transparency, and efficiency. Liquidity mining can be a useful tool to achieve these goals, but it should be implemented carefully to avoid centralized control over the network.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

For the Uniswap Flipside proposal, I would vote against it in its current form. Giving one service provider too much control over allocation and oversight of the program undermines decentralization and could lead to conflicts of interest. To address this issue, I would recommend amending the proposal to include other analytics service providers and distribute decision-making power more equitably among all involved parties.
The tradeoff between centralization and efficiency is delicate and depends on the context. In the case of Uniswap’s proposal, prioritizing decentralization over efficiency is necessary to avoid centralization of power.

FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

Full Reimbursement
No Reimbursement
Split Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.

In the FEI RARI hack reimbursement issue, parties affected by an exploit should be reimbursed to some extent, depending on the circumstances. The decision to reimburse should be based on factors such as the severity of the exploit, the impact on the network, and the level of responsibility of the affected parties. Without knowing all the specifics of the hack, it is difficult to determine whether or not to reimburse. However, I would be inclined to support partial reimbursement rather than full reimbursement, as full reimbursement could incentivize bad actors to engage in malicious behavior.
Languages I speak and write: English
Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest:
To ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of the network and its users, it is critical for delegates to affirm that they do not have any conflicts of interest that could influence their judgment when making decisions that impact the Arbitrum ecosystem.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
As Abracadabra DAO, we believe that our overall goal is to continue to foster innovation and growth in the DeFi space. We have seen the success of Arbitrum in taking on market share by attracting teams to build on top of their platform. We believe that this strategy needs to be continued, and as such, we plan to actively assess new projects and teams to help them jump start their platform on Arbitrum itself.
Collaboration and partnership are key to continuing growth, and we are committed to fostering an environment that encourages these values.
Please share your stance on issues that were raised previously, in other communities, as described below:
Sample Voting Issue 1:

How would you vote?

As Abracadabra DAO, carefully reviews each of the proposal and conducts its own thorough analysis of the potential risks and benefits of such proposal. In the case of Flipside, we would be inclined to vote against it in its current form, given the concerns about centralization of power and favoring of one service provider over others.


Against


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?


We would suggest reducing Flipside’s control over allocating UNI to these bounties and increasing the involvement of other analytics service providers in the proposal. A 3/7 seats allocation towards Flipside is far too imbalanced and should be amended to reduce Flipside to 1 seat and give the other 2 seats to other analytics service providers.
Revising the oversight committee to ensure a more equitable distribution of power makes sense as well. Might remove Flipside from this committee completely and add a more neutral party.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

We believe that a balance must be struck. While it’s important to have clear lines of authority and decision making to ensure efficient execution of plans, it’s equally important to ensure that power is not concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or entities.
During periods of growth, it may be reasonable to adopt a more centralized approach, as long as there are clearly defined timelines for when decentralization will occur. This enables even DAOs to quickly and systematically introduce new initiatives, with a clear plan for gradually reducing centralization over time.
As a DAO ourselves, we prioritize transparency, inclusivity, and decentralized decision making. We would strive to ensure that any proposal we support aligns with these values and promotes the long term growth and success of Arbitrum and the broader DeFi ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

Split Reimbursement

As a DAO that governs a DeFi protocol, Abracadabra believes that security is of utmost importance in the DeFi ecosystem.
Regarding the issue of reimbursement, we believe in taking a case by case approach. While we understand the sentiment behind full reimbursement, we also recognize that it may set a precedent that incentivizes risky behavior and lacks accountability. On the other hand, a blanket policy of no reimbursement discourages future participation and could inhibit growth.
In case of the Rari hack, we would take into account any security measures that were in place at the time of the hack and the level of responsibility of the parties involved. Based on this thorough evaluation, we would consider a split reimbursement as a potential solution.
Overall we believe that there are certain instances where reimbursement may be appropriate. A balance between covering damages for the user but still leaving enough funds to further improve the project is of the utmost importance.

Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.

Reimbursements can be appropriate in certain instances, as long as they do not completely deplete the treasury of the protocol. It is important for the protocol to be able to withstand a reimbursement and still have enough funds to function, grow and improve its security measures. If a full reimbursement would leave the protocol with no funds to continue operating, it would be doomed to fail and would not be a viable option. In such cases, a partial reimbursement may be more appropriate to balance the needs of the users and the sustainability of the protocol. Ultimately each situation must be evaluated on a case by case basis, taking into account the specific circumstances and the long term implications for the protocol.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation
Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I believe that the main goal of the DAO is to make better use of available resources for the benefit of Arbitrum by transferring governance into the hands of the community. As for liquidity mining, I think that DAO should not take aggressive actions because Arbitrum has a serious competitive advantage over its competitors - such as a large number of unique projects – and in the near future able to grow sustainably without it.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Against
We should not allow power to be centralized in the hands of a narrow circle of people who are poorly accountable to the DAO. I would suggest putting more people on the oversight committee and making the Allocation Commission more accountable to them.
I believe that the primary tasks of the protocol should be handled by the development team to increase the speed of realization and efficiency. While secondary tasks such as grant distribution and user acquisition programs should be handled by the DAO. In this case the protocol will be competitive due to proper distribution of powers.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
Full Reimbursement
I believe that in the case of a hack, developers should prioritize refunds to their investors and users. If developers do not do so, they not only harm their community, but also undermine overall trust in cryptocurrencies and DeFi, which is unacceptable to members of our community. Moreover, it is a well-known fact that Fei Protocol developers had such an opportunity but chose to earn money themselves rather than reimburse the funds. This is unacceptable and we should condemn such actions.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Regarding the overall goals of a DAO, they can vary depending on the specific DAO and its members. Some common goals may include promoting decentralization, transparency, and community-driven decision-making. Other goals may be more specific to the DAO’s purpose, such as supporting a particular blockchain ecosystem or promoting a specific use case for decentralized technology.
In terms of liquidity mining, this is a strategy that many DAOs use to incentivize liquidity providers to supply liquidity to their platform. The goal of liquidity mining is typically to increase trading volume and liquidity on the platform, which can in turn attract more users and generate revenue for the DAO. The aggressiveness of liquidity mining strategies can vary depending on the specific goals of the DAO and its risk tolerance.
As for issues that have been raised in other communities, it would depend on the specific issues being discussed. However, some common issues that have been raised in the past include concerns around governance and decision-making processes within DAOs, regulatory compliance, security risks, and scalability challenges.

However, the proposal was met with controversy due to concerns over the level of control that Flipside Crypto would have over the allocation of UNI tokens, which are the native token of the Uniswap platform. Some members of the Uniswap community felt that giving Flipside Crypto too much control over the program could potentially lead to centralization and undermine the principles of decentralization that underpin Uniswap.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Despite these concerns, Uniswap ultimately decided to move forward with the bounty program in partnership with Flipside Crypto. However, they made some changes to the original proposal in order to address some of the concerns raised by the community. For example, they reduced the amount of UNI tokens that would be allocated to Flipside Crypto for their role in overseeing the program
Against
The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. On one hand, centralization of authority can lead to more efficient decision-making and implementation of policies. On the other hand, it can also lead to a lack of diversity in perspectives and a concentration of power that can be easily abused.
To approach this tradeoff, it is important to consider the specific context and goals of the organization or project in question. In the case of Flipside, their goal was to create an allocation committee that could effectively distribute funds to different projects within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In this context, having a centralized committee with clear decision-making authority may have been necessary to ensure that funds were distributed fairly and efficiently.
Split Reimbursement
Regarding the question of whether parties should be reimbursed for an exploit, it would depend on the specific circumstances of the situation. However, in general, full reimbursement may not be appropriate.
Firstly, if a party knowingly exploited a system or engaged in fraudulent behavior to gain an advantage, they should not be reimbursed. This would only incentivize unethical behavior and undermine the integrity of the electoral process.
Secondly, even if the exploit was unintentional, parties have a responsibility to ensure the security and accuracy of their campaign activities. If they failed to take reasonable precautions or neglected to address known vulnerabilities, they should bear some responsibility for any negative consequences that result.
That being said, there may be situations where partial reimbursement could be appropriate. For example, if a party was unaware of a vulnerability and promptly reported it to authorities once discovered, they may deserve some compensation for their cooperation in resolving the issue.
Languages I speak and write: English
Disclosure of conflicts of interest is an important aspect of governance in any ecosystem. It helps to ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of the community and not influenced by personal gain. In the context of the Arbitrum ecosystem, conflicts of interest may arise when delegates have a financial or personal stake in a particular decision.
To address this issue, the Arbitrum team has implemented a code of conduct that requires delegates to disclose any conflicts of interest they may have.

DeFi development and ecosystem on Arbitrum
Improving real Governance participation

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO
We believe that the Arbitrum DAO should primarily focus on two areas:

Supporting the development of new and needed applications
Helping onboard new users who would benefit from the applications on Arbitrum

As a project that is aiming to solve some of the fundamental problems in defi surrounding value. Brinc.fi is looking to onboard massive user adoption by creating real intrinsic value for users via its yield vaults exclusively on Arbitrum.
Sample Voting Issue 1

Against
This proposal is asking for UNI tokens from treasury to be deployed to generate yield. I would reject this proposal as it looks like a plan to generate additional income from existing treasury without providing enough information on exactly what the yield forecast is and how it will actually be achieved. In the proposal they “assume” a 30% APR rather than providing data and analyses on how the 30% would be generated i.e. historical yield rates.
As an alternative to deploying UNI to external defi apps to generate yield, I would propose that UNI increase its LP fees on users so that it is generating real yield.

Sample Voting Issue 2
The first vote should have triggered a trustless execution of the hack repayment. It’s unclear what to do after two such votes when neither had executable code tied to their outcomes. Thus, we would never put such a monumental vote to governance without the executable code attached.
The reimbursement amount should be determined by the token holders as they have the long term interest of the project in mind. If executable code had been attached to the first vote, they would have fully reimbursed the hack victims. If token holders directly voted for this code to be executed, it would have been the right outcome.
Our Response: Full Reimbursement
Given that the DAO had the funds to repay the victims it should do so immediately. Also, the first vote should not have been overturned to the detriment of the victims; this goes against the immutability for DAO votes. The first vote should have also triggered a trustless execution of the hack repayment. I feel that significant changes should have been made to the executive committee at FEI as they did not handle their ICO nor this hack with proper diligence and execution.

While we believe that liquidity mining can be a useful tool in certain cases, we do not necessarily view it as the primary goal of us. Our focus is on building and supporting robust, decentralized projects for the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty


How would you vote?
For.
I share the idea that delegation of voting power is necessary for any DAO to function efficiently in the long term
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I would suggest amending a bit.

First, I believe that the grants should be separated into quarterly distributions rather than being divided into Year 1 and Year 2. While I understand that half of the allocation was going to employing staff and they would prefer to have the reserve upfront, I think it would be wiser to have more frequent distributions to ensure greater accountability and oversight.
Secondly, I would recommend introducing checkpoints across the delegation period to ensure that the DAO is comfortable with the allocation and to encourage increased accountability and accountability reports from the grantee. This would involve routine votes to review the progress of the program and to ensure that the allocation is being used in accordance with the DAO’s objectives.
Overall, these amendments would help to increase transparency and accountability while still allowing for efficient delegation of voting power within the DAO.
Overall, these amendments would help to increase transparency and accountability while still allowing for efficient delegation of voting power within the DAO.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
This is a complex issue that requires careful consideration.
On the one hand, centralization can allow for quicker decision-making and more efficient execution of tasks. On the other hand, a more decentralized approach may be preferable, such as in situations where broad participation and input from stakeholders is needed to achieve long-term sustainability.
Ultimately, the specific approach will depend on the specific situation and the goals of the organization or project.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Split reimbursement may be the most reasonable option to consider. Users trust the protocol with their savings, and if it is hacked, a lack of reimbursement would be unethical. However, the amount of reimbursement should be carefully evaluated based on the extent to which the protocol was affected by the hack, as well as the operational costs required for the protocol to survive.

DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

The Arbitrum DAO should be growth-oriented in choosing to build and work with partners that are going to bring users, transactions, and volume to the ecosystem. Rather than distributing the tokens for the sake of distributing them, liquidity mining should occur in extremely targeted ways and spend then as wisely as possible.
Arbitrum already has products that people care about, and traction that other chains cannot follow. The launching of the $ARB token would be an opportunity to bring more users and more products that could integrate themselves with the already-existing infrastructure. These money legos will prove themselves the potential to build a castle, and only with that goal in mind should Arbitrum enable its voters to delegate and vote with the newly-launched token.


Sample Voting Issue 1:


Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.


How would you vote?

For


What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

There are two approaches that could be taken to build consensus: (1) add additional third parties to the allocation and Oversight committees, or (2) reduce the funding for the program with the understanding that it will be increased if the program is successful. The first option reduces the reliance on one partner, while the second option would allow the partner to show they are good stewards and should be trusted to have more control.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is not practical to have a DAO vote on every matter, so some centralization of authority is necessary at some level. The DAO can provide some limited authority to committees that allow them to spend up to a certain level, engage with new partners, take emergency actions, etc. Committees are ultimately accountable to the DAO and the authorities and funding for a committee or project should reflect that.

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?

Full Reimbursement
No Reimbursement
Split Reimbursement


While proactive security measures are always preferable to being hacked and losing funds, history has shown that attacks and hacks have become as more cunning and clever as the security measures have become. The protocol that loses the users’ funds is ultimately responsible for that loss and should work to reimburse users.
However, full and immediate reimbursement may not always be in the best interests of the protocol, depending on the amount of funds lost. One possibility is to reimburse affected users over time, so the damage to the viability of the protocol is limited.
By taking a balanced approach, projects can demonstrate their commitment to their users while also reinforcing the importance of risk management in the DeFi space.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
eg — how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
How aggressive should we be in liquidity mining and what is the goal of the DAO:
As an experienced member and co-founder of several DAOs across various fields, ranging from DeFi to NFT Marketplaces, I have observed that the level of aggressiveness with which a DAO should engage in liquidity mining their token largely depends on their goal. Therefore, I believe that the primary goal of any DAO should be to remain adaptable and responsive to the ever-evolving needs of the user base of the L2, including companies building on top of the decentralized protocols and the protocols themselves.
Given this stated goal, an aggressive liquidity mining strategy is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it can help attract early adopters, incentivize liquidity provision, and create a positive feedback loop that drives adoption and usage of the protocol. Additionally, it can provide a liquidity cushion for the DAO in case of market volatility, which is particularly relevant in the current DeFi landscape.
Moreover, an aggressive liquidity mining strategy can increase the token’s visibility and value proposition in the market, which can lead to higher trading volumes and liquidity on exchanges. This can ultimately lead to more opportunities for the DAO to collaborate and form partnerships, thus increasing the overall utility of the protocol and the potential for future growth.
In summary, an aggressive liquidity mining strategy is crucial to achieve the primary goal of a DAO, which is to remain adaptable and responsive to the needs of the user base. It can attract early adopters, provide liquidity cushions, increase visibility and value proposition, and ultimately lead to more opportunities for growth and collaboration.
On the flip side while an aggressive liquidity mining strategy can have numerous benefits, it is important to carefully consider the potential pitfalls and risks associated with such a strategy. Token dilution, market distortions, short-term speculative investors, and centralization are all potential challenges that need to be taken into account when implementing a liquidity mining program.
It will be important to really understand market sentiment once the token has been out in the wild for awhile but I think aggressive in our current market is the way to go unless something radically changes.

Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
I would choose to handle this situation with a Split Reimbursement approach. This decision is based on the following factors:

Financial sustainability: A full reimbursement may not be feasible for the long-term financial health of the project. It is essential to strike a balance between compensating affected parties and ensuring the project’s sustainability. A split reimbursement can help maintain this balance by compensating a portion of the losses, making it less burdensome on the project’s resources.
Shared responsibility: In the world of decentralized finance, users should be aware of the risks involved in participating in these platforms. While projects should strive to ensure the highest level of security, users must also understand that there is no absolute guarantee against exploits and hacks. A split reimbursement recognizes this shared responsibility, compensating users without creating a moral hazard.
Encourage better security practices: Partial reimbursement can serve as a reminder to users and the project team to remain vigilant in securing their assets and continually improving security measures. This approach helps create a sense of accountability for all parties involved.
Case-by-case basis: A split reimbursement approach allows for flexibility in determining the appropriate reimbursement level for each specific situation. Factors such as the severity of the exploit, the project’s financial state, and user behavior can be taken into consideration to decide the most suitable reimbursement percentage.

In conclusion, a split reimbursement approach balances the need for compensation with financial sustainability and encourages better security practices in the decentralized finance ecosystem. By evaluating each case individually, it is possible to make fair decisions that take into account the unique circumstances",1128

Two areas I’m most interested in are:

DeFi development on Arbitrum
and
Improving Governance participation

My Delegate statement
From my participation in the governance of many crypto projects, I drew several conclusions:

Delegating voting power from centralized teams to thousands of users worldwide gives them great power.
I have been actively participating in the governance of many crypto projects - Optimism, Stargate, Shell Protocol, AAVE, Lido, Goldfinch, 1inch, Gitcoin, CowSwap, and Hashflow.

Conclusion 1: The protocols with more equally distributed voting power allow truly decentralized governance and are more transparent in the decision-making.

The users must fully realize the great responsibility the protocols give them by mechanisms of governance.
Since being actively involved in the decentralized crypto space since September 2021, I have examined and voted on more than 100+ proposals in the abovementioned protocols.

Conclusion2: Delegation of the Voting Power alone will only benefit protocol if Delegates vote regularly and deliberately.
As Arbitrum Delegate, I would study each proposal and vote on it with all my best knowledge.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

Against. It is much easier to transition from decentralization to centralization than vice versa.
I would propose an amendment limiting the number of seats (something like ""one entity should not get more than 20% of the seats).
My approach is to make another vote with an explanation of the pros and cons of these decisions.

(Similar case happened in the Stargate DAO in January 2023. The community decided on one entity’s OTC purchase of STG tokens, which could be financially lucrative but not necessarily beneficial for the protocol’s development.)
Sample Voting Issue 2:
I prefer the Split Reimbursement method*.* Such big hacks undermine the stability of the protocol, and there should be a compromise between users and the protocol and further search for solutions.

Issue Overview 

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

In this case, it seems that there were concerns about centralization of power and the favoritism of one analytics service provider, Flipside, in the Uniswap bounty program. Specifically, the allocation and oversight committees had a majority of members from Flipside, which raised concerns about the allocation of UNI tokens and the overall transparency of the program.
To address these concerns, one possible solution could be to increase the representation of other analytics service providers on the committees to ensure a more diverse and decentralized decision-making process. Additionally, implementing a transparent and public system for allocating UNI tokens and overseeing the program could help ensure fairness and prevent any potential abuses of power.
Ultimately, any program that relies on incentives and bounties should prioritize fairness, transparency, and decentralization to ensure that it aligns with the principles of decentralized finance (DeFi) and promotes the growth of the ecosystem.
Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?
Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Based on the concerns raised, I would suggest the following amendments to the proposal:

Increase the number of seats on the allocation committee and oversight committee for other analytics service providers. This would ensure that the program is not favoring one service provider and that there is fair representation from all parties involved.
Decrease the number of seats on the allocation committee for Flipside. While it’s important to have their expertise in the decision-making process, they shouldn’t have an overwhelming amount of power in the allocation of UNI bounties.
Create clear guidelines and criteria for the allocation of UNI bounties. This would ensure that the allocation committee is making decisions based on objective factors rather than personal biases or preferences.
Increase transparency around the program’s decision-making process. This could be achieved through regular reporting and public disclosure of the program’s activities and decisions. This would increase trust in the program and ensure that all parties involved are held accountable.

By implementing these changes, the proposal would address the concerns raised about centralization of power and favoritism towards one service provider. Additionally, it would create a more transparent and fair allocation process that benefits all parties involved.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It’s a complex issue that requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. On the one hand, centralization of authority can lead to quicker decision-making and efficient execution of tasks. On the other hand, it can lead to a concentration of power and potential abuse of that power.
One way to approach this tradeoff is to strive for a balance between centralization and decentralization. This means delegating decision-making power to multiple stakeholders, such as community members, developers, and service providers, and ensuring that no one group has too much control or influence. It’s also important to establish clear guidelines and protocols for decision-making, and to ensure transparency and accountability in the process.
Additionally, it’s important to regularly reassess the distribution of decision-making power and adjust as necessary. As the needs and dynamics of the ecosystem evolve, so too should the governance structure. This requires ongoing dialogue and collaboration among stakeholders to ensure that the system remains fair, efficient, and effective.

Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
The first step would be to assess the circumstances of the hack, the extent of the damage caused to the affected parties, and the impact on the overall ecosystem.
If it was determined that the hack was a result of a vulnerability in the smart contract or protocol, steps would need to be taken to address the vulnerability and prevent future hacks. This could involve updating the smart contract code, conducting a security audit, or implementing additional security measures.
In terms of reimbursing those affected by the hack, it would be important to ensure that the reimbursement process is fair and transparent. This could involve setting up a process to verify the extent of the damage suffered by each affected party and determining an appropriate amount of reimbursement based on that.
In general, it would be important to prioritize the security and integrity of the ecosystem, while also taking into account the needs and interests of the affected parties. It may also be helpful to engage with the broader community and seek input and feedback on how to best address the situation.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:

My main concern is project development and ensuring that everything is being done to secure the network from internal and external security threats. I would like to see this project focus on providing blockchain solutions like lower gas fees, speedy and secure transactions. I would like it to create dAPPs that allow people to swap tokens across all chains cheaply and securely. I would also like to be able to stake or liquid stake my tokens like people are able to do on LIDO and to farm my tokens as well.

Sample Voting Issue 1:

I would vote no on this proposal
I don’t think that any amendment could make this proposal better.
I agree with this solution reputational avatars , which solves most if not all DAO participation and token-weight voting problems.

Sample Voting Issue 2:
This depends on where the reimbursement funds are going to be drawn from.

My interests: 1) Public Goods funding 2) IRL Arbitrum community gatherings
DAOs have multiple goals and objectives, and these goals can evolve over time as the project matures and the needs of the community change. Ultimately, the goals of a DAO should align with the project’s mission and values and be driven by the needs and interests of the community. Therefore, I would answer briefly - my views as a potential delegate should be focused on such things as the desire of the entire DAO community, as well as acting in the best interests of the project as a whole.
Voting issue first:
1) I would vote against
2) The Uniswap project is supposed to be built on the principles of decentralization, transparency, and fairness, and any proposed amendments should align with these principles. For example, the allocation and oversight committees should be composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, and other analytics service providers should be involved in the proposal to avoid favoritism towards one provider.
3) Project’s values are centered around decentralization and community-driven decision-making. As such, any decision regarding the proposal should aim to preserve and enhance these values. It is essential to ensure that the Uniswap community is involved in decision-making, and that there is transparency and accountability in the allocation of UNI bounties.
Voting issue 2:
1) Full Reimbursement
My decision is based on the principle of protecting users and restoring trust in the project. Full reimbursement would signal to users that the project takes security seriously and is willing to take responsibility for its shortcomings. Additionally, it could help to mitigate the financial losses incurred by those affected by the hack and prevent a loss of confidence in the project’s ability to protect user funds.
However, full reimbursement would also come with its own risks and challenges. It could set a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to further exploitation or abuse by bad actors. It could also pose significant financial challenges to the project, potentially limiting its ability to continue operating in the long term.
Therefore, while full reimbursement may be an option in some cases, DAOs must carefully consider the specific circumstances of the hack and the potential risks and benefits of each option before making a decision. Ultimately, the goal should be to protect users, promote the long-term sustainability of the project, and maintain the trust and confidence of the project’s stakeholders.
Languages: English, Ukrainian, Russian
Conflict of interest: I believe that it is critical for all delegates to operate with the DAO’s best interest in mind and disclose any potential conflicts of interest that may arise. Transparency and integrity are essential to the success of any governance process, and the disclosure of conflicts of interest is an important part of ensuring that the process is fair and equitable for all stakeholders involved.",1134

DAO is an ecosystem design driven by incentive cycle to perpetuate a service as a protocol for society.
Therefore, all the decision makings must not disrupt the incentive cycle.
Also, all the participants have to understand the principle of self-responsibility.
Sample Voting Issue 1:


Against


While this proposal sets out reasonable objectives and means to achieve them, there are ambiguities about committee decision-making and execution, so we should add information that can resolve the following questions:
a. How many seats is necessary for making decision in Allocation Committee?
b. It says token operations will be automated, but what exactly is the Allocation Committee’s Multisig Wallet used for?
c. I think the Oversight Committee’s decision will be made by a 2/3 vote, but it’s natural for Flipside to want to continue, so I think they can make the decision to continue regardless of the outcome just by persuading or buying vote from either Nic or Boris, so why not increase the number?
d. Is Flipside’s process for determining bounty winners centralized?
e. Flipside is expected to provide the analysis on which the Oversight Committee will base its discussion, but is there any room for fraud in this analysis?


I think it is fundamental to design services so that the centralized elements and its risks can be monitored publicly. In the case of this proposal, if we need to monitor the process of any possible fraud within Flipside’s services, we should make clear the logic for visualize all the analysis results applied for the bounty program and the process for determining the winner.


Sample Voting Issue 2:
Ans. 3 Split Reimbursement
Basically, I believe that the use of DeFi should adopt the principle of self-responsibility, so I believe that these victims should also be held accountable for their losses. On the other hand, DeFi is also an application, so we understand that customer compensation is necessary from a credit acquisition perspective. The key here is not to disrupt the Tokenomics in the refund process, and the policy of splitting it up and refunding it over time is not so bad.

Public Goods funding
DeFi development on Arbitrum

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
Liquidity mining is a process where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity to a particular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol or platform. It involves users depositing tokens into a liquidity pool, which is then used to facilitate trades on the platform. In return, users are given rewards in the form of additional tokens or other incentives.
The level of aggression in liquidity mining should be determined based on an individual’s risk tolerance and investment goals. It’s important to understand the risks involved in liquidity mining, such as impermanent loss and market volatility, and to carefully assess the potential rewards.
The goal of a DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is to create a community-driven, decentralized governance structure. DAOs are designed to be transparent, open, and democratic, allowing members to participate in decision-making processes and have a say in the direction of the organization. The specific goals of a DAO can vary widely depending on the community it serves, but typically include promoting the adoption of a particular blockchain technology, developing new decentralized applications, or creating new financial instruments that are accessible to a wider audience.
As for the issues raised in other communities, without more specific context it’s difficult for me to comment. However, DAOs and DeFi platforms are still relatively new and rapidly evolving, and it’s important for communities to actively engage in constructive dialogue and collaboration to address any concerns and promote the growth of the ecosystem.

3.The tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done is a common challenge for any organization, including DAOs. On one hand, centralization of authority can provide clear leadership and decision-making, leading to faster execution and more efficient use of resources. On the other hand, too much centralization can stifle innovation, limit participation, and lead to decision-making that does not reflect the needs and priorities of the wider community.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The purpose of governance for the Arbitrum DAO is to enable community members to collectively make decisions about the future direction and management of the Arbitrum network. As a group, we are responsible for managing the development, maintenance, and upgrades of the Arbitrum network - and for its affects on the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.
Through our governance activity, we community members of the Arbitrum DAO must propose and vote on changes to the network’s protocol, such as upgrades or improvements to the smart contract language, transaction fees, and other key parameters.
In addition to technical decisions, the Arbitrum DAO’s governance process should also address broader strategic issues, such as network expansion, partnerships, and community outreach. Ultimately, the goal of the Arbitrum DAO’s governance process is to ensure that the network remains secure, reliable, and accessible to all users while also growing and evolving to meet the changing needs of our stakeholders.
Sample Voting Issue 1 - UniSwap/Flipside Bounty
How would you vote?
For
It has been my personal experience, contributing to various DAOs, that operational effectiveness relies upon a DAO community’s willingness and ability to safely and routinely delegate power to committees of trusted individuals. Centralization is not our ideal, however so long as such delegations of power are made with clearly defined mandates, limitations, oversight, and duration it is something I support.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Add a change management process to handle alterations to the committee composition as a result of DAO vote, normal turnover, illness, etc.
Smaller time-periods. This committee should have a 1-year mandate and should be responsible for quarterly oversight rather than yearly. Community should vote to renew after 1 year, or to make alterations to the mandate.
Mandate for reporting on a quarterly basis.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The ultimate vision for DAO governance is fully transparent, 24/7 onchain governance. However, with the current tools we have this is not possible for nearly any DAO or protocol. In the short term, reliance on centralization of authority in the form of DAO-voted empowerment of individuals or committees to pursue the DAO’s interests and goals is an acceptable compromise.
In order to make this compromise safe for a DAO it is important to have good-governance principles enshrined in whatever structure governs the individuals or committees voted into power - including time limits on the empowerments made. Nothing should ever be forever, except immutable code.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - Rari Hack Reinbursement
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)
Split Reimbursement
Whether or not victims of the Rari Finance hack should have been reimbursed for their losses is a complex question that depends on several factors, including the terms of use and service agreements of the Rari Finance platform and the specific circumstances surrounding the hack.
In general, DeFi platforms like Rari Finance and those that operate within the Ethereum and Arbitrum DeFi ecosystems, operate in a largely self-regulated environment, and other DAOs, protocols, and users are typically responsible for their own security and risk management. Therefore, it is not necessarily the responsibility of the platform to reimburse users for losses resulting from hacks or other security incidents.
That being said, it is both ethical and the operational best practice for DeFi platforms to have established insurance funds or other mechanisms to compensate users in the event of losses due to hacks or other security incidents. Insurance products for users did exist at the time, most notably via Nexus Mutual. So users affected by the hack did have the opportunity to mitigate their risk through purchase of cover. However, it is my personal belief that Rari Finance did not have adequate best practices in place and that its users were entitled to feel mislead as to the safety of using the protocol.
Regardless, users of a protocol governed by a DAO must accept the decisions of that DAO’s governance process - or participate themselves in order to advocate for their own preferences or interests. This is the only way to resolve such disputes. I would advocate for partial-reimbursement to be considered via DAO governance and ultimately hope that the DAO agreed that it bore some responsibility.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to reimburse victims of the Rari Finance hack would be up to the platform’s management team and/or community governance structure. They would need to weigh the potential benefits of reimbursing victims, such as maintaining the platform’s reputation and retaining users, against the potential costs, such as setting a precedent for future reimbursement requests and the financial burden of compensating victims.

Public Goods funding
Tooling, Improving protocol decentralization
Improving Governance participation
Supporting Infrastructure

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The Arbitrum ecosystem has seen significant growth and participation from active DeFi users, which has led to deep liquidity in the protocol. As a delegate in the ecosystem, my goal would be to focus on projects and builders that can ease DeFi participation for average users, rather than solely relying on liquidity mining strategies to attract DeFi natives.
While liquidity mining can be an effective way to attract users and liquidity, it can also lead to inefficiencies and slow down progressive decentralization. Instead, my focus as a delegate would be on primitives that can onboard non-DeFi native users to maintain the growth of the ecosystem.
Some of the key areas that I would prioritize include de-risking of IL, which can help to reduce the potential losses for users in the ecosystem. Additionally, I would focus on proposals that can ease user-journey via one-click batch transactions, one-sided staking initiatives, liquidity book and dAMM scalability, KPI-based reputation and funding systems, and other user-centric features.
By focusing on these areas, we can ensure that the Arbitrum ecosystem continues to grow and attract a diverse range of users and use cases. This will not only increase the overall value of the ecosystem but also help to promote greater decentralization and resilience over time.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
1. How would you vote?
Before voting I would like to understand the roadmap in detail; success metrics, if the team is willing to be flexible to further decentralize the reward distribution process, and especially if they are willing to work with other service providers if they were to reach out for support.
In this particular case, as a delegate, I would vote “AGAINST” the Uniswap proposal as it currently stands, since I don’t see any roadmap to what it is that will be delivered, what are the success metrics/KPIs of those deliveries, who are accountable for ensuring the success of the project, and what is the roadmap to progressively decentralize the accumulated distribution power moving forward.
2. What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I’d like to see a pretty clear explanation of the roadmap and understand if they are planning to decentralize after PoC’ing the proposal and I would ensure those are stated for the community more clearly.
In general, I would most likely vote for proposals that have clear asks for milestone-based or KPI-based funding, which ensures trust and accountability.
3. How would you approach the tradeoff between the centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
Decentralization is not just an end goal, but an ongoing process of collaboration and coordination among different nodes in a network. I believe the process can be implemented to get things done while ensuring the decentralization at the set standards by the community. Building a culture of accountability will enable a maturity level growth for the entire ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
I was paying attention to the situation when it was occurring and even during those times I was weighing the options of Full Reimbursement versus Split Reimbursement. During those times, given the political climate within the Fei/Rari/Tribe ecosystem, I would’ve advocated for Full Reimbursement for the following reasons:
1. The presence of centralized and potentially malicious actors exerting significant influence on the voting process.
2. The misalignment of core-builder teams, resulted in diminished motivation to develop and deliver on their project commitments.
3. The importance of respecting the outcomes of past proposals, as this is crucial for maintaining a well-functioning governance system.

Delegate Statement
Blockchain at Berkeley is a student organization at UC Berkeley that has been founded since 2014. We actively participate in governance on Aave, Compound, dYdX, Optimism, and Uniswap and we are expanding our governance focus to more protocols. We are experienced in on-chain governance and protocol design and we are very interested in the Arbitrum ecosystem. In 2022, UC Berkeley was ranked by CoinDesk as the #1 university to study blockchain in the United States and #3 in the world.
We believe that a fast-growing protocol needs a diverse team of delegates and continuous nourishment of the next generation of designers, developers, educators, and entrepreneurs. Blockchain at Berkeley is in a perfect position to supply talent from the student community to study the latest updates on Arbitrum, to foster engagement, to introduce learners to Arbitrum, and to build on Arbitrum!
In the past, we created a proposal(Compound #89) to lower the minimum proposing threshold on Compound to increase inclusivity for proposal creation. For more about our justifications for our governance votes, please check our Twitter!
Blockchain at Berkeley has departments including consulting for leading web3 projects, blockchain education on edX, blockchain accelerator program, and research. Our governance department is in charge of protocol research and voting and. We dedicate at least one lead to each protocol and include all governance members to make decisions on all proposals. The governance department meets weekly to discuss the latest updates and presents analysis on proposals and we ensure voices of all members are considered before making a decision. The voting process within the department is democratic to balance knowledge from seasoned members and thoughts from younger members.
We appreciate your consideration for us to be your delegate. We believe that our experience and dedication will greatly complement the other participants in the Arbitrum governance ecosystem. We are always happy to go in depth with decision making and analysis so you can be assured that your delegation is efficient in the system.

Overall Goals for the DAO
Sample Voting Issue 1 - Uniswap and Flipside Crypto:
How would you vote?
For. We believe this proposal has great potential to enrich the Uniswap community with useful tools to navigate the complex AMM landscape on V3. Further, we appreciate this proposal’s strategic approach that allows Uniswap-native mechanisms to generate the usable funds in this proposal can serve as a model for future grants.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
The main gripe we had with this proposal was the lack of competition allowed for the role of service provider. We believe that if there was a competitive aspect to this proposal where multiple service providers could bid for the right to run this program, it could have been much better.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
While we recognize the fundamental value of decentralization, we also believe that there this proposal strikes a good balance between having Uniswap remaining largely decentralized and improving the ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 2 - FEI Rari Hack Reimbursement
How would you vote?
No Reimbursement
As previous delegates for the FEI protocol, Calblockchain voted no reimbursement on a related proposal(TIP-112).
Our reasoning was as follows:
We don’t believe this is the proper use of PCV. Fei needs all the defenses necessary, and shouldn’t be responsible for repaying the complete sum of Rari losses during an unprecedented market downturn. Rari positions carry smart contract risk, and while we believe in a future where Rari can provide compensation to users who lost out from a hack, it’s an unwise choice to put the stable coin at risk for complete repayment. Falling collateralization to ~120% is not an option: Fei still has exposure to stEth, and repayement would primarily reduce exposure to stablecoins (90% → 70%). This risk portfolio is not safe in any market, especially this one. We support alternative solutions to repay hack-affected users - such as a safety staking pool - but do not support the use of PCV to repay for the attack. Fei peg is of the highest priority to us.
We still believe that this was the right stance to take, even after a different proposal for full repayment of the Rari hack passed. As we all know, FEI protocol shut down shortly after and the reduction to PCV was a large reason why. PCV was not meant to act as a backstop and thus we have never considered it to be a backstop.

short term: Gaming development on Arbitrum, since it will pull in a lot of people that will then expand their experience into the whole ecosystem. Masses go always the fun way the easiest.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
A DAO is a structure used to give the many a voice by making governance accessible and transparent. Therefore it forms a strong community of individuals that be part of something big.
Liquidity mining is a proven strategy to bootstrap a DeFi ecosystem. However, the aggressiveness of liquidity mining strategy should be carefully evaluated to make sure it aligns with the DAO’s overall goals and financial sustainability.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
The D in DAO stand for “decentralized” so the answer should be clear.
If you give individuals too much power they tend to play the game selfish. It is what it is.
On the other hand maybe you want to give good players enough power to push positive developments faster, but still this distribution of power should be subject of the DAO itself.
Sample Voting Issue 2:

how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining
When it comes to liquidity mining, am all for strategic implementation that balances user acquisition and sustained growth. As we have seen, Liquidity mining plays a crucial role in attracting users to Ecosystems/DeFi platforms. However, it’s essential to implement it strategically to ensure long-term sustainability and avoid negative consequences like short-term, yield-chasing behavior and unsustainable token emissions.
Key considerations for a strategic approach to liquidity mining may include:
 → Gradually tapering rewards to encourage long-term commitment and discourage short-term behavior.
 → Offering targeted incentives for specific pools or token pairs to prioritize strategic partnerships and attract committed users.
 → Involving users in governance and decision-making processes to foster a sense of ownership and loyalty.
 → Continuously monitoring and adapting liquidity mining programs to balance user acquisition and long-term sustainability.
By adopting a strategic approach, the DAO can leverage liquidity mining to build a strong foundation for lasting success.

Stance on Voting Issues:

UniSwap/Flipside Bounty: Against
I would vote against the proposed UniSwap/Flipside Bounty. While I acknowledge the importance of democratic decision-making, I believe that the particular approach in this proposal may not be the most effective way. Instead, I would advocate for a more structured and collaborative approach that fosters meaningful engagement among community members and encourages diverse opinions while still maintaining an efficient decision-making process.

Rari Hack Reimbursement: For
I believe in full reimbursement for affected parties in cases where a bug or exploit has caused significant losses. It is crucial to maintain customer trust and ensure the platform’s long-term success. However, the extent of the reimbursement should be determined based on the severity of the loss and the exploit’s impact. Additionally, it is essential to implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

A DAO represents one of the first company-like structures that prioritizes distributing control rather than concentrating it. In our opinion, the key objective of a DAO is to maintain this decentralized manner, striving for a fully or nearly fully distributed structure.
It can be argued that additional activities, such as fostering a robust community, offering a platform for constructive discussions, and enabling profit through liquidity mining, are the byproducts stemming from the establishment of a decentralized DAO.
While Arbitrum may profit from engaging in liquidity mining, the intensity of this approach depends on the overall risk tolerance of the Arbitrum DAO. Boiler Blockchain, being a DAO itself, cannot accurately determine the exact risk appetite for Arbitrum’s DAO. Nevertheless, if the community opts to pursue liquidity mining, the DAO should maintain maximum transparency and openness (e.g., disclosing the percentage of the treasury allocated for liquidity mining, the expenses or tokens awarded to project users participating in the $ARB pool, etc).

Issue Overview 1.3k

Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralization of power and favor of one service provider.

Prompts to Answer:

How would you vote?
For

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

The proposal needs to consider two factors: committee structure, and the value of the proposal itself. Based on the proposal, Uniswap will rely heavily on Flipside to manage the payout of $UNI for bounties. However, this would pose a problem since Flipside would have a 4/10 or 2/5 voting power of the total $25M.
This exact problem is another common dilemma the DeFi community faces. We believe that lack of competition is the issue here. If there were multiple service providers that would bid on the right to attain a position to control this program, it could have been a much better situation overall.
A possible solution to the lack of competition while being dependent on Flipside to be the “major” decision maker is to reduce its voting power to a maximum of 1/3 of the total seats available. This could mean that Flipside would have 2/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the oversight committee.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

Centralization eases the decision-making process by coordinating and implementing changes quickly, but more often than not it can lead to a concentration of power and lack of transparency. On the contrary, decentralization promotes transparency and a democratic decision making process, but may lead to difficulty in coordination and implementations effectively.
We could suggest that introducing another step in the voting process could be effective. In this approach, significant proposals (such as public goods funding or liquidity mining) would undergo a two-step voting process:

A standard delegation phase, where voting power correlates with the number of tokens held by a user, and;
A unique round, during which each user receives only one protocol token.

By implementing this dual-phase voting system, the likelihood of a significant holder exerting undue influence on the vote is minimized, whilst still maintaining optimal efficiency.
Ultimately, there is no best all-in-one approach to tackle this issue. The choice between centralization or decentralization depends on the specific situation, needs, and goals for a community. It is of the utmost importance to be open to feedback and flexible to adapt towards the circumstance.

FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022 Rari was hacked for 80M, a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then in May 2022 another vote to refund the Rari hack was brought forward, this time it was not passed.
Prompts to Answer:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

Full Reimbursement
No Reimbursement
Split Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.

The Fei Protocol/Rari Capital hack reimbursement was a controversial incident. We could argue that Fei should be responsible for the damages caused by what might be a purely unintentional mistake for not following the check-effect-interaction pattern when sending a value to an address. It is the right thing to do and this would certainly make everyone happy. However, we do not agree with the means of reimbursement source since it would place the stablecoin at risk. In addition, affected parties should also be aware of the risk that smart contracts pose.
While we believe that the team has done the calculations that would both compensate the user and maintain protocol longevity, we would agree for full reimbursement only if the payment method is replaced (i.e. % of fees given to users weekly; or anything that does not use Fei’s stablecoin operation lifeline). Otherwise, it’s just a short term solution that leads to a long term problem.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
I strongly believe in decentralization, especially in DeFi and crypto. Crypto empowers stakeholders to govern and steer without external authority, enabling individuals to create wealth-generating apps, service projects, and life-changing/saving protocols like the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Although only a small fraction of the world’s population is currently invested in crypto, I believe that its benefits should not be limited to the wealthy. On the contrary, I see crypto as a powerful tool for underprivileged and developing countries. Crypto can serve as a means of payment helping to solve many problems. It is essential to give back to the community and help those in need, whether through financial support, knowledge, or services, and empower them to help themselves.
As mentioned earlier, I believe that connecting with the brilliant minds supporting crypto and the Arbitrum ecosystem could accelerate progress. Therefore, I as a delegate, I would fully endorse a governance system made up of socially-minded individuals with expertise in finance and the future of the world. This system would improve communication, service development, platform development, and project onboarding. It would also facilitate the sharing of assets and services with the public and handle crisis management if necessary.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

How would you vote?
For
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
I think the proposed partnership with Flipside would move away from decentralization and towards a more centralized structure, giving too much control to a single entity. The fight for the few available seats showed that the proposal was benefiting privileged stakeholders of Flipside. As a delegate, I would modify the proposal to include more than one partner or allow Uniswap to veto allocation decisions and require Flipside to regularly provide proof of work. Uniswap governance will review the work and performance and vote on whether to continue working with Flipside or determine the next steps.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done? Ensuring decentralization is the main purpose of web3, but during the current building stage, we may need to make centralized decisions to achieve a decentralized future. Centralized decisions should only be made as a last resort and for the future of decentralization. Balancing this is challenging, but we must delegate some authority in good faith until it is no longer necessary.
Since this is a new space, everyone is taking risks while building and creating, including users who are trying to profit from the protocols. While web3 projects/companies can offer refunds if they choose to, it is not the responsibility of the protocol, however if there was a fault with Arbitrums code, which was found to be the reason for the layer 3 exploit, there should be a remedy, which would need to be considered. The remedy should not be at the detriment of the treasury and the Arbitrum community

Broadly speaking to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem through sustainable methods and decisions. Thanks to the DAO receiving sequencer revenue, Arbitrum DAO already has sustainable revenue streams coming in. Key considerations I’ll be making when voting are: will  this create a meaningful increase in sequencer revenue, user onboarding, the impact of token emissions, and development of consumer centric applications that will result in an increase of important chain metrics.

I would vote AGAINST
Amendments I’d make: I would either remove the student organizations from these allocation committees or expand them to include groups who I think better represent the interests of the ecosystem. I personally believe too much governance power is given to elite institutions which seems counter to decentralization.
Flipside as a single analytics company has too much power in the proposal as is. I would suggest removing 2 of Flipsides seats on the allocation committee and giving 1 to Dune Analytics and another to the Graph. The oversight committee should also be expanded to just beyond analytics companies in the ecosystem as to provide some check on their actions.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I think authority sits within token holders hands but we need to delegate/vote for representatives on our behalf so things can get done. I’m a strong believer that we do not need to re-invent corporate governance structures. Electing committees/boards with checks and balances in my opinion is the optimal solution for balancing central authority vs the ability to get things done.

Split Reimbursement
Hacks and technical exploits are frequent  occurrence in crypto. While the average smart contract is much safer than it was a few years ago, protocols can find themselves being tested by blackhats and even state level actors. I believe it is important to consider partial reimbursements in most cases, while full reimbursements in most cases likely cause too much damage or inflation to protocols partial reimbursements should at least be considered at times where full dont. I’d also like to suggest protocols educate whales to consider purchases smart contract insurance. Onchain data supports the stance that majority of TVL is usually due to a small number of users, if those users can hedge their risk adequately then protocols can reasonably issue reimbursements when hacks/exploits happen to majority of token holders.

What is a DAO?
A DAO is a community-led organization managed by smart contracts/ off-chain voting, without a central authority. Members make critical decisions such as technical updates and allocations in the treasury by voting on proposals. Alignment of incentives is part of this framework, and members are encouraged to approve proposals that serve the best interests of the protocol.
How does a DAO work?
The rules of a DAO are set by a core team of community members using smart contracts/ off-chain signatures. Funding is usually obtained by issuing tokens/NFTs, and token/NFT holders have proportional voting rights. Once the funding is complete, the DAO is ready for distribution. DAOs can provide grants to various projects and make investments. Voting on these issues depends on the decision of all DAO members, and an effort is made to create a decentralized, transparent, and sustainable environment.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Probably the best thing to do here would be to oppose the proposal but revise it. With the condition of preventing the monopoly of Flipside, it can become possible to provide grants with a more decentralized distribution.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

We want to believe that most organizations in the field are well-intentioned. But you have to look objectively at everything in this field, as we said, we emphasize the decentralization of DAOs but because Uniswap also needs to use its funds to spread to a larger area, we can consider the possibility of this in smaller grants but in larger grants we expect it to be distributed to different analytical firms, different communities, balance the grant distribution, and reduce the control authority to be given.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
Split Reimbursement
The purpose of reimbursement is based on trust and logic. In the FEI RARI hack, if all funds have disappeared and only the governance token is in the treasury, a full refund should definitely not be made because in this case, trying to refund all funds for the victims who have already accepted their risk can result in a bigger disaster.
Therefore, a comprehensive plan should be created for the loss sufferers without victimizing the governance token holders, and a split refund should be made and as we said, you should do this fairly and by preserving the health of the protocol otherwise a full refund does not solve the problem, it complicates things.
Of course, if the protocol is in a situation where it has enough liquid funds to pay the victims, we can certainly expect a refund but whether to pay all the funds or not depends on the situation at the time, if there is not enough liquid fund left in the treasury after the fund paid to the victims, this would not be a very reasonable solution because it would affect the future plans of the protocol, probably the health of the protocol would decrease, and token holders would be victimized.

As the network’s governing body, Arbitrum DAO’s focus should be on supporting programs, designing initiatives, and making decisions that affect the network as a whole, but that are outside of the scope of the individual network participants. The DAO is neither a rule-making nor a rule-enforcing body, and it should have no ability to restrict, control, eliminate, or in any way hinder growth and innovation on the network. Furthermore, it should have no ability to offer incentives in a way that creates an unfair advantage for any individual or individual type of network participant.
The DAO’s activities should be limited to network-wide improvements in the form of infrastructure upgrades, digital “public-goods” and other services, and open, publicly-agreed upon and auditable incentives that are designed to equitably benefit all ecosystem participants as well as attract new participants to the network.
Sample Voting Issue 1:
1.1 Against
1.2 It is clear that the reason for the contention is due to the perception of a conflict of interest, moreso than the value of the Flipside service. As it stands, it certainly seems that the path for Flipside to reach a simple majority is far too easy; they only require one sympathetic vote on both the Allocation and Oversight Committees to pass measures; even in the case that the committees were to behave perfectly ethically, we think there would always be tension created due to the ease with which the vote could be skewed in Flipside’s favor.
In this case, we would recommend reducing Flipside’s representation in the Allocation Committee to no more than 2 out of 5. We would also recommend increasing the Oversight Committee to 5 total members, with Flipside’s representation being no more than 1.
1.3 Decentralization is by no means a requirement for an organization. There are a variety of reasons that an organization may choose to centralize its decision making; as long as the organization is forthright about this, we see no issue. However, if an organization purports itself to be decentralized (or to have a decentralized governance process), then we feel that the organization should adhere to whatever rules and definitions it has put in place for itself.
In general, we feel that the decision whether, and to what degree, an organization relies on its members for making decisions should be well-understood and transparent. Whether this is communicated clearly in the organization’s bylaws, whether it emerges naturally as the result of defining roles for participants within the organization, or whether it is generally understood based on the parameters for making and passing proposals will differ from one organization to the next. In general, however, the level of decentralization should, in most cases, be supported by free market activity of the participants. If, for example, participants feel they are not being represented proportionally in the decision-making process, and do not feel that they have a reasonable avenue for increasing their level of engagement, they should have the right to demonstrate their dissatisfaction by selling tokens and exiting the DAO at any time and without penalty.
Sample Voting Issue 2:
2.1 No Reimbursement
2.2 In general, I’m opposed to refunds or reimbursements following an exploit. In almost all cases, these sorts of reimbursement plans lead to a “race for the exits” among investors anyways, which results in further harm to the protocol and holders; a reimbursement is only a reimbursement for those who manage to sell first.
Part of the reason that crypto investors enjoy such outsized returns is because of the inherent risks involved with deploying capital into nascent, often experimental protocols. Unless it can be proven that a hack is the result of malicious intent on the part of the development team (inside job), then a hack is something for which the team is a victim as well; there should be no expectation that the victims of an exploit compensate other victims of the same exploit.
However, in the event that funds are able to be recovered, every effort should be made to do so, and to compensate the victims of the hack accordingly.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
We would amend the proposal to remove the oversight committee seat (putting it up to a vote from the DAO).
We would also look to give flip side 1 seat on the allocation committee ( as they were running a majority of the infrastructure as per the governance proposal) and have the other two seats be open to other analytics providers by means of a vote.
Flipside could end up being all of the votes but they should be voted in not appointed. A DAO must govern, and these committees should be put on a 12 month revue should things change in community sentiment.
Uniswap is one of the major pillars of DeFi and their investment program is even more important! However no one group should have concentrated power over this fund.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I personally believe that with the proper financial, social, and strategic incentives people can be more or less inclined to “get things done.” Flipside would have received a majority of the traffic for these bounties. Members of the Uniswap DAO should decide if this is sufficient incentive for Flipside.
If it doesn’t end up being enough and flip side does not wish to setup this bounty system with an investment fund. They most likely aren’t the right partner with the DAO and someone will step up to fill that gap. If nobody does in time, the incentives should be reviewed and re-proposed.

Prompts to Answer:

Full Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
We believe that it is always important to return the voice to the members of the DAO. Should the members decide that it is best to reimburse the victims of a hack this is what should occur, without cause for a second vote.
As $FEI was a stable coin I believe that this puts the protocol in a peculiar position. As issuers of the stable-coin I believe that it is your duty to always allow holders of your token to redeem as much value as possible (up to parity) in the event of an attack. Normally I wouldn’t vote to repay the lost funds as this is the inherit risk we choose every day when we enter the world of DeFi. We are pioneers in this new financial space, we profit from the risk we take but are not immune to loses and pitfalls.
In the end it comes down to what the protocol itself stated. Should this be any other DeFi products, take Aave lending pools, Uniswap LPs, or even NFT marketplaces such as Opensea we as their users take on risk.
As we all expected the American government to make depositors whole (one shouldn’t have to worry about depositing cash in a bank! Right?), it is only right that the protocol allows redemptions for the FEI token, and to make users whole.
What they do with the remaining cash is up to the members of the DAO. They can look to also redeem TRIBE tokens for the remainder of the value and sunset the protocol, or look to build back up again, stronger.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
The ArbitrumDAO is tasked with the critical role of sustainably developing and growing the Arbitrum ecosystem while embodying the community values stated in the Constitution.
Liquidity, for example, is a critical factor for any chain/L2, as it benefits all the projects deployed and kickstarts a positive flywheel that attracts more developers, users, and funds.
Traditional forms of liquidity mining, however, have proven to be very short-sighted and to attract only mercenaries. Considering that Arbitrum is already leading the L2 ecosystems in terms of value and liquidity attracted on the chain, smarter mechanisms that use incentives to attract long-term liquidity and to further distribute the governance power can be designed to join sustainability and liquidity targets.

If the choice falls between 2 (or more) protocols where the differences can be attributed to objective factors such as their technology or their values (for example, where one is centralized and the other is focused on trust-minimization), then it’s fair to select only one entity.

I believe a DAO and its protocol are ultimately responsible for the safety of its users.
In case of a hack, it is the responsibility of the DAO to wholly refund users whenever possible, especially in these early stages of the industry.
If treasury funds are not enough to repay users, then new mechanisms can be designed (vesting system, fee-driven refunds) with the objective of creating an income stream for those affected.

E. Stance on “Overall Goals for the Arbitrum DAO”:
The Arbitrum DAO should champion progressive decentralization, echoing our ethos. These are based on the Savvy DAO Guidelines (Commonwealth) where we aim to cultivate an environment where self-regulation thrives through both on-chain and off-chain avenues.

Empower the Community: Emphasize community-driven proposals and voting, ensuring every member feels integral to the DAO’s direction.
Sustainable Incentivization: Prioritize long-term ecosystem growth over traditional liquidity mining, aligning with the broader vision of the Arbitrum chain.
Collaboration Over Competition: Foster synergy and collaboration, leveraging the collective strength of the Arbitrum chain.
Innovation and Technical Excellence: Stay at the cutting edge, from integrating new layers to supporting diverse programming languages.
Holistic Ecosystem Growth: Beyond incentives, focus on projects that contribute to the Arbitrum ecosystem’s comprehensive growth, weighing each decision against its long-term impact.

In essence, the Arbitrum DAO should be a beacon of innovation, growth, and collaboration, inviting all to partake in shaping the future of the Arbitrum chain.

How would you vote?
Against
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
Drawing from the collective insights of the delegates, I’d propose reducing Flipside’s seats on the allocation committee and expanding the oversight committee to five seats, retaining Flipside’s single seat. This ensures a balanced representation without giving undue influence to one entity. Additionally, a staggered rotation for electing members to the committees would be introduced, allowing the community to reassess and make changes as needed.
How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
The essence of a DAO is decentralization. While efficiency is crucial, it shouldn’t come at the cost of centralizing power. Introducing layers of delegation, periodic elections, and activity requirements can strike a balance. Delegation with accountability ensures that while tasks are efficiently executed, the broader community’s interests remain at the forefront.

Full Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
The DAO’s decisions should be binding and consistent. If a vote for reimbursement was ratified, it’s essential to uphold that decision to maintain trust within the community. However, it’s also crucial to set clear precedents. While early adopters and supporters should be protected, it’s vital to ensure that the DAO doesn’t set an expectation of risk-free returns. Compensation mechanisms, like debt-like instruments or vested tokens, can be explored to align long-term interests and ensure the platform’s continued success post-incident.

Savvy DAO’s Disclosure of Conflict(s) of Interest Answer:
Savvy DAO is a decentralized organization with a foundational commitment to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Our operations and growth are deeply intertwined with the success of Arbitrum, and our primary objective is to enhance its decentralized and community-driven nature. As a DAO, our decisions are made through our multisig treasury wallet, which requires a consensus among signers. Furthermore, our vast community of $SVY token holders, who are also active Arbitrum users, play a pivotal role in shaping our stance on various proposals. This is achieved through both formal voting mechanisms and informal community feedback channels. While we are dedicated to the Arbitrum ecosystem, we ensure that our decisions are made without bias and in the best interest of the broader Arbitrum community. We are, first and foremost, representatives of this community.",1163

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
In my opinion, liquidity mining should not be too aggressive since it would lead to increasing the risk and volatility of the token but it would also attract a greater number of large and small users, which would be good for the ecosystem. But on the other hand, it is known that the vast majority of users, with greater short-term profits, begin to get rid of or sell their assets, causing selling pressure. It would be better to impose a decreasing medium-term mining in the long term.
The objective of a DAO is the decentralized and healthy growth of the project, it is to obtain the best innovative, objective ideas that allow us to incorporate and improve the usefulness of the project and determine a decision between everything in a decentralized way.

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
The task I would make is to integrate a longer vesting for the subsidies and a cliff of approximately 6 months followed by an unlocking every 2 months.


How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?
I have been in cryptography since 2017 and it is inevitable to at least have centralization in the DAO since the largest holdings on many occasions push the balance towards their side or towards their interests due to the voting power they entail, but on the other hand the largest holders are Those who also support the ecosystem, have broader knowledge and are more faithful to the objective of the project. In conclusion, the DAO is well established.


Sample Voting Issue 2:
Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
i.e should parties be reimbursed for an exploit or not? (Please choose one of the below options and then elaborate upon your reasoning)

Full Reimbursement
I am inclined towards a full refund because the trust of the community is paramount in any project, apart from that the community members are contributing great value to the project ecosystem by providing the trust and continuity of the project, in case the hacked value can be recovered and In the event that it cannot be recovered or a part of the stolen value can be recovered, a long-term refund would be made with a delivery in years or with a vesting.

DeFi development on Arbitrum
Improving Governance participation

E. Stance on “Overall Goals for the Arbitrum DAO”:
We are happy to see the current programs, such as the Short Term Incentives Program (STIP) and Uniswap-Arbitrum Grants Program (UAGP), and we believe the engagement from both individual community members and organisations during events, such as the DAO Day calls, has been high. The Arbitrum DAO is well-positioned to lead by taking community-driven governance initiatives and turning them into highly impactful programs that strengthen the protocol’s future.
Our stance on overall goals for the Arbitrum DAO includes the following ideas that we believe should be a priority:

Developing and implementing a robust treasury management framework that aligns the DAO’s strategic goals with the actions and decisions of those responsible for managing the treasury.
Creating a responsible Treasury Diversification plan, such as developing best practices to make the DAO sustainable and able to support public goods initiatives.
Developing a dynamic and prosperous DeFi ecosystem that nurtures the network’s expansion, ultimately translating into increased revenue for the DAO.
Further fostering programs that maintain healthy voter participation levels and representation that enhance the DAO governance.

F. Sample Voting Issue 1:**

Issue Overview 1.3k


Uniswap planned to use Flipside to attract new users to Uniswap through bounties. Although the program outline and funding was fine, the proposal was contentious because it gave Flipside crypto too much control over allocating UNI to bounties and oversight of the entire program.
For instance, Flipside had 3/7 seats on the allocation committee and 1/3 seats on the Oversight committee. There was also concern since none of the other analytics service providers were involved in the proposal.
This proposal flew under the radar but at the 11th hour got very heated. Large votes from university clubs supported the proposal since they would get a seat on the allocation committee. However, Dune and Leshner spoke up about the issue because of the centralisation of power and favor of one service provider.

How would you vote?
We would vote Against it due to concerns about the centralisation of power around the oversight of the bounties program.
What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?
There are two issues here. This creates a skewed power distribution, and critical delegates overlook this issue for their benefit. To help solve this, the following could be amended:

The allocation committee could be restructured to remove some representations by Flipside.
The proposal should mandate that those who would benefit from a seat on the allocation committee must abstain from voting.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralisation of authority and the ability to get things done?
We recognise that these mistakes can be unintentional and that some of the most valuable DAO members are active across many initiatives. With this in mind, our approach would be to ensure that a culture and formal rules remain in place that promote active DAO members to uphold many roles but disclose conflicts of interest. Members with conflicts of interest should recuse themselves from voting or decision-making.

FEI RARI Hack Reimbursement: In April 2022, Rari was hacked for 80M, and a vote was passed to reimburse those affected. Then, in May 2022, another vote to refund the Rari hacked was brought forward. This time, it was not passed.

Outside the flipping of the vote, how would you choose to handle this situation?
Split Reimbursement
Please elaborate on what instances you believe it is right to refund and which are not.
A refund is appropriate where errors have been made that are not the fault of the depositors, but only if the longevity and sustainability of the protocol are maintained.

A refund that can not be sustainably issued due to the size should be restructured, delivered over time, or reconsidered to ensure it does not undermine the protocol’s long-term health.

 Some Governance Discussions:
[Non-Constitutional]: Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0
Description:
This proposal aims to recognize and reward early community members, known as “Arbiters,” for their significant contributions to the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem from 2021 to 2023.
The proposal suggests allocating 375,000 $ARB tokens to these contributors, who did not receive any airdrops or rewards at the time of the Arbitrum DAO’s inception.
The goal is to establish a transparent and fair reward system through the Arbitrum DAO to acknowledge past contributions and encourage ongoing dedication.
Status:
No next action has been determined yet.
[RFC] Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal
Description:
This proposal aims to restructure the Arbitrum security council to meet L2BEAT’s updated security council requirements. The goal is to prevent Arbitrum from being downgraded from a “Stage 1” to a “Stage 0” designation. The proposal suggests adjusting the multisig thresholds and extending the exit window for users to align with these requirements.
Status:
The RFC period is set from January 11th to January 18th, followed by a Snapshot voting period from January 18th to January 25th.
If any option other than “make no changes” is selected, an on-chain vote is planned from January 30th to February 13th.
The entire process is expected to be completed by February 27th.
[Non-Constitutional] Thank ARB by Plurality Labs - Milestone 2: Scaling Value Creation in the DAO
Description:
This proposal aims to fund the second milestone of the Pluralistic Grants Framework for Arbitrum, with the goal of scaling value creation in the DAO.
The proposal seeks to increase funding to 30M ARB annually and is structured into three sections: SENSE, RESPOND, and EVOLVE, each targeting specific improvements in DAO operations.
The initiative emphasizes community-led processes, decentralization, and the importance of scaling rapidly to maintain a competitive edge in the Layer 2 space.
Status:
A voting process is set in the forum with subsequent adjustments before continuing the governance process. Option 2, with 92% approval and the goal of funding 30M ARB, is now the focal point.

13818,DisruptionJoe,2023-04-13 03:39:51,"Congrats to the DAO and the Foundation for (almost) getting to the next steps! Now the real work begins.
We have the opportunity to lead the industry, to have Vitalik writing about how cool what we are doing is, and to prove the dream that DAOs can be a better way of organizing network governance. This can be a lot of fun.
The Problem with DAOs
We are about to see a flood of proposals. The problem is that without the DAO creating some frameworks for giving out the funding, there are certain dynamics that play out naturally unless there is some level of mindful intervention.
The pattern we’ve seen from other DAOs looks something like this:

Crazy spending spree with no concerns about outcomes
3-12 months in (and a ton of wasted funds later) people start asking for accountability
DAO centralizes control to show stewards it is accountable
Voter apathy starts and no innovation (or fun) is happening

(I’d be happy to go into why each of these stages happens and why I’m sure this network dynamic will play out here, but for brevity’s sake will avoid details here. Please ask if you’d like a separate post on this.)
The problem with this cascading pattern of reactivity is that at each stage, the individual actors are “doing the right thing” at the moment - at the cost of the future. Now let’s explore how we could intervene in a way that changes our future.
What We Can Do About It
This potential proposal has a few goals and corresponding signals to know we’ve achieved them

Help us avoid the above pattern (Signal: People are buying $ARB to use in governance)
Establish the most innovative grant program in existence (Signal: Vitalik writes an article saying “They set out to create the most innovative and high performing grants program in existence and I believe they have done just that!” before 12/31/24.
Create a pluralistic funding framework (Signal: We establish concurrent frameworks for funding by 12/31/23)
Consider the potential for mechanisms to ensure the longevity of the DAO (Signal: Treasury is diversified to 10% stablecoins & on-chain guarantees of at least 10 years of budget availability for the DAO by the end of 2023)

Now that I have visited you with the Ghost of the Arbitrum DAO future and presented some easily executable ways to alleviate the problems, let’s dive a little deeper into each solution.
Help us avoid the above pattern
Signal: People are buying $ARB to use in governance
Doing this requires a pluralistic funding framework and some principles to establish the collective desires of the DAO. A great tool for finding the interest groups in the DAO is Polis, a software using advanced statistics to find non-polarizing agreements for passing proposals.
Perhaps a principle would be that we split the proposal stage from the voting/decision-making stage in a way that creates the best possible version of a proposal prior to voting???
Here is a Polis I created just for this exercise.
Create a pluralistic funding framework
Signal: We establish concurrent frameworks for funding by 12/31/23
Most DAOs have made the mistake of trying to find the single best way to fund work. This is difficult because some work is high context and requires low turnover and the DAO should expect efficiency from the executing team.
Other work, such as research and development, is designed to innovate. This means that setting an accountability metric might be counterproductive. For this work, an agreement to spend x% of the total budget over y months with an output of the expert council rating their work as high quality might be a better method.
Another consideration is the funding mechanism and timing. A direct grants program takes a lot of work from a few people. Its centralization is what makes it good at giving out large amounts to contributors with proven track records. Quadratic Funding is great for the community to find new projects to add to the landscape. Quadratic Voting is good at taking a fixed budget and allocating it between vetted projects. Retroactive funding is great because you already know what impact was made.
We could use other DAO tools like JokeDAO contests, HATS protocol, and Govrn. We can experiment with projects using DAOhaus MolochV3s with Proposal Inverter. We could partner with Otterspace for badging and Token Engineering Academy for designing economic games they use with small portions of the total budget.

The point is that it isn’t about using one mechanism, curator, or authority. It is about using many different ones for what they are best at.

Establish the most innovative grant program in existence
Signal: Vitalik writes an article saying “They set out to create the most innovative and high-performing grants program in existence and I believe they have done just that!” before 12/31/24.
We can do this. Gitcoin just launched its grants protocol. This provides a liquidity network of supporters and projects/grantees sharing open data in a standardized format. Metadata on-chain, data on IPFS, Graph subgraphs… the timing is perfect.
They currently only have Quadratic Funding available, but they have a product development goal to have quadratic voting AND direct grants programs available on the Allo protocol & GrantStack in the next 5 months!
Open data is a game changer. It allows us to crowdsource analysis about how well each funding round does, how we can defend from fraud, and anything else that data science can answer.
For a small amount, we could have the biggest grants program on Gitcoin. For a little more we could own a significant amount of Gitcoin governance tokens and help guide development to include us as a design partner in building the most innovative grants program in existence.
Consider ideas to ensure the longevity of the DAO
Signal: Treasury is diversified to 10% stablecoins & onchain guarantees of at least 10 years of budget availability for the DAO by the end of 2023
This would likely be a separate proposal, but it is worth considering together here before this becomes a proposal (or three). Here are three ways we could establish a DAO longevity strategy.

Put out an RFP to find a treasury manager
Set up a balancer pool to sell $ARB for stables at a slight discount over time
Create contributor agreements to clarify the legal contracting status
Put 50% of DAO funds in an issuance curve to ensure longevity if the price is stable

Have the issuance curve go directly into our grants program pool - end-to-end issuance to work being executed!



Why Do I Care
I’ve been full-time in crypto since 2017 when my Chicago Blockchain Project meetup grew to almost 4,000 members. I joined Gitcoin in 2020 where I ran the grants program operations rounds 8, 9, and 10. From there, I was the first person to voluntarily leave the company into the uncertainty of the DAO when it launched in May of 2021.
For the last 2 years, I’ve been leading the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream for Gitcoin. With the launch of our protocols, it is a good time for me to step down from leadership and wind down the FDD workstream. The open-source tools and the techniques we learned to prevent fraud are something I can provide ecosystems in the future.
What I’m saying is that I’m heavily biased that I can help us to execute this plan and I’d love to have Arbitrum as an early partner for my endeavor.
However, I’m a purist. I want to do it through and with the DAO. I want to prove that DAOs can be what we all think they could be. I usually put my blinders on and work on the one project in front of me (while shitposting). Leaving Gitcoin is a great opportunity to learn to be a good steward of another ecosystem - and I chose Arbitrum.
The Ask - Next Steps
As AIP 1.1 & 1.2 pass and you see a bunch of proposals start to pop up, some good like @0x_Buidler hackathon rewards here… (and some less good), I would like you to ask yourself,

“Is the pattern Joe brought to light going to happen here?”

This happens for sure. I think you are 100% correct that the time to take advantage of the advantages we have with crypto and smart contracts is now! It becomes much harder to change as a DAO matures.
I really like the approach of using different tools, depending on the situation or at least to keep things interesting. I certainly have my favorites of the tools you have listed but have always kept an open door to trying everything.
As sub communities start forming around different ideas or work streams, hopefully an environment is in place to support the teams and community first and let the tools used be whatever works best.
I think where a lot of DAOs struggle is the balance between long term thinking and being agile enough to accomplish tasks. I think this post (future proposal) takes a good experienced stab at getting ahead of the things that lead to many DAOs demise. There is both a focus on sustainability for the DAO and funding projects that are accomplishing goals. (insert flywheel diagram).
P.S. Quadratic Voting is one of the most elegant things that has come out of crypto ever. Absolutely “made” for a chain like Arbitrum",5

Thanks for kicking this off! I’m Traver from the Messari Governor team.
You bring up valid points, especially the traps of careless spending and ineffective distribution. While experimentation is admirable, the goal of ARB distribution for grants should be to effectively attract talented builders to Arbitrum, identify them, and reward them for delivering mission-aligned results. This is not mutually exclusive to innovative funding, but it is an important distinction that can be distracted by chasing innovative governance.



 DisruptionJoe:

Most DAOs have made the mistake of trying to find the single best way to fund work. This is difficult because some work is high context and requires low turnover, and the DAO should expect efficiency from the executing team.


While the DAO shouldn’t write off new approaches, it is worth noting that adopting a maverick approach can over-complicate an otherwise straightforward process resulting in headaches for grantees and administrators. Optimism recently reverted its experimental Governance Fund to a committee framework due to delegate burnout and mixed results. Many DAOs operate with grant structures using subDAOs or committees and achieve desirable outcomes (dYdX, Aave, Balancer, etc.).
Further, building an effective allocation strategy for the DAO will be difficult without understanding the Foundation’s strategy and initiatives. Regardless of how the Arbitrum Foundation proceeds - there will be holes to fill, some of which might benefit from the experimental solutions you outline above. To this point, the DAO should work with the Foundation to deliver better communications that inform how the DAO proceeds with its programs.



 DisruptionJoe:

Signal: Treasury is diversified to 10% stablecoins & onchain guarantees of at least 10 years of budget availability for the DAO by the end of 2023


The long-term financial stability of the DAO is a valid concern. The Arbitrum DAO is in a relatively unique position with a revenue-generating sequencer that (presumably) provides a steady stream of income to the DAO treasury and a soon-to-be-approved Foundation with a significant war chest designed to operate, support, and fund further Arbitrum protocol research. These dynamics should be accounted for as they likely affect budgeting, though diversification is always encouraged.

I would love to see impactful governance conducted by the Arbitrum DAO, but I think an emphasis should be placed on grantee usability and accountability. To this point, It’d be useful to hear from Arbitrum ecosystem builders on their experience with grant programs and what a best-in-class grantee experience might comprise.

 DisruptionJoe:

the best possible version of a proposal


This goal makes sense, the challange usually comes when folks want to propose a lot of changes in one giant proposal. I wish there were a tool like github for DAO proposal where folks who disagree on particular points in a proposal could fork that specific part , have a separate consensus mechanism around it and merge back to the main proposal once consensus has been gathered.
On pluralistic funding and innovation, I personally like the retroactive aspect of funding more than proactive. Maybe a small portion of the ask can be funded upfront while the majority can be added to a matching pool for seasonal QF rounds. This way we can focus on funding outcomes than ‘labor’, specificaly outcomes which generate signals on community-product fit.
The best meta-treasury management I have seen in DAOs usually comes from a specialised group either in the form of a service provider or a ‘home grown’ team which requires a focus on curation.
Happy to co-author proposals with you or others here on many of these topics",8

Next steps - Launching a JokeDAO contest
I’d like to launch a JokeDAO contest next Monday to procure submissions to community-source the best grants program framework possible.
The point is not that the winning submission will be chosen. There have to be another step asking potential framework operators to propose execution plans along with the budget requests for voting on Tally.
We would do this to separate the proposal creation stage from the proposal execution decision. Let’s source divergent ideas from the community, then have operators take the best ideas from the JokeDAO contest and remix them into something they feel is feasible to execute. They would also take responsibility for the results.

Framework for the JokeDAO contest
JokeDAO contests have a submission stage and a voting stage. Those familiar with design thinking principles will recognize this as a divergence and convergence process. First, we source all the potential ideas, then we converge on which of these ideas we like best.

Part 1 - Contest parameters
Here are some starting points for a debate we can have until the contest is launched on Monday, April 24th.
Who can submit - Anyone, literally anyone
Who can vote on submissions - Top 100 delegates
How will votes work? - Each voter will receive 100 jkARB
I will personally fund 1,000 $ARB to the winner of the contest. This is my skin in the game. If we create a fair and forward-thinking grants program, I’d likely be able to recover this in the future.

Why have only top delegates vote
It is difficult to do more than 230 addresses on JokeDAO as of now. This is why I would send VOTING tokens to the TOP 100 Delegates.

Why not use $ARB holdings to determine how many jkARB VOTING tokens they get. Because that would be more difficult and we don’t know if it would give better results. Also, since this is an information sourcing contest and not a vote, it doesn’t matter.

 DisruptionJoe:

Other work, such as research and development, is designed to innovate. This means that setting an accountability metric might be counterproductive. For this work, an agreement to spend x% of the total budget over y months with an output of the expert council rating their work as high quality might be a better method.

18873,TreasureDAO,2023-10-13 17:07:42,"About Treasure

Hey there, we’re Treasure! Treasure is a decentralized game publisher pioneering a new era of gaming in web3 owned and built by all.
Founded in 2021, Treasure has quickly grown to become a top gaming ecosystem that is home to over 15+ indie games built by seasoned game teams, including The Beacon, Mighty Action Heroes, Zeeverse, Kaiju Cards, Knights of the Ether, and many more. We also have our own in-house game studio working on developing its first flagship title based on the original Treasure IP. All projects on Treasure are linked–narratively and economically–through our network. Our community supports the entire game ecosystem to grow new projects and continue supporting more mature ones.
Treasure is one of the earliest projects to come to Arbitrum, and we’ve grown up together with it. We’re delighted and honored to be one of the largest delegates of Arbitrum DAO and look forward to representing the interests of our ecosystem and community, while advocating for the interests of gaming and entertainment, as well as other areas in order to help make Arbitrum one of the best places to be for builders and users (players!) alike.
Delegate Communication Thread

As a prominent participant in the Arbitrum ecosystem, Treasure acknowledges the significant responsibility due to the Treasure Community in advocating for the interests of the community as well as web3 gaming broadly within Arbitrum, and concurrently, fostering the expansion and prosperity of the overarching Arbitrum DAO.
Treasure’s Arbitrum Representative Council (ARC)

To fulfil this commitment, the Treasure core council has established the ARC, an independent community-led council, consisting of members from both the Treasure and Arbitrum communities. This initiative aims to facilitate more proactive monitoring, engagement, and active participation in Arbitrum’s governance initiatives. The ARC will allow Treasure core contributors to remain primarily focused on ecosystem growth at Treasure while also seeking to satisfy its obligation to the Treasure community to advocate for Treasure-specific and broader web3 gaming interests and effective governance processes at the Arbitrum, ultimately resulting in benefits to both the Treasure and Arbitrum communities.
The selection of initial eight members for the ARC was confirmed on 30th October and a kick off call was launched on November 6th.

Vision:
What we want to achieve…
To make Arbitrum the home of web3 gaming and Treasure DAO a leading voice within the Arbitrum gaming ecosystem.
Mission:
How we get there…
Empower web3 gaming on Arbitrum by swiftly identifying and onboarding talented developers, ensuring high impact execution of gaming initiatives and supporting effective governance of Arbitrum DAO.
Values:
We vote with our values and use them as a yardstick to dictate how we engage with the Treasure DAO and Arbitrum Communities. The ARC is aligned around the core values of:

Integrity
Innovation
Experimentation
Equal opportunity
Community driven

North Stars
We are seeking to improve the following metrics as North Stars for the ARC:

# gaming users in the Arbitrum ecosystem
# gaming users in the Treasure ecosystem
% share of txns relating to gaming within Arbitrum
Transaction volume on the Arbitrum Network

Communication
We are committed to providing a high level of visibility and engagement over ARC activity to the Arbitrum and Treasure communities respectively. Key communication channels and cadence is broken down below:

Monthly ARC Community Call

We will host monthly ARC calls in the Treasure DAO Discord


Call attendance

A minimum of one member of the ARC will join the “Arbitrum Open Governance Call”, and “Open Arbitrum Delegates workshop / Arbitrum Top Problems workshop ” on a weekly basis.
We also commit to attending other relevant Arbitrum related calls as/when required


Delegate Thread

We will maintain the Treasure DAO Communication Thread and use it to confirm

Voting decision and rationale. To ensure continuity of conversation this will also be shared in the proposal specific thread.
Updates to ARC Structure or priorities





ARC Liaison
The ARC appreciates that the Arbitrum community desires proactive input and feedback on various proposals and emerging initiatives. To meet these expectations and ensure that the 8-person structure of the ARC does not hinder us from providing timely responses, we are introducing the ARC Liaison initiative.
This would see every Arbitrum Proposal be assigned 1-3 ARC Liaisons. These are the “go-to” people within ARC for any given proposal or initiative. The ARC Liaisons for any given proposal are responsible for:

Working with the Arbitrum Proposal team to review and deeply understand the contents of any given proposal
Providing updates on the proposal, share perspectives and answers question from the broader ARC
Collating broader feedback from the ARC and sharing it with the proposal team
Responsible for confirming and executing decision/vote on behalf of the ARC (once ARC multisig is set up)

This approach aims to facilitate more streamlined communication and engagement without requiring each member to provide exhaustive feedback on every proposal.
Engagement by the ARC Liaison for any given Arbitrum Proposal will be structured as follows depending on the stage of the proposal.

Pre-forum

ARC Liaisons are encouraged to provide their own personal perspectives on the proposal on the forum and in delegate channels.


Forum

ARC Liaisons will talk through proposal with the broader ARC team, and provide feedback and recommended changes on the proposal within the relevant forum thread


Snapshot

ARC Liaisons will confirm the final Snapshot decision with Broader ARC before making a final vote. ARC Liaisons will publish their rationale for the vote on the Treasure Delegate Thread and in the proposal specific post under the ARC forum account.


Tally

ARC Liaisons will confirm the final Snapshot decision with Broader ARC before making a final vote. ARC Liaisons will publish their rationale for the vote on the Treasure Delegate Thread and in the proposal specific post under the ARC forum account.



How to be assigned an ARC Liaison?
All governance proposals taken to Snapshot will be automatically assigned an ARC Liaison. Major governance proposals may be proactively assigned an ARC Liaison prior to being taken through Snapshot. We also provide opportunities for individuals wishing to take a proposal through Snapshot to request an ARC Liaison when the initiative and proposal is in its development stage. This can be done via the following steps:

Join the Treasure DAO Discord
Navigate to “Help and Support” and create a ticket under “ARC Enquiries Ticket”
If you can’t see this channel, please go to “Channels & Roles”, “Browse Channels” and click the checkmark to follow the channel
The ARC will then review your ticket and assign a Liaison
The Liaison will reach out to you via the telegram contact details you provided in your Enquiries Ticket

18873,TreasureDAO,2023-10-13 17:39:17,"Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP) Round 1 Note

In relation to Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal).
We were pleased as DAO contributors to see the amount of activity on this proposal and the increased awareness that came to the ecosystem as a result. To evaluate these requests as fairly as possible and due service to the amount of time it took to submit a proposal, we constructed a framework for on-chain metrics to guide our evaluations.
For the complete list of votes, see our profile on Snapshot.
Key Considerations

Arbitrum native or, if non-native, included Arbitrum as a major part of its strategy in addition to mainnet
Total volume, both historical and recent: we considered both factors and evaluated each project as pragmatically as we could given the impact that the bear market has had on projects further in their token life-cycle while younger projects benefit from increased token speculation even during such conditions. We tried to account for the total value that projects have brought to the ecosystem and their likelihood to thrive and provide continued value in the years ahead.
Accounted for differences in trade volume for perp protocols which generally have higher trade volumes due to leverage (notional values).
TVL: we looked at the TVL of protocols as a metric but tried to also evaluate the purpose that this TVL serves in each instance.

Where possible, we look to Dune dashboards to get a more normalised picture of project usage over time (self reported metrics over arbitrary or selective time periods can paint a different picture).


Evaluated gaming and social projects by a different framework: Gaming has lower financial metrics. We evaluated DAUs, retention metrics, and activity over time instead. For example, some gaming projects that submitted a proposal have DAUs multiples higher than DeFi protocols that dwarf these games in TVL. However, in regards to on-chain activity and value to Arbitrum, we regarded them as equal.
We also evaluated projects based on how likely they were to help bring value to all Arbitrum projects, for instance bridge, quest, and community loyalty projects that lowered friction for user acquisition and proposals could help with user retention for all Arbitrum projects as a whole.

“Against” vs. “Abstain” vs. Not Voting.
We deliberated the implications of voting “against” versus “abstain” versus not participating at all with the understanding that the votes functioned differently at different stages of the voting period. This latter point was somewhat confusing which has led to some misunderstandings.
The vote effectively went through 3 stages:

Stage 1: Did the proposal pass the 71.5mil quorum?
Stage 2: Did the proposal pass 50% approval? (for / (for + against))
Stage 3: If over 50 mil is allocated, prioritise proposals with highest count of “for” votes (tiebreak with FCFS)

Stage 1
In the first stage of the vote, Treasure only voted “for” on proposals which we had high conviction in. Initially we had focused only on the projects we strongly felt would improve the Arbitrum ecosystem and meaningfully attract and retain new users according to the criteria outlined above.
Stage 2 + 3
As the dollar value of proposals that reached quorum began to exceed the $50mil cap, it became clear that we could better express our opinion and support our existing “for” votes by enacting “against” votes.
This isn’t to say that those projects aren’t doing interesting or valuable experimental work. Rather, these were projects that (in our opinion) appeared too early in development, a poor fit for user acquisition incentives at this stage of the market, or niche and complex products that would likely only enrich existing users of the project.
Other “against” votes were presented for projects and proposals which we felt were either overbearingly large relative to their stage and potential, or potentially risky to the Arbitrum ecosystem from both a user and builder’s perspective (second order implications where we may inadvertently discourage new projects choosing Arbitrum as a homebase).
On Abstaining vs. Not Participating
Since “abstain” votes matter only in the first stage in helping a proposal reach quorum, they were effectively votes that merely expressed our opinion without necessarily influencing outcomes.
Abstain votes were a way for us to express that we felt a proposal wasn’t quite ready for incentives or a right fit for increasing user acquisition and retention on Arbitrum (for a multitude reasons listed above), but also that we didn’t feel so strongly as to vote down a project and influence the outcome of the vote.
Treasure runs a games publishing ecosystem that depends on collaborating with other projects. We receive daily requests to look at various Arbitrum proposals, some of which we may not necessarily agree with, nor think helps the Arbitrum ecosystem and gaming in general. Ignoring requests to look at proposals can lead to tension and it isn’t the responsible answer either. Our primary responsibility is to prioritise TreasureDAO and remain diplomatic and express opinions tactfully in a way that doesn’t undermine future collaborations with projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem. An “abstain” vote helped us express this viewpoint more thoroughly.",2
18873,TreasureDAO,2023-10-13 23:26:08,"Security Council Elections: Round 2 Update

Tally - Security Council Elections: Round 2
Important note: As flagged by a handful of other delegates, when attempting to vote, we encountered an issue that resulted in the entirety of our votes going to the first nominee. This was the result of a misunderstanding paired with the user experience of the Tally platform auto-filling and selecting the max vote allocation by default versus starting at zero to split our voting power towards multiple nominees. Unfortunately, this was an unintentional and irreversible action. With that said, our recommendations and desired allocations are listed below.
Recommendation

Ordered by planned vote allocation:

Patrick McCorry (Arbitrum Foundation) - 20% | 5,514,766.18
Harry Kalodner (Offchain Labs) - 20% | 5.51M
0xJiro (Sushi) - 15.0% | 4.14M
Omer (Chaos Labs) - 5.0% | 1.38M
Matt Fiebach (Blockworks) - 17.5% | 4.83M
Emiliano Bonassi (Conduit) - 22.5% | 6.20M

Actual vote allocation:

Patrick McCorry (Arbitrum Foundation) - 100% | 27.57M

Perspective and Assessment Framework

As a whole, we felt it was important to ensure the Security Council comprised with a mix of both deeply technical members as well as non-technical members. Members should also be geographically spread to ensure wide coverage across the globe in the event of any possible emergency that may require quick and decisive action. On the criteria for technical members, nominees were assessed on the basis of deep technical prowess and understanding, security experience, proficiency with the programming languages listed in the self assessment matrix, and overall contribution to the Arbitrum DAO and broader ecosystem. For non-technical members, we prioritized their contribution to Arbitrum DAO, communication ability, alignment with Arbitrum values, and overall reputation.",3
18873,TreasureDAO,2023-11-14 01:00:45,"Backfund Successful STIP Grants

Treasure DAO’s Arbitrum Representative Council (ARC) voted FOR this proposal on Snapshot.
As the DAO approved the initial round of STIPs, we believe that it is important to fund the smaller / newer projects that were at a disadvantage in the original selection process. This proposal will help boost the integrity of the original STIP. Moreover, the Arbitrum ecosystem would benefit from supporting these projects who have significant room to grow. Funding these teams will also help counteract governance and capital monopolies on Arbitrum by spreading $ARB among a more diverse group of users.
At the same time, we recognize some of the pitfalls of the initial iteration of the STIP and the uncertainty for any protocol or project who wished to apply for Round 2. As a council, we would like to see and further engage in the development of a Round 2 (3, 4, and so on) framework and move to forming a Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) as the DAO continues to progress, learn, and evolve to serve the interests of all builders and community members (current and future).",4

We wholeheartedly endorse the ongoing technological advancements of Arbitrum, aiming to foster an improved ecosystem for both users and builders alike.

Procurement Framework | Security : Non-Constitutional Proposal

Treasure DAO’s Arbitrum Representative Council (ARC) will vote FOR this proposal on Snapshot.

Need for Robust Security: There is a clear need for robust security to safeguard the integrity and security of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.
Need for High Quality Providers: Selecting qualified, reliable, and high-quality security service providers is an important topic for Abritrum DAO to get right.
Efficiency, Transparency, and Fairness: We commend the proposal for taking significant strides toward establishing an efficient, transparent, and fair process for vendor selection. This framework is clearly well thought through and driving toward the delivery of high-impact outcomes for the DAO.
Clear Structure: We agree with the overall procurement structure proposed: sequentially covering: Needs Assessment [1], Publication of RFP [2], Submission Period [3], Evaluation Phase [4] and Whitelisting Onboarding & Contract [5]. We believe this framework has to deliver high-impact selection decisions for the DAO.
Proactive Identification of Needs: The inclusion of a Needs Assessment is particularly commendable, allowing the Arbitrum DAO to proactively identify crucial needs and select suitable service providers. We hope this proactive approach for vendor selection extends more broadly across the DAO.
Standardized RFP Process: We support the standardization of the RFP process submission guidelines, enhancing the ability for like-for-like comparisons of service providers and, consequently, improved selection outcomes for the DAO.
Ongoing Performance Monitoring: The provision for ongoing performance monitoring, review, and renewal ensures the DAO continues to receive suitable and secure service support throughout their engagement.
Further Clarity on Evaluation and Selection Process: There are still important details to flesh out, more notably the further details on the evaluation process, procurement committee, and final vendor selection mechanism. However, we are optimistic that further details will mirror the ethos of fairness, transparency, and inclusivity already expressed within this proposal.

In Summary
In summary we feel this proposal represents a well thought through and considered framework to helping the DAO address an important topic. We look forward to supporting the continued conversation.
Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal

Treasure DAO’s Arbitrum Representative Council (ARC) will vote AGAINST this proposal on Tally.
We would like to express our appreciation for the proposal to retroactively fund contributors for their early efforts in Arbitrum. Recognizing and rewarding the dedication of these individuals is a commendable initiative. However, after careful consideration and in alignment with concerns raised by other delegates, we find ourselves unable to support the proposal in its current form for the following reasons:

Lack of Information on Arbiters and Their Contributions: We understand and appreciate the inherent challenges in quantifying contributions, but the current proposal lacks essential details about the group of Arbiters and their specific contributions. We advocate for a more comprehensive and transparent breakdown of individual efforts and achievements, evidenced by concrete examples and links to work products. This additional information is crucial for enhancing transparency and enabling delegates to make informed decisions.
Absence of Justification and Detailed Breakdown for Requested Amount: It is unclear how the proposed amount was determined or how the allocation to individual Arbiters is directly correlated with individual or group contributions to ensure a fair and equitable distribution. To ensure fairness and transparency in the retroactive reward process and to set a sound precedent for future contributors seeking retroactive payment, we urge a more detailed and justified breakdown of the requested amount.
Incentivise Ongoing Support: As supported by other delegates, we advocate for the establishment of a clear and open framework to incentivize future contributions. In cases where responsibilities predominantly involve Discord moderation or other forward-looking activities, we propose exploring a continuous and sustainable compensation program that encourages ongoing contributions rather than a one-time retroactive payment.

In summary, while we share the principle of rewarding contributors, we believe the proposal requires amendments to address critical concerns raised by various delegates and the community. We encourage a thorough review and revision of the proposal to provide the necessary transparency into the retroactive payment as well as outlining a framework for compensation for future contributions.
As the voting deadline approaches, we have chosen to vote against the current proposal. We remain open for discussions and available to provide additional feedback as required.",5

18873,TreasureDAO,2024-01-11 21:30:21,"Long-Term Incentive Pilot Program

Treasure DAO’s Arbitrum Council (ARC) will vote FOR this proposal on Snapshot to fund the program with 45,815,000 (ranked in descending order of ARB amount).
Treasure has been involved in the pre-forum socialization process for the Long-Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP) and believes it addresses many of the challenges identified through STIP Round 1, further builds upon it, and will set the foundation to establish a long-term, sustainable incentives/grants program that will support the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Tests a program structure that could be greatly scaled up across sectors with a lens towards plurality: In the long run, we believe that sector/cluster-based programs with DAO-elected councils comprising subject matter experts and Arbitrum-aligned builders will win out as the optimal set up to award incentives. LTIPP will serve as the first stab at this, applied against all categories within Arbitrum DAO which will be an informative exercise while unlocking necessary funds for ecosystem protocols and builders.
Broadens scope of incentives to enable greater flexibility: Coming from the gaming angle, we’re delighted to see the acknowledgement of this problem (#3) as it was a pain point that was universally shared across games both in and outside of the Treasure DAO ecosystem. Notably, the strict limitation on incentive mechanisms forced DeFi distributions of grants which needed to be expressly complied with which we do not believe to be aligned to the needs of games.
Reduces the burden on delegates while maintaining veto power: As an active delegate who reviewed and voted on all STIP Round 1 applicants, the burden placed on protocol delegates was great as we felt the weight of responsibility and expectation to strive to participate in the STIP engagement, review, and voting process, while also delivering against the needs of Treasure DAO’s own priorities.

With our support of this proposal, we also urge the DAO to consider the following:

Electing a diverse council: We believe the council approach paired with the application advisors are both a step in the right direction. Beyond this, what will be of paramount importance are two things: (1) ensuring both groups comprise balanced, knowledgeable and thoughtful members who can represent Arbitrum’s diverse ecosystem of projects across sectors; and (2) ensuring the council designs a universal rubric that can be applied across all types of projects – whether they be DeFi, RWAs, gaming, infrastructure, and so on.
Getting this program in front of as many Arbitrum builders as possible: For those of us who have been deeply engaged in Arbitrum governance, this has been a major topic of discussion for some time. For those outside of it though, it’s easy to not be aware of this potential funding and support path for all who would be able to benefit from this. The Arbitrum DAO community and Arbitrum Foundation needs to amplify and promote this program as much as possible to get this in front of the protocols and builders helping grow the Arbitrum network.

Please share your stance on overall goals for the DAO:
how aggressive should we be in liquidity mining, what is the goal of the DAO?
I am not the biggest fan of liquidity mining, at least not directly from a DAO; I think that in the best of many cases the best is to apply to different protocols that kind of incentives, maybe like Optimism that brought diverse uses to its network incentivizing it in an indirect way in usability and ecosystem.
Sample Voting Issue 1:

How would you vote?

Against

What amendments would you make to the proposal if any?

Diversity of opinions and participants should be the main objective of a DAO, if a small group centralizes power, the name DAO is only an aggregate.
Something that can help is to predefine in the beginning the creation of committees and delimit the members it should have at the expense of increasing diversity against personal interests.

How would you approach the tradeoff between centralization of authority and the ability to get things done?

It is a bad reference to the DAOs, the more decentralized the more difficult it is to agree, but I feel that the committees or delegates fulfill that vital function of representing the voice of many in order to optimize the governance processes.
Sample Voting Issue 2:

Split Reimbursement

A DAO must ensure the best environment for its members and also take into account their survival, therefore it will depend a lot on the cases and the type of hack, by literally draining their funds I do not think they can pay.
That’s why I think the best thing to do, and depending on the case like FEI, is to return money to those affected, maybe under a vesting system or the DAO can get down to work to look after the interests of its users.

 Presentation:
About myself, @ocandocrypto, I am currently building web3citizen.xyz as a core contributor. Web3 citizen is a community-driven open-source project aimed at simplifying the Web3 Ecosystem. We started by building The State of DAOs 2023 report and weekly governance highlights.
Additionally, I built one of the largest blockchain schools in Latin America at Platzi (developer bootcamps section).
Now, I am excited to begin my decentralized journey as part of the Arbitrum DAO and aim to contribute more through here the SavvyDeFi Arbitrum DAO Committee.
 Governance Discussions:
Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’
Description:
The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC) is a proposal to establish a collective within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Its purpose is to support the development and implementation of ideas from Arbitrum DAO members. The ARDC aims to enhance governance proposals, conduct code reviews, provide economic risk analysis, and increase delegate engagement. It strives to improve governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement through services such as objective assessments, proposal improvement tooling, security reviews, and risk mitigation.
This proposal improves upon The Arbitrum Coalition proposal and discusses the Collective’s focus areas, proposed members, and funding.
The collective would consist of experts in various fields and include roles such as the DAOAdvocate, Risk Member, Security Member, and Research Member, operating within a legally enforceable framework with checks and balances.
Status:

The ARDC proposal has passed the snapshot vote.
The next steps involve posting the on-chain proposal with the correct implementations and amendments based on community feedback.

Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee
Description:
The ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) proposal aims to establish a committee responsible for managing procurement in the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Its initial responsibilities include creating a ‘Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers’ and potentially expanding its duties in the future.
The committee will be composed of three members elected for 6-month terms through an application process, KYC/KYB review, and Snapshot’s weighted voting. The ADPC will operate under an agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation, adhering to ethical guidelines and governance standards.
Status:

A snapshot voting is currently active until January 9, 2024, and the current results show an approval rate of over 97% snapshot

 Proposal Differences: ARDC and ADPC

These two proposals, the ARDC and ADPC, present unique approaches to governance within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The ARDC focuses on empowering DAO members by supporting idea development and implementation, while the ADPC prioritizes efficient procurement management. Both proposals exemplify the commitment of the Arbitrum community to enhancing transparency, security, and community engagement in shaping the ecosystem’s future.

Long Term Incentives Pilot Program
Description:
The Long Term Incentives Program is an initiative aimed at distributing ARB incentives to protocols on Arbitrum. It seeks to address the issues identified in the previous STIP V1 and aims to improve distribution through innovative mechanisms, feedback processes, and a more efficient evaluation structure involving a council and advisors. Council members and advisors will be selected from nominations and voted on separately.
Similar to STIP in Round 1, selected protocols will receive their requested ARB using bi-weekly Hedgey streams until Abril 26th. Protocols will be required to finish their incentives distribution on return any unused funds to the DAO by May 10th.
Status:

The application thread has concluded. Application Advisors and Council members will be elected via Snapshot, allowing the DAO to choose these positions.
The DAO will have the opportunity to vote on the size of the Pilot Program, with options for 25M, 35M, and 45M ARB in incentives budgets.
An open proposal discussion meeting occurred on January 5th.

Our first guide, The State of the DAOs 2023, launched. It focuses on DAO governance, providing a comprehensive guide to understand its framework, mechanisms and ways to contribute. As part of the guide, we’ve included our analysis on Arbitrum DAO.
As we’re committed to the continuous improvement and development of the report, we’d love to hear the community’s feedback.
We’re especially interested to hear if we missed any ways to contribute to Arbitrum.

20271,thedevanshmehta,2023-12-26 12:32:57,"This post is inspired by discussions with @Soby in the liquidity incentives WG telegram channel
Recently we have seen proposals from service providers getting rejected (arbitrum coalition, camelot) , while those same services in the form of frameworks are passed (ARDC, STIP)
It raises an interesting question for how we govern ourselves - should we encourage any provider to first create a credibly neutral framework and only then ask for money?
Or should we consider proposals not coming under a framework but are nonetheless advantageous to the DAO?
This post considers both sides of a framework based approach and then suggests some new paths forward
I. Pro’s of a frameworks based approach


acts as a needs assessment survey (does the DAO even need the service) without being colored by the vibes of the service provider


prevents a “race to the finish” where every service provider is incentivized to get their proposal up as quickly as possible, before their competitors do and the gravy train runs out.
An example from the early days is Questbook getting their proposal passed before Plurality Labs, causing some delegates to vote against PL as there was already an approved grants program in place


More efficient for delegates as they vote on frameworks and consider all applications under that framework together, rather than being constantly bombarded with individual proposals from service providers.


Arbitrum is the size of small governments, which float tender/bids even if they know exactly who they want to award a contract to. Usually RFPs result in more providers participating (only 20-30 took part in STIP consultations but 90 applied once the rules of the road were laid down) and better budget control from applicants


II. Now lets look at the cons


immense amount of friction to get anything passed; difficult to retain staff or talent when everything has to go through a framework


inability to consider proposals from world class providers at below market rates


move at a glacial place (2-3 months to get a framework passed and then providers selected under it)


III. Here are possible exceptions we can consider for passing a proposal even when there is no framework


We give more authority and funds to centralized grant providers like Questbook or Plurality Labs to nimbly make decisions on hiring service providers and talent for the DAO


We consider and vote yes on individual proposals when there is a dire need so work can get started, while concurrently spinning up a framework


we explicitly create categories, for example any proposal asking for an amount above 500k ARB goes through a framework while those requesting a lower amount can be submitted piecemeal


We allow prior contributors to submit proposals for renewal of their contract/grant without need for a framework
For example, can Plurality Labs or Questbook apply directly to the DAO for renewal of their grant as they are currently a service provider to the DAO? or do we also want them to apply under a framework? Can the Firestarters funded by Plurality Labs or projects chosen by Questbook apply directly for funding to the DAO ?


It has become something of a running joke on how everything in Arbitrum requires a framework. We’d be keen to participate in more nuanced discussions of what type of proposals require a framework and what can be passed without one.",1

Firstly, allow us to introduce ourselves for anyone who isn’t already familiar with L2Beat or our actions in Arbitrum’s governance.
L2BEAT is an independent, public goods company who acts as an impartial watchdog for the Ethereum Layer2 ecosystem. Our mission is to provide comprehensive and unbiased analysis and comparative evaluations of Layer 2 solutions . We are committed to the verification and fact-checking of the claims made by each project, with a special focus on the security aspects. What sets L2BEAT apart is our unwavering commitment to delivering accurate and reliable information.
In addition, L2Beat has a governance team (@krst and @Sinkas) which actively participates in constructive discussions of specific protocol challenges and issues, fostering the discourse toward increasingly permissionless, open source, and trustless systems. Our participation in various DAOs and public debates reflects this commitment.
For more information on L2Beat and our participation in Arbitrum’s Governance, please refer to our delegate statement on Tally.
Delegate Communication Thread
To promote transparency and communication as delegates, we’ll be regularly updating the below thread with our actions in the governance of Arbitrum. Our updates will include how we voted for different proposals and our rationale, discussions we are engaged with, and our notes from important calls/events we attended.
Update #1
Voting
[Snapshot] Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Voted FOR
After careful consideration of the pros and cons of the proposal, we decided to vote for the proposal. You can read our full rationale behind our decision, as well as a summary of the pros and cons here.
[Tally] Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook - Voted FOR
Despite initially voting against the proposal (for reasons outlined here) in the Temperature Check, after long and diligent conversation with Saurabh from the Questbook team (which you can partly follow along here), we decided to vote in favor of the proposal.
[Tally] Fund the Grants Framework Proposal Milestone 1 - Voted FOR
We voted in favor of the proposal after attending workshops held by Pluralistic Labs and having conversations with them regarding their approach. We are convinced they are aligned with the DAO, as it’s evident from their overall presence (e.g with holding workshops, their active presence in the forums and participation in discussions).
[Tally] Update Security Council Election Start Date to Ensure Time for Security Audit - Voted FOR
After raising some points regarding the proposal which were addressed by the Foundation, we voted for the proposal.
Discussion
Open Governance Call #4
On Wednesday, 26/07/2023, we hosted the 4th Open Governance call, notes/summary of which you can find in the comments. The next Governance Call will be held on Wednesday, 23/08/2023.
RFC - Grant Proposal for Blockchain Product Development Incubation
We reviewed and provided feedback to an RFC regarding  a blockchain product development incubation on Arbitrum.
L2Beat’s Arbitrum Office Hours
To further our communication with our constituents and any interested party in the community, we’re hosting recurring Office Hours on Google Meets.
The office hours will be held every Thursday at 3pm UTC/ 11am EST
During the Office Hours, you will be able to reach L2Beat’s governance team, which consists of @krst and @Sinkas and discuss our activity as delegates.
The purpose of the office hours is to gather feedback from the people who have delegated to us, answer any questions in regards to our voting activities and rationale, and collect input on things you’d like us engage in discussions about.
You can add the L2Beat Governance Calendar in your Google Calendar to find the respective Google Meets links for every call and to easily keep track of the Office Hours, as well as other important calls and events (e.g. voting deadlines) relevant to Arbitrum that L2Beat governance team will be attending or hosting.",1

15979,krst,2023-11-03 09:52:47,"Voting
[Snapshot] Onboarding Matrixed.Link as a Validator - Voted AGAINST
You can find our extensive rationale for voting against the proposal here.
[Snapshot] Building the Future of NFTs: The Rarible Protocol - Voted FOR
After extensive discussion with the Rarible team, and after them revising their proposal based on the feedback they received, we decided to vote in favour of the proposal. A more thorough explanation of our rationale can be found here.
[Tally] Building the Future of NFTs: The Rarible Protocol- Voted FOR
Following a successful temp-check, the proposal from Rarible went to on-chain vote unaltered, and therefore we voted for it to pass, just as we did during temp check.
[Tally] Update Security Council Election Start Date to Ensure Time for Security Audit - Voted FOR
After the points that we raised were addressed in discussion in the public forums, we voted in favour of the proposal.
[Tally] Security Council Implementation Spec - Voted FOR
We were in agreement with the implementation spec provided in the Security Council Elections post and therefore we voted in favour of it during the on-chain vote.
[Tally] Arbitrum One Governance Parameter Fixes - Voted FOR
Having reviewed the proposed fixes as well as the associated security audit, we decided to vote for the proposal.
[Snapshot] Time Management in Arbitrum’s Governance - Voted FOR
We engaged in a conversation with @Cattin regarding their RFC and we decided to vote in favour of the proposal after suggesting some ways the proposal could be improved before going to an on-chain vote.
[Snapshot] Domain Allocators
After reviewing all applications for each domain, and after hosting 2 pitching sessions for domain allocators (more info below), we cast our vote for each domain. Our rationale for each domain can be found here.

Dev Tooling
Gaming
New Protocol Ideas
Education, Community Growth and Events

[Snapshot] Arbitrum Short Term Incentive Program - Voted FOR
Having attended the liquidity incentives workshops, and after consulting with other delegates and relevant third parties regarding the potential impact of the program, we decided to vote for it, with a preferred allocation of 50M ARB.
[Tally] Arbitrum Short Term Incentive Program - Voted FOR
Following a successful temp-check which ended with our preferred allocation of 50M ARB as the most voted option, we cast our on-chain vote in favor of the program.
[Snapshot] Arbitrum as official sponsor of Ethereum Mexico 2023 - Voted AGAINST
Our vote against the proposal had more to do with the channel it was pursued through, rather than with the proposal itself. This proposal came after Questbook’s Grant program was voted on and after domain allocators were elected, and we believed that going through the program would be a more suitable avenue for the proposal. As a result, we voted against the proposal during temp check.
[Tally] Security Council Elections - Round 1 & Round 2
We cast our votes for both rounds after extensive internal discussion, research and due diligence. Our extensive rationale as well as the list of nominees we voted for in each round can be found here.
[Snapshot] STIP Applications
We reviewed and voted on all STIP applications. We shared our approach as well as reflections on the whole process here.
[Snapshot] Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal - Voted AGAINST
While we’re very much in favour of rewarding contributors, we felt that the amount requested was too high, without relevant data supporting it. We shared our explanation under the original proposal.
[Snapshot] Build Optimal Onboarding for STIP Teams (BOOST) - Voted AGAINST
We like the idea of using quests to educate users and help protocols distribute their STIP funds in a streamlined way. Given there was another similar proposal from Rabbithole, we felt it’d be beneficial if discussed these proposals as a DAO in more depth before deciding on an approach. That’s why we decided to vote against for the time being, but shared our support in the forum.

Domain Allocators Pitching Sessions
During the elections process for Domain Allocators for Questbook’s grant program, we organised and hosted 2 pitching sessions for Domain Allocators to introduce themselves and present their relevant experience to delegates.
Both calls were recorded and published in the forums to be available for people who were unable to make it.
Decrease Censorship Delay from 24 hours to 4 hours
Following the discussion both on the forums but also during the open governance call, we planned a separate call to discuss the proposal to reduce the censorship delay from 24 hours to 4 hours in more detail.
The recording of the call as well as the transcript can be found here.
[RFC] Introduction of a new role in governance - Governance Facilitator
We reviewed and provided our feedback to the proposal.
[RFC] Allow the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig to trade ARB for sequencer fee ETH
We reviewed and provided our feedback to the proposal.
[RFC] Delegate Incentive System for ArbitrumDAO
We had extensive conversations with @Cattin who brought forward the proposal on behalf of SEED Latam during our Office Hours, on Telegram, and during a community call hosted by SEED Latam. Overall, we believe it’s a very important topic for the DAO and as such we offered our extensive feedback to the proposal.
[RFC] Fund Arbitrum Odyssey 2.0 Airdrop
We reviewed the proposal and provided our feedback. Arbitrum Foundation announced Odyssey Reignited a week later and as a result the proposal wasn’t pursued any further.
Community Growth through Educational Content and Events & Protocol Owned Liquidity Calls
During Governance Call #6, there were 3 proposals that were briefly discussed. We followed up with organising and hosting 2 calls to facilitate a discussion around those proposals. These calls were not recorded.
[RFC] Activate ARB Staking
We shared our thoughts and feedback on a proposal by PlutusDAO to activate ARB staking.
Etherean League Gathering - Governance Workshop
L2BEAT is happy to announce that we’ll be hosting a Governance Workshop during L2DAYS in the context of Devconnect in Istanbul.

[Snapshot] Arbitrum Security Enhancement Fund - Voted FOR
Even though Cyfrin withdrew their proposal in order to participate in the procurement framework, we decided to vote in favour of their proposal to signal our support.
[Snapshot] Activate ARB Staking - Voted FOR & Lowest Amount
After our initial comments were addressed, we decided to vote in favour of the proposal. We still believed the proposal could be improved before going to on-chain vote, and therefore we voiced our opinion after we voted.
[Snapshot] The Arbitrum Coalition - Voted ABSTAIN
We were originally included in the proposal as the pre-appointed “Advocate”, even though we did not participate in the formation of the coalition and did not co-author the proposal. However, we provided our extensive feedback and point of view for the consideration of other delegates in the forums.
[Snapshot] Procurement Framework | Security - Voted FOR
DK put forward a proposal to consolidate all security-related proposals in a procurement framework. Given the multiple proposals with that scope appearing on the forum at the same time, we believe that creating a framework to onboard them makes a ton of sense and therefore voted in its favour.
[Snapshot] Backfund Successful STIP Proposals - Voted FOR
Although we were initially hesitant to support the proposal, after extensive discussion with the team leading the initiative, and after our original concerns were addressed, we were happy to support the proposal.
[Tally] Backfund Successful STIP Proposals - Voted FOR
We voted in favour of the proposal following a successful temp-check.
[Snapshot] Funding Gas Rebate and Trading Competition Program to Amplify Arbitrum’s Ecosystem Growth - Voted AGAINST
We voted against the proposal since we believe it should have pursued funding through the STIP instead of coming directly to the DAO. We encouraged the proposer to resubmit their proposal during the second round of STIP, when it becomes available.
[Tally] Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal - Voted AGAINST
Voting against the proposal was very difficult and it wasn’t a decision we made lightly. During temp-check, we communicated that we felt the requested amount was too high and that we’d be really supportive of the proposal if the request was lowered by a considerable amount. The proposal was submitted to on-chain vote without any amendment and therefore we stuck to our original decision. Our full rationale can be found here.
[Snapshot] ArbOS Version 11 - Voted FOR
We agreed with the proposed upgrades & fixes and their scope and voted in favour of the proposal during temp-check, while also committing to extensively review the proposed changes before the on-chain vote.
[Snapshot] Timeline Extension for STIP and Backfund Grantees - Voted Extend for Both
After reviewing the proposal and considering the implications of all options, we decided to vote in favour of extending the timeline both for original STIP recipients as well as for backfund grantees.
[Snapshot] Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates - Voted FOR
We’ve been involved in the discussion surrounding the concept of delegate incentives for the past few months, and we’ve actively provided our feedback through multiple RFCs before this proposal. Although we believe there are small improvements that can be made before the proposal goes to on-chain vote, we voted in favour of it during temp-check to signal our support. You can find our full rationale here.
[Snapshot] Establish the ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Voted For highest→lowest amount
We supported the proposal as we believe a collective similar to the one outlined will be very useful to the DAO.
Discussion
Ecosystem Security Fund by Sherlock
Sherlock put forward a proposal for the provision of security related services to the DAO and although they too withdrew their proposal to participate in the proposal to consolidate all security-related proposals into an RFP process, we dropped a comment in the forums to signal our support for their team.

20154,skyfoxx,2023-12-18 12:06:41,"I have been researching how DAOs make decisions and I am curious about anonymity. Since this feature is possible on discourse and is easy to enable:

Have we considered enabling it here
If yes, why, if not, why not?

My thesis is that optional anonymity would allow users to communicate candidly without needing to create a throwaway account, and would love your feedback on this.",1

20150,Web3Wanderer,2023-12-18 09:24:38,"Hey RWA Fam,
I’ve been immersing myself in the dynamic world of Real World Assets (RWA)  and am excited to discuss the innovative opportunities it presents, especially in the realm of fractional ownership and tokenization.
The concept of fractional ownership in RWAs has opened up new horizons for investors and enthusiasts  alike. It’s fascinating to see how we can now have a stake in high-value assets through fractional shares, made possible by the amazing approach of tokenization. This shift is not merely about investment; it’s a transformative step towards democratizing asset ownership and making it more accessible to a broader audience.
I’m keen to delve deeper into specific projects within this space. What are your thoughts on the current RWA projects that stand out in terms of their approach to tokenization and overall impact? Are there any particular trends or developments in the RWA space that you find particularly promising or challenging?
I believe this forum is the perfect place to exchange ideas and insights about these emerging trends. Your experiences, thoughts, and predictions could provide invaluable perspectives as we navigate this evolving landscape together.",1

19749,Sebix,2023-11-26 13:00:34,"Hello, Arbitrum community! In light of the ongoing discussion in the Bankless DAO proposal and the post created by Jengajojo on establishing a framework for service providers, the Atoma team wishes to contribute our insights. We’ve crafted a comprehensive framework to address such scenarios. Our goal is to stimulate the discussion around this subject, gather community feedback, and lay the foundation for a robust Arbitrum framework for marketing & growth service providers.
If the community sees value in it, the Atoma team is willing to contribute further to this project.
Introducing a Robust Framework for Arbitrum Service Providers [Marketing & Growth]
Establishing a proper framework for marketing & growth service providers for the Arbitrum protocol involves defining clear guidelines and procedures to ensure transparency, fairness, and efficiency. The Atoma team advocates for the implementation of a comprehensive framework, encompassing the following key elements:

1- Documentation and Proposal Submission.
2- Evaluation Criteria.
3- Community Feedback.
4- Trial Periods.
5- Regular Reviews and Updates.
6- Flexibility and Scalability.
7- Communication Channels.
8- Education.
9- Legal and Compliance Considerations (Optional).

1. Documentation and Proposal Submission
Require service providers to submit detailed documentation outlining their proposed services, methodologies, and expected outcomes.
Service providers interested in contributing to the Arbitrum protocol should be required to submit comprehensive documentation that outlines the specifics of their proposed services. This documentation would serve as a transparent and informative basis for the community and the Arbitrum DAO to evaluate the merit of the proposal. The documentation should include:

Introduction and Background: A brief introduction to the service provider, highlighting their background, expertise, and any relevant experience in the Web3 and blockchain space. Details about the team members involved in the proposed services.
Scope of Services: A clear and detailed description of the services the provider intends to offer to the Arbitrum protocol. Information on how these services align with the needs and goals of the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Methodologies: An explanation of the methodologies and approaches the service provider plans to employ in delivering the proposed services. Technical details on how the services will integrate with the Arbitrum protocol.
Expected Outcomes: Clearly defined expected outcomes and goals of the proposed services. Metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure the success of the services.
Timeline: A proposed timeline for the delivery of services, including key milestones and deadlines. An estimated time frame for the trial or pilot period, if applicable.

Establish a standardized proposal format or template that includes key information such as the provider’s background, experience, and a breakdown of services.
To streamline the evaluation process and ensure consistency in the information provided, the Arbitrum DAO should establish a standardized proposal format. This format will include specific sections for key information, making it easier for community members and DAO participants to review and compare different proposals. The standardized format may include:

Technical Expertise (Score out of 10): Assessing the depth and relevance of the provider’s technical capabilities.
Experience in the Web3 Space (Score out of 10): Evaluating the provider’s history of successful engagements within the broader Web3 ecosystem.
Track Record (Score out of 10): Assigning scores based on the provider’s past achievements, collaborations, and contributions.
Alignment with Core Values (Score out of 10): Scoring the provider’s alignment with the core values and principles of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

The cumulative scores across these criteria would provide an objective measure of each proposal’s merit. This scoring system ensures that the evaluation process remains transparent and consistent, enabling the Arbitrum DAO to make informed decisions when selecting service providers to contribute to the protocol.
3. Community Feedback
Encourage community input on service provider proposals. This can be done through forums, voting mechanisms, or community discussions.
The Arbitrum DAO recognizes the importance of community involvement in decision-making processes. To foster transparency and inclusivity, the DAO should actively encourage community members to provide feedback on service provider proposals. This engagement can take various forms:

Facilitate an open dialogue, allowing community members to express their opinions, concerns, and suggestions regarding each proposal.


Community Discussions: Organize community-led discussions meetings to provide a space for in-depth conversations about proposed services.

Foster an environment where community members can engage directly with service providers, asking questions and seeking clarification.



Consider community sentiment as a factor in the evaluation process.
The Arbitrum DAO should acknowledge the significance of community sentiment as a valuable metric in the evaluation of service provider proposals. While the DAO would maintain a structured evaluation process, it would also take into account the collective opinions and preferences of the community. This consideration ensures that the chosen service providers not only meet technical requirements but also resonate with the broader community’s values and expectations.
The integration of community sentiment into the evaluation process strengthens the decentralized nature of decision-making within the Arbitrum ecosystem. By valuing community feedback, the DAO will make informed decisions that align with the interests and aspirations of its diverse and engaged community members.
4. Trial Periods
Implement trial or pilot periods for selected service providers. This allows the community to assess the actual performance and impact of the proposed services.
The Arbitrum DAO also recognizes the importance of practical assessments in evaluating service providers. To ensure a thorough understanding of the proposed services and their real-world impact, the DAO should implement trial or pilot periods for selected providers. This approach offers several benefits:

Hands-On Evaluation: During the trial period, the community can experience the actual services provided by the selected vendors in a live environment.

This hands-on evaluation allows community members to assess the functionality, usability, and effectiveness of the proposed services.


Real-World Impact: By observing the services in action, the community gains insights into how they contribute to the overall objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Assessing real-world impact ensures that the chosen service providers align with the practical needs and expectations of the community.



Set clear milestones and success metrics for the trial period.
It is crucial to establish transparent criteria for evaluating the success of trial periods. To provide a structured framework for assessment, the DAO should set clear milestones and success metrics, including:

Performance Metrics: Define key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the specific services being trialed.

Establish benchmarks that indicate successful performance in areas such as efficiency, reliability, and user satisfaction.


Community Feedback: Continue to encourage community feedback during the trial period.

Utilize community sentiment as an additional metric for evaluating the success of the services.


Scalability and Adaptability: Assess the scalability and adaptability of the services to changing ecosystem needs.

This proposal is open for discussion. Please, share your thoughts.",1
19749,medocons,2023-11-26 18:45:02,"Hi very good idea. I have some ideas for improvement.
1)Since many of the proposals include an aim to save someone’s time or finances, I suggest as a mandatory part of the proposal to include a cost-benefit analysis (at least in some simplified form).

Since the authors of the proposals are asking for relatively large sums, they should provide a justification why in a given area the final beneficiaries (arbitrum citizens) could not receive a grant directly or through a voucher that they could use with several service providers.
",2
19749,axlvaz_SEEDLATAM.eth,2023-11-27 16:57:36,"I have a question on this:
Is the framework for all types of service providers or is it for marketing and growth providers?",3
19749,Sebix,2023-11-27 18:20:26,"Hey @medocons! Regarding your feedback:
1.- While the cost-benefit analysis may not be explicitly outlined, we believe that the structure of the proposal and its components inherently serves this purpose. Nevertheless, we could integrate a cost-benefit analysis into the framework if community believes is for the best.
2.- Our proposal assumes that centralizing resources through service providers can lead to more efficient and effective outcomes. The choice to allocate funds to service providers rather than directly to Arbitrum citizens or through vouchers is rooted in the complexity of the tasks involved. Service providers are expected to contribute specialized skills and technical expertise that directly impact the functionality and growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, we welcome community feedback on this aspect; we are open to exploring alternative models that align with the community’s preferences.
Thank you for the input :).

@axlvaz_SEEDLATAM.eth Although this framework could be applied to other service providers —with relevant changes— this proposal is intended for marketing & growth service providers. We’ll make sure to clarify this, as we realized the title might be a bit confusing. Thank you for highlighting this!",4
19749,Cole_404,2023-11-27 19:32:38,"Very thorough proposal and one that is needed to formalize frameworks for Service Providers.
I am curious if it would make more sense to have a more general framework for all service providers rather than just marketing and growth. From that you can add additional requirements based on the focus (technical, growth, etc). Therefore, service providers and delegates have uniformity across all processes.
Thanks for pushing this forward!",5
19749,Sebix,2023-11-28 12:28:25,"Hey, @Cole_404. We agree with the importance of uniformity across all processes for service providers. To address this, we would need a more general framework that encompasses various categories of service providers, including technical, growth, UX, analytics, legal, partnerships, and more. First thing would be to define the categories encompassing both current and potential future service providers for Arbitrum.
This approach could provide a standardized foundation applicable to all service providers, ensuring consistency in the evaluation, onboarding, and ongoing collaboration processes.
We could develop specific templates tailored to each category of service providers. This would streamline the submission process, making it easier for both service providers and delegates to navigate.",6
19749,SmolPhil,2023-12-05 13:47:43,"Thank you for posting such a well-structured and comprehensive proposal. I think it hits the key aspects needed for the establishment of a framework for marketing and growth service providers within the Arbitrum ecosystem. My tldr feedback on the proposal is that it might be too strict, by either the scoring system being too narrow or the requirements being too comprehensive (for smaller service providers to be able to comply).
When it comes to 2. who will be evaluating and scoring potential service providers on these criteria? Also, the proposed scoring system seems too narrow, which could exclude potential service providers that would be great at doing the job at hand despite lacking in some areas. For instance, imagine a large marketing company is seeking to expand into crypto and want to partner up with Arbitrum, they will score poorly if the proposed criteria were to be used.
On 4., do we want to implement trial/pilot periods for all of our service providers, and is this practically feasible (without losing a valuable share of potential service providers)?
When it comes to 6. And 7. I have some questions about how to get all of these things of the ground and for 7. specifically, if we really need them all (cost/benefit). It’s very good to see the community/DAO being valued, and I definitely agree to the points made that we need transparency and accountability, but having service providers needing to spend a lot of resources on communication channels will be resource intensive/costly (besides potentially some good service providers not having the resources to do this, yet being good at the marketing/growth side). I would suggest having a core of updates, reporting and channels for issue resolution stay intact, while a committee takes care of the smaller stuff (or even have the committee mediate in certain instances).
These comments and thoughts reflect my personal opinions on this proposal as a member of the Arbitrum Representative Council (ARC). These do not necessarily represent the overall views of the council, Treasure DAO or provide an indication of final voting decision by the ARC.",7
19749,Sebix,2023-12-05 18:28:25,"Hey, @SmolPhil. Thank you for your words and feedback.
We’re currently working to increase flexibility in the evaluation process. We’re hoping to create a more concrete and precise proposal to ensure framework practicality, besides comprehensiveness.
To address concerns about feasibility and potential loss of valuable service providers, we’re considering the establishment of a specialized Marketing, Branding & Growth Council. This council could handle issues such as trial periods, selectively applying them based on factors like integration complexity, service provider experience, or the potential impact of proposed services.
The council could also manage the documentation hub, maintain communication channels, and handle other tasks to alleviate service providers without compromising transparency or accountability. Simultaneously, it could ensure the framework’s flexibility and scalability by instituting a regular review process and addressing necessary amendments.
—
I’d also like to mention that we explored the possibility of creating a single framework for any service provider, but it proved to be too intricate to be effective.",8
19749,Sixty,2023-12-06 07:45:05,"Hey @Sebix , great proposal here that will definitely all the DAO to select the best service providers. However the scope of the framework is pretty broad, my suggestion is to have some sort of Growth Committee / Working group that can keep the different service providers service providers accountable, evolve the framework design, conduct performance reviews, etc.
While this is a great framework, with someone or a group to uphold and regulate the framework, I fear its intend aim and value to the DAO could be lost.",9
14617,rafso,2023-05-22 20:48:06,"Hi Arbitrum DAO!
Raf from Tally here. I wanted to let you know about Delegation Week, which starts today.
Delegation Week is an ecosystem-wide event for DAO governance engagement. There’s a lot going on, including a Arbitrum DAO twitter space. The goal of the week is to build feedback loops between delegates and tokenholders. Delegates can share their platforms and their voting histories. Tokenholders can check that they’re still aligned with their delegate.
This week, eligible ARB holders get one free delegation on Tally. Thanks to Arbitrum Foundation for funding this effort to make it easier to delegate. To be eligible, you had to own at least 40 ARB on May 1st. There’s enough gas to cover the first ~25,000 delegators, depending on gas prices.
If you are a delegate or a tokenholder, visit your Arbitrum Tally Dashboard. From there, you can update your profile, see who you are delegating to, or find a new delegate if you want to change.
If you are a delegate, this week is also a good time do some campaigning! Tell your friends and followers why they might want to delegate their ARB to you. Let them know what you stand for and that they can delegate to you for free from your Tally profile this week. (e.g. here is my Tally Arbitrum profile. ).
Happy Delegation Week! Happy to answer questions.",1

19478,Immutablelawyer,2023-11-10 16:49:17,"Hello everyone,
Immutablelawyer (Joseph) here from [axis advisory]. By way of context, I was recently leading a focus group together with @dk3 so as to spearhead a proposal aimed at creating a ‘Procurement Framework’ for security-oriented service providers in the ArbitrumDAO. Below, please find our public call for your participation in a public consultation phase so as to solicit input on what you, the ArbitrumDAO community member, think of how the Procurement Framework should be structured.
IMP: The Procurement Framework detailed below is merely a base-line framework aimed at being thought-provoking in nature so as to give some context to community members intending on participating in the public consultation.
Your submissions can be made on the following Google Form: ArbitrumDAO [Security Service Provider Procurement Framework] [Public Consultation]
THE CONSULTATION PERIOD: 10/11/2023 - 22/11/2023 (UPDATED) (MIDNIGHT)
If you prefer to submit a document-based submission, please do so by sending it to: joseph@axisadvisory.xyz
Introduction
On the 3rd of November, DK (Premia) posted a proposal on the Arbitrum DAO Forums aimed at establishing a framework for security-oriented proposals via a consolidated framework (Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition). By way of a summary, the proposal on the Arbitrum DAO forum discusses establishing a Request for Proposal (RFP) process to consolidate the selection of auditors and security service providers within the Arbitrum ecosystem (for the purposes of this endeavor, we shall be referring to this consolidated framework as the ‘Procurement Framework).
The Snapshot Vote for the establishment of the aforementioned Procurement Framework has since passed (Snapshot).
The intent is to replace the current piecemeal approach with a structured, transparent, and fair framework, involving stakeholder participation and administered/facilitated by a Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as ‘PC). This would involve clear criteria for security professionals’ experience, qualifications, and pricing to ensure the ecosystem’s security. The process is designed to be inclusive and efficient, open to all security engineers, researchers, and organizations. The committee’s role is not one that will involve any form of gatekeeping, but will merely be there to facilitate this process and carry out certain key functions which are part and parcel of the Procurement Process.
GOALS


Draft a preliminary procurement framework that will be used as a baseline to solicit stakeholder input through a public consultation process. The public consultation period will be initiated on the 10th of November and be open for submissions until the 17th of November.


During the public consultation period (and immediately following the conclusion thereof) , the intermittent focus group will assess submissions, and iterate on the baseline procurement framework provided in [1] so as to propose an optimised procurement framework in line with stakeholder feedback.


Following [1] and [2], the intermittent focus group will submit two proposals to the ArbitrumDAO:



The creation & nomination of members to form part of a procurement committee (referred to as ‘PC’) that will administer & facilitate the checks & balances as envisaged in the procurement process; and
The submission of the final procurement framework for ratification by the ArbitrumDAO through a governance vote.


Following the conclusion of the above mentioned matters, the appointed members of the PC will signal the beginning of the procurement process in line with the ratified procurement framework and administered by the appointed PC.

[Public Consultation Procurement Framework]
1. ‘Needs’ Assessment
Define and document the security needs of the Arbitrum Ecosystem:

What type of security services do projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem need?
Will different services necessitate different procurement processes?

2. Defining Eligibility Criteria

Technical Expertise: Providers must demonstrate expertise in blockchain security, including prior experience with smart contracts, the Ethereum network, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum.
Reputation: A track record of successful security audits, with references and case studies.
Certifications: Relevant industry certifications (e.g., CISA, CISSP, or equivalent).
Compliance: Adherence to international standards for cybersecurity (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001).
Tools and Techniques: Tools for detecting vulnerabilities, including static and dynamic analysis, and formal verification methods.
Financial Stability: Proof of financial stability to ensure the longevity and reliability of the service provider.
Innovation: Evidence of ongoing research and development in the field of blockchain security.
Insurance: Adequate insurance cover for errors and omissions.

3. Publication of the Request for Proposal (RFP)

Scope of Work: Following the conclusion of the ‘Needs Assessment’ in [1], the PC will publish a request for submissions. This will be done via the ArbitrumDAO Forums wherein a detailed description of services required, including security audit scope, frequency, and expected deliverables will be provided by the PC.
Submission Guidelines: Clear instructions on how to apply, including formats and submission channels.
Evaluation Criteria: Metrics on how proposals will be assessed.
Timeline: Submission deadlines and timeline for the evaluation process.

4. Proposal Submission

Documentation: Proposers must submit comprehensive documentation, including company profiles, client testimonials, and detailed descriptions of methodologies.
Demonstration: Providers may be asked to demonstrate their capabilities via a test audit or presentation.
The goal is to establish fair submission periods & submission criteria.
Ideally, submissions should be effected on a dedicated section of the ArbitrumDAO Forums. This way, the PC can already get a sense of community feedback prior to putting the security service provider through the procurement process.

5. Evaluation of Proposals

Initial Screening: Verification of compliance with the minimum eligibility criteria.
Technical Evaluation: In-depth review of technical capabilities, methodologies, and tools.
Commercial Evaluation: Assessment of cost-effectiveness and value for money.
References Check: Verification of the provider’s references and past performance.
Interviews: The PC may conduct interviews with the top candidates.
Emphasis should be placed on documenting each step of the procurement process and communicating select steps in a consolidated manner to the community for review & input.
In this regard, the PC can set up a dedicated notion page wherein the aforementioned details can be inputted, and then linked from the Forum updates posted by the PC.

6. Whitelisting, Onboarding & Contracting

Selection: The PC will select the most suitable providers to be whitelisted for service-subsidies based on them validly passing the procurement process.
The PC will facilitate Know-Your-Business processes so as to make sure that all prospectively whitelisted service providers pass standard KYB checks.
Contract Negotiation: The PC will facilitate & administer the process for the finalization of the contractual provisions regulating the engagement between the service provider chosen by the projects & the project itself. Most importantly, the PC has to ensure that the pricing ‘advertised’ by the service provider for the service requested is consistent with the agreement.
Approval: Final agreements will be reviewed and approved by the PC before signing.

7. Performance Monitoring and Review

Regular Audits: Random checks by the PC during the audit process so as to ensure compliance with SLAs.
Feedback Loop: A system for feedback from the projects utilizing the subsidised services. This will be pivotal in ensuring that the PC maintains a certain level of quality assurance so as to consistently assess whether any factors that led to the service provider passing the procurement process have changed.

8. Renewal and Exit Procedures

Renewal Criteria: Should the PC establish a quarterly/longer time period review process to reassess whitelisted service providers?
Exit Strategy: Process for orderly termination of the service provider from the whitelist? (Example: if a service provider’s performance is unsatisfactory or if they no longer meet the eligibility criteria)

9. Documentation and Record Keeping

Audit Trail: All stages of the procurement process will be documented and records maintained for accountability and transparency.

10. Public Disclosure

Transparency: Key details of the procurement process and the list of whitelisted providers will be made publicly available, respecting confidentiality agreements.
This procurement process is designed to ensure that only the most qualified and reliable security service providers are selected, thereby safeguarding the integrity and security of the projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

We look forward to your participation in the public consultation process & will be active to answer any questions or queries you may have in relation thereto. To reiterate, this is nowhere near the final procurement framework that will be provided for community ratification, but rather a Draft [1] base-level framework so as to solicit community input.
We look forward to receiving your submissions!
Feel free to reach out to me on Telegram @immutablelawyer should you have any questions, queries, or issues with the Google Form!
Kind regards,
Immutablelawyer

Tally Delegation

STIP - Round 1
Following the large amount of proposals for the first STIP round, I believe it’s better to share my thoughts on some macro votes like this one in my own thread instead of divided among each application.  Feel free to discuss about votes here as well, this feels like a great place to communicate with my delegators as well.
I used raholloway’s STIP dashboard to navigate the different votes, and took preference in voting on proposals that:

Did not pass quorum as of my time of voting
Are asking for incentives which will lead to sustainable, ‘sticky’ growth as opposed to mercenary capital (eg. Liquidity Mining)
If possible, offer integrations with other developers or protocols.

Additionally, I wanted to clarify that I personally will just be judging the application itself, as opposed to the initial ARB usage and allocation. This is because many DAOs are organized in such a way that the applicant might not have the ability to decide how those ARB are spent, and since the initial allocation did not specify it had to be used for incentives some DAOs might also use them for other purposes (like Delegation, PoL, etc).
Here’s a few lesser known (for me) protocols that are still not reaching quorum which I think are worth looking at:

Furucombo  :  It’s a simple trading incentives competition, but the ask is reasonable. Could help users onboard to Arbitrum thanks to their intuitive block system.
Magpie : Not familiar with them, but they are collaborating with other protocols like Pendle which is a positive for me.
Notional :  Strong audit history and interesting idea (fixed rate lending). Not comfortable with the funding address being a 2/3 safe, but I think they’re worth at least looking at.

I’m glad to see most of the projects I was planning on supporting passing overwhelmingly FOR, and can’t wait for the next steps!",1

Topic: Community Growth through Educational Content and Events
There were 3 proposals that fall under the aforementioned topic for which we’d like to invite their respective proposers to have a discussion with. Our aim is to help the proposers gather feedback and move forward with their proposals, and for delegates and the broader community to have an opportunity to directly ask questions and form an opinion.
Here are the 3 proposals we’d like to discuss:

Arbitrum as an Official Sponsor for Ethereum Mexico by @brichis
Fund Atoma’s project, a Growth & Communications proposal for Arbitrum by @Sebix
Content Creation proposal by @PatrickAlphaC

When: Tuesday 3 October at 4pm UTC / 12pm EST
Where: Google Meet
Duration: 1 Hour
Format: 5 minutes of brief overview and then 15 minutes of open QnA for each proposal
Second Call
Topic: Protocol Owned Liquidity Discussion
We want to facilitate a discussion around protocol owned liquidity (POL). We are aware of the debate between Sushi and ApeSwap happening in the forums regarding bonds’ program and we’d like to have a discussion to first decide if POL is interesting to the DAO, and then decide where to go from there.
When: Thursday 5 October at 4pm UTC / 12pm EST
Where: Google Meet
Format: Moderated Discussion
Call to Action
We ask delegates and community members who are interested in participating to take a look at the relevant proposals so they’re familiar with them at the time of each call. Furthermore, we urge anyone who has any questions for the proposers to drop them below, or under the respective proposals so the proposers can prepare ahead of time.",1
14142,thinkDecade,2023-04-26 10:57:12,"Title: Proposal: Create a Discord Category Channel for Governance
Constitutional/Non-Constitutional: Non-Constitutional

Abstract
This proposal suggests the creation of a new category channel on the Arbitrum Discord server, specifically dedicated to governance-related discussions.

Motivation
Discourse alone is good, but adding discord to the governance communication stack will make things better. As the Arbitrum ecosystem continues to grow, the need for transparent and open discussions around governance becomes increasingly important. Creating a dedicated category channel on Discord will provide an additional organized space for community members to share their thoughts and ideas about governance and facilitate more efficient decision-making processes.

Rationale
The creation of a governance-focused Discord category channel aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission to promote open and inclusive discussions and will provide a platform for community members to share their opinions and feedback on key governance-related matters. By creating a dedicated space for these discussions, we can ensure that important governance-related topics are easily accessible to the entire community and that more voices are heard. Discord offers more 
Real-time communication <> Back-and-forth, lfg​:speaking_head:
Discord allows for instant messaging and voice communication, which makes it easier for community members to communicate with each other in real time. This can be especially helpful for discussing time-sensitive topics or having quick conversations that don’t necessarily warrant a full forum post. Members can also use this channel to sync on potential governance ideas they are working on which are not fully fleshed out yet for forum posts!
Enhanced community engagement <> Put vibes in governance!
Discord has a more casual and interactive feel compared to the Discourse forum, which can help to foster a sense of community and increase engagement. This can be especially important for governance discussions, as it can encourage more community members to participate in the decision-making process. Discourse is a read, reply, ask-question platform. Makes it a dry place to be lol. Adding discord will ensure that members have a place to hang out and banter in a good vibes way.
Accessibility <> Regardless of your preference, you can partake in governance!
Some community members may prefer to use Discord over the Discourse forum, as it can be more accessible and user-friendly for certain individuals. Providing both options can help to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate in governance discussions, regardless of their preferred communication platform. For folks who don’t like discourse and are more active in Discord, this can be a great way of getting them informed and also onboarding them to discourse to participate more.
Improved organization <> could be chaotic but still organized!
Discord allows for the creation of sub-channels, which can help to keep discussions organized and easy to navigate. This can be especially helpful for governance discussions, which can often cover a wide range of topics and sub-topics. Heck we could even have a delegate thread/channel under this category for delegates to meet and chat about various stuff in a more comfortable and informal setting!
Overall, adding a Discord channel for governance in addition to the Discourse forum can help to create a more well-rounded and accessible communication platform for the community, which can lead to more engagement and participation in the governance process.

Specifications
The proposed Discord category channel will be called “Governance” and will be located under the “Community” category. The channel will be open to all members of the Arbitrum Discord server, but moderation will be required to ensure that discussions remain civil and respectful.

Steps to Implement:

Create a new category channel on the Arbitrum Discord server called “Governance.”
Assign moderators to the new channel to ensure that discussions remain respectful and on-topic.
Announce the new channel in the #announcements channel to inform the community of its existence.
Encourage community members to utilize the new channel for governance-related discussions.


Timeline
This proposal can be implemented within one week of its approval.

Overall Cost
There will be no associated costs with creating the new Discord category channel for governance.
I believe that the creation of a dedicated Discord category channel for governance will promote more inclusive and transparent discussions, and ultimately help to strengthen the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.",1

This is a low cost way to drastically improve engagement and communication in governance hence I am in favor of this initiative",2
14142,Octavio,2023-04-26 20:37:22,Communication is always key if you want to achieve transparency. And since its got costing us low lets not hesitate on it. I think its in the right direction,3

14142,LiviuC,2023-04-27 17:57:45,"I think an additional to discourse will be good as more  are on discord (probably).

Additionaly - thanks for following the template as outlined in “How to submit a DAO Proposal.”
It’s very well done and is a great model for future propsals.",8
14142,Damboy,2023-05-18 03:43:47,"Communication is a major part of a community and it should be taken care of well to improve transparency and accountability.
Since it cost nothing to Create a Discord Category Channel for Governance, i feel it should be considered",9
14142,ZER8,2023-05-18 21:07:48,"This is a really cool proposal and I believe it’s much needed. I’m actually one of those people that believes Discord is invaluable for any community and not many are using it to it’s maximum potential.
Of if the conversation/topic involves a huge amount of people (as it will most likely be the case with Arbitrum) it can sometimes get out of hand and will need really dedicated community manangers/moderators, but it’s still one of the best ways to get in touch with ALL of the people from the community and actually get the pulse and really hear people out.
Can’t wait for this channel to be created as I would love to participate in the conversation and even help out by moderating the discussions. Over time we can create fun activities and even experiments that people would love to participate with the goal of making governance more fun and inclusive for the Arbitrum community ",10

1. Discussion about Security Council elections

Elections are open for applications until Sep 22th. The official elections will begin on Oct 6th and last for 21 days.
A second call is proposed to meet the nominees.
In the future, there will be a call with more time before the application deadline, as it is considered too short to have only 24 hours left.

2. Updates from @gauntlet on Migration report & Recommendations for the USDC.e to USDC migration

Gauntlet is monitoring the situation to provide recommendations, mitigate, and eliminate risks when transitioning from USDC to native USCD.

3. Domain Allocators and Program Manager Updates

The process is already completed.
The RFPs program will be created and launched in the coming weeks.
The first steps will involve effective communication.
They are working on a template that will serve as a request form.
They are in contact with many protocols. They are waiting for the bootstrap, and
The program is expected to be ready for the next calls.

4. Short Term Incentives Program Updates

The snapshot for this program has already been taken.
A budget of a maximum of $50 million will be allocated.
It will start by tracking governance.
It was asked about one of the program requirements, such as KYC and processes

5. GovMonth Update from PluralityLabs

Arbitrum is growing much faster than they anticipated.
They discuss how easy it is to participate in the Gitcoin grant and it was provided an example of how to participate.

6. Updates from the Arbitrum Foundation

KYC process: They have conducted KYC for a couple of events, treasury, and security council elections.
They will also do it for grant processes and incentive programs.
They work with a service called Providence to ensure the process and safe storage of information.
They emphasize that sensitive information will not be put at risk during this process.
The KYC process typically takes 10 days.
They understand the concerns but emphasize the importance of ensuring the process and avoiding any red flags that may arise, especially concerning treasury and security council.
They revisit the Arbitrum Odyssey, which is a continuation of a proposal they made some time ago.

As we try to keep these calls short (if you can call a 90-minute call short), there’s not enough time to go into detail about each topic or upcoming proposal - we think there should be separate, dedicated calls for those interested in those topics that would allow for a deeper dive into them.

Proposal: Decrease Censorship Delay from 24 hours to 4 hours Proposals


Proposal: Decrease Censorship Delay from 24 hours to 4 hours


Category: Constitutional - Core


Submitted by: Shotaro

Abstract
This Proposal proposes to decrease the censorship resistant delay time for transaction force inclusion from 24 hours to 4 hours. 
Moreover, as a consequence, this change restricts the power of the sequencer from backdating transactions down to 4 hours instead of 24 hours. 

Motivation
Arbitrum chains today run in a trusted sequencer mode in which a server operated by …

Bi-weekly Grants & Governance Workshop - August 15, 2023
Attendance: Approximately 11 participants
Call Introduction.
During the initial segment of the call, participants shared their discussion topics using sticky notes.
Item 1: Delegate’s Incentives.
The discussion commenced with the “delegate incentives” sticky note, given its high priority.
After setting the priorities, participants had an opportunity to inquire about other sticky note topics, with the most pertinent questions being addressed.
Considerable interest was expressed regarding payment for delegates and the system to prevent conflicts of interest.
Members were encouraged to provide comments and pose questions on the SeedLatam RFC-2 proposal, accessible here:



[RFC-2] Delegate Incentive System for ArbitrumDAO Proposals


Request For Comments: Delegate Incentive System for ArbitrumDAO
Introduction
Encouraging active and efficient participation in governance is crucial to optimizing Arbitrum’s current structure. Therefore, we propose a discussion about introducing an incentive system for delegates whose role in the Arbitrum ecosystem is vital. 
It is crucial to discuss establishing an incentive system that provides delegates with constant, attractive, and predictable rewards. To scale governance, it is essential t…
  

Item 2: Arbitrum Licenses
The second point of discussion involved licenses issued by Offchain Labs for projects seeking to utilize Nitro technology.
Considerable debate arose over the application process and the trustworthiness of Offchain Labs. From my perspective, two opposing viewpoints exist:

Restricting arbitrum nitro licensing could dissuade developers from using Arbitrum, but it would ensure committed projects align with the ecosystem’s vision.
Alternatively, facilitating easy licensing for numerous projects could lead to chain forks and potential scams. Nevertheless, wider distribution of arbitrum software could expose technology performance variations, aiding in identifying weaknesses and strengths for a more robust and secure ecosystem in the long run.

Agenda Item 3: Forum Timing
A suggestion was made for a quarterly system, involving planning in the first month, participation in the second, and evaluation in the third.
Due to time constraints, the discussion on this topic remained incomplete.",2

Community Call Notes

We talked about introducing a moderation policy for the public governance forums.


Maximum politeness policy
Unconstructive comments shouldn’t get posted
It was pointed out that a policy already exists by default in the forum.



The Forum is theoretically in possession of the Foundation and is run on behalf of the DAO.


A discussion around Arbitrum’s stack licensing was started by Peter McCorry of the Arbitrum Foundation. A separate call to talk specifically about licensing will be set up by Peter.


Coin Flip of GMX brought a question regarding an incentives framework and a discussion was started on that front.


There’s no framework and there’s no need to necessarily wait to submit a proposal for incentives, but its tone is important.


We had an overview of a proposal from Rari from the Rarible team and discussed setting up a separate call to discuss the proposal in more detail. The proposal wasn’t public at the time of the discussion, but was shared at a later time and can be found here.


We discussed the proposal from Camelot and the proposal from Questbook.


The issue was raised by people who erroneously sent their ARB tokens to the ARB contract address. There’s a group on Telegram with users who have this issue and Krzysztof of L2Beat will work with them to try and see how to resolve the situation.

During this session, we delved into engaging discussions about the active proposals on the forum and received interesting updates from the Arbitrum foundation. It was a valuable opportunity to exchange ideas and insights between delegators.
I am pleased to share the minuta of the meeting with all of you right below.
OPEN GOVERNANCE CALL #4 (26/07/2023)
Attendance: aprox 28 users
Agenda:

Discussion on recent proposals

Reflection and discussion on Camelot’s proposal
Questbook’s Grant Framework proposal
Update Security Council Election Start Date to Ensure Time for Security Audit
Updated Rari proposal
any other proposals that we might want to discuss (please mention them in comments so that we can prepare to discuss them)


Updates from the Foundation

Foundation Grants programme and its’ relationship with DAO Grants Frameworks
Other topics from the Foundation


Other issues related to delegates that need to be discussed (please mention them in the comments upfront if possible so that we can prepare for discussion)

Foundations updates
Grants program

There was a discussion about the foundation’s grants program.
The foundation wants to complement any grants program active in the DAO, to cover other areas that have not been mentioned in the grants proposed in the forum.

Forum Moderation


The foundation raises the idea of introducing moderators in the Forum in order to improve the productivity of the forum. In short, to be more polite. There was a great acceptance for this by those present.


There is a comment about encouraging constructive comments and avoiding the appearance of offensive and non-objective comments.


It is suggested to address all this with a non-constitutional AIP and to be suggested by the foundation.


L2 licensing


The foundation has discussed with partners the possibility to provide them a L2 license (to use the Arbitrum Nitro Tecnology). The foundation wonders what the DAO’s position will be with this.


The presents considered important to investigate the partner that will have the license, also the benefits or incentives that this will bring to the ecosystem.


It is felt that the more people use the arbitrum L2 stack, the better the value and robustness of it will be in the future, as it will give the possibility to evaluate its performance from different areas.


Discussion on recent proposals:


Rarible.


Camelot.


Questbook.

By reviewing this minuta, I hope than you’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of the topics covered and the discussion than the delegators and participants had.

15592,MidnightLightning,2023-07-26 05:36:04,"The Arbitrum One and Nova chains currently enforce a floor gas price (currently 0.1 gwei on Arbitrum One and 0.01 gwei on Nova), which is described in the developer documentation. However, that guide doesn’t indicate WHY there is a gas floor price enforced at all.
I’ve heard it mentioned (and got one response in Discord confirming) it’s to prevent certain attack vectors/spamming/DoSing of the chain, but nowhere is detailed if that’s a temporary thing, or a permanent thing.
I’m posting this as a Governance discussion as I think a long-term plan should be decided-upon, and whatever that plan is, to make it more clear to developers and users.
Assumption: It would be ideal for end-users if a gas floor price was not enforced, or if it was enforced, it was as low as possible.
Assumption: There is a current possible attack vector that the current-enforced gas floor price makes it financially not possible for a bad actor to sustain.
Therefore, questions I think needing clear answers:

Is the attack vector the gas floor price is guarding against expected to always exist? (If it’s expected to eventually become obsolete, the gas floor price could be retired at that time)
Are there other guards against this attack vector possible (theoretical, planned, or in development)? (If there’s better guards against that attack vector, the gas floor price could be phased out when they’re enacted)
Is a planned step-down of the gas floor price over time possible (without risking the security/usability of the chain)?
Why is Nova able to exist with a lower gas floor price compared to One?
Would a governance proposal to reduce the gas floor price at a certain rate (e.g. reduce by 0.001 gwei/year) be a good idea? What ramifications would that have that would need to be addressed before enacting?

Depending on what the answers are, an update to the documentation explaining why it will not be changing may be all that’s needed. But if it is possible to step down those limits, creating a governance proposal to do so could be the next step?",1
15457,ar1,2023-07-17 20:50:51,"Is it possible to have a function like:
a.) For those proposals to transact with a new counter-party:

Create a Discord Category Channel for Governance Governance


    Title: Proposal: Create a Discord Category Channel for Governance 
Constitutional/Non-Constitutional: Non-Constitutional 

Abstract
This proposal suggests the creation of a new category channel on the Arbitrum Discord server, specifically dedicated to governance-related discussions. 

Motivation
Discourse alone is good, but adding discord to the governance communication stack will make things better. As the Arbitrum ecosystem continues to grow, the need for transparent and open discussions aroun…
  

",5
14046,brianfakhoury,2023-04-26 12:09:24,"Discord sounds like a good place to host the voice call, let’s do it. I agree with @krst that we should start next week. From there we can begin a cadence.
Next steps:

Who are the relevant Discord mods?
What format and agenda would work?
How can we best accommodate the most timezones?
",6
14046,cattin,2023-04-26 12:45:40,"Hey, this is a great idea! Ideally, we should do this on Arbitrum’s discord so that the rest of the community can also get involved, and regarding the timezone, I guess maybe EST works best for me - but we can def ask around and see what’s best.",7
14046,thinkDecade,2023-04-26 15:27:10,"Yhup, we can view the first one as a pilot. these are some action items I would say we flesh out.

Create an agenda format
Agree on day and time for the call. I suggest that time should be qouted in UTC, which is more universal. folks can then convert to their respective timezones if they have to.
Call for moderators, we could have 1 or 2 per call.
",8
14046,Benjamin.lens,2023-04-26 16:42:22,"hey ser, I think this is a wonderful idea! There is for sure a lot to discuss.",9
14046,inkymaze,2023-04-26 17:00:26,I’m in from the @gauntlet side. We are a delegate but also support Compound and Aave deployments on Arbitrum.,10
14046,Deezy,2023-04-27 05:00:03,"I am for this!
Although I am in Asia time zone, so hopefully the time difference won’t be too  bad",11
14046,krst,2023-04-27 11:43:10,"So here’s my proposal:

Time: I propose to do it on Wed, 03.05. It’s obviously impossible to pick up a time that works for all timezones so I propose 4pm UTC which is ok for Europe and US and still probably doable for Asia. Otherwise we can choose 2 different timeslots if there’s enough interest.
Platform: Discord would be probably the most suitable but I don’t have much experience with organising calls there and we’d probably need to coordinate with somebody with privileges for the official Discord channel. Furthermore, I’m not sure if it’s possible to have screen sharing on Discord. Thus for the first call I propose to do it on Google Meet (link below) and in the future we can decide to use anything else.
For the agenda and format, let’s discuss it here (I propose some topics below). I can moderate at first (or share this with somebody) and we can rotate this role later on.
I would like to also invite some Foundation representatives to the call.

If that works for us then here is the calendar event and the call link.
The agenda that I propose for the first call:

Discussion on the topic Proposal: Return funds to arb users who sent their airdrop tokens to the contract address

Discussion on the topic: Proposal: Count ARB Balance in QiDao Vaults into Voting Power also discussed in Proposal: Include LPs in Gov Voting

Discussion on the DAO Grants Programme as discussed in [1] [2] [3] and [4]

Open discussion on how should we frame ArbitrumDAO Governance and how should DAO maintain relationship with Arbitrum Foundation.
Questions + Open Mic

What do you think? Please keep in mind that all above is just my proposal to have something concrete on the table, but feel free to suggest any changes.",12
14046,Augustus,2023-04-27 12:37:12,Yea. I think this would a good idea. Could it even be recorded and stored on an IPFS server for everyone to listen back to?,13

[Request for Comment - Draft Proposal] Building a Pluralist Grants Framework - Milestone 1

Workshop & Async Feedback Opportunities
Thanks to everyone who has given feedback so far, it has been incredibly helpful!
We have taken your feedback and crafted a Version 2 of the Arbitrum Pluralistic Grants Program. Our next step on this cocreation journey is to collect your insight on specific aspects of the V2 proposal to allow us to better assess which elements are working, and which need further revisions. . To enable this we are using a tool called Ethelo to help have quality asynchronous conversations. It will help best structure the conversation and lead to better outcomes where everyone has a voice.

 OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASK:
Review the new proposal at arbitrum.ethelo.net 
Must submit your input and comments by 5pm UTC on Monday, 6/19

OTHER GREAT WAYS TO PARTICIPATE
Open Delegates Workshop - Thursday 6/15 at 8pm UTC
In this one-off event we will be splitting our time between Mural and Ethelo to have a clear conversation with delegates about this proposal.
 Add to Calendar 
Bi-Weekly Grants & Governance Workshops - Tuesdays at 2pm UTC
(First one on Tuesday, the 20th)
These bi-weekly facilitated sessions will be made open to all delegates and teams/individuals contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Hosted workshops will use design thinking to better understand the problems we are facing, align our conversations, and find better solutions.
 Add to calendar 
I know not everyone will be able to make a last minute invite for the workshop. Hopefully, the Ethelo tool will help us to be better async. Shout out to the stewards who have commented previously: @gauntlet @tnorm @Bob-Rossi @Frisson @CryptochicaSEEDLatam @Bobbay and others!

14046,Manugotsuka,2023-07-01 18:48:06,"Hello Guys! From SeedLatam, @cattin and I started this work to create Minutas after each Open Governance Meeting. There is the Minuta of the First Open Governance Call. So you guys can check it if you didn’t have the chance to participate on it.
Arbitrum Open Governance Call #1
Attendance (aprox. 22 people): Krzystof from L2beat, Patrick from Arbitrum Foundation, Max from Lemma, and more governance members.
Talk about refunding users who sent their tokens to the contract address.

A brief description of the problem.
Foundation’s response (Patrick) says DAO should decide.
Tokens sent to the contract are considered burnt.
People keep sending funds to the contract.
If users can be refunded, how would it work? (Krystof).
If someone proposes a solution, the foundation will support on technical and security issues.

Talk about QiDAO tokens and LP tokens, discussion about if it should be considered into the DAO as voting power.

The majority of the speakers agreed to find a way to make it.
Foundation suggests following the format for presenting AIPs proposed by the constitution.

DAO Grants

Check for updates on Monday (Said by Lemma).
A proposal template will be released.
Legal issues associated with Grants should be considered.
Question: Will ArbitrumDAO be like Optimism?.
Answers: Suggests using the Optimism framework (copy-paste type).
Users talk about their ideas on how to set up a grant program.

Relationship between the DAO and the foundation.
The foundation has decision-making power over the treasury funds and ecosystem improvements. The foundation will align with it. However, due to regulatory issues, the foundation will maintain powers to approve or reject AIPs for such cases.
Conclusion
This was a little minuta about the talk that the delegators had in that moment. Thank you so much for reading this and We hope to bring you more minutas in the future.",35

15071,jengajojo,2023-06-26 09:09:29,"Summary
We have seen two service [1 , 2] providers make pitches to start a grants program and there has been a lot of discussion on the details. Perhaps it’s easier for us as a DAO to agree on a neutral ’ Service Provider Framework ’ so that we can be more efficient with this process and allow the DAO to measure the performance of providers on neutral terms
Overview
While the conversation started out with grants, there could be a diverse array of services the DAO could need and this framework should be domain agnostic and comprehensive. These are initial prompts to kick off the discussion on what information the DAO should request from each proposal:


Service Provider Onboarding:

Application Process: Define a clear process for service providers to apply, including submission requirements such as a portfolio, CV, or proposal.
Evaluation Criteria: Establish criteria to evaluate service provider applications, such as relevant experience, skills, past work, and alignment with the DAO’s values and goals.
Selection Process: Outline the steps involved in selecting service providers, which may include voting, review by a committee, or a combination of both.



Service Provider Offboarding:

Termination: Define conditions under which the contract with a service provider can be terminated, such as non-performance, breach of terms, or completion of the agreed-upon work.
Transition Plan: Ensure a smooth transition by outlining procedures for transferring knowledge, assets, and ongoing responsibilities to another service provider or DAO members.
Feedback and Evaluation: Encourage feedback from both the DAO and the service provider on their experiences working together, to identify areas of improvement and address any concerns.



Duration and Scope:

Duration: Clearly specify the duration of the service provider’s engagement, whether it’s a fixed-term contract, an ongoing arrangement, or a project-based engagement.
Scope of Work: Define the specific tasks, responsibilities, and objectives expected from the service provider, including any milestones or deliverables.



Past Work and Experience:

Portfolio or References: Request service providers to submit their portfolio, past work samples, or references to evaluate their capabilities and track record.
Experience Requirements: Define the minimum level of experience or qualifications necessary for service providers to be considered for engagement with the DAO.



Cost Breakdown and Payment:

Cost Structure: Clearly define how the service provider’s fees or costs will be determined. This can include hourly rates, fixed fees, or a detailed breakdown of costs for each deliverable or phase.
Payment Schedule: Establish a payment schedule, including milestones or specific dates for payment. Define the preferred payment method and any applicable terms, such as invoicing or automatic payments.



Performance and Quality Assurance:

Performance Metrics: Define key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics to measure the service provider’s performance and ensure they meet the DAO’s expectations.
Quality Assurance: Specify any quality control processes or standards that service providers must adhere to, ensuring the delivery of high-quality work.



Intellectual Property:

Intellectual Property: Clarify ownership rights of any intellectual property created during the engagement.



Dispute Resolution:

Mediation or Arbitration: Establish a procedure for resolving disputes between the DAO and service providers, such as mediation or arbitration, to avoid legal conflicts.



Continuous Evaluation and Improvement:

Regular Review: Conduct periodic evaluations of service providers to assess their performance, alignment with the DAO’s goals, and ongoing value.
Iterative Enhancements: Continuously improve the service provider framework based on feedback, lessons learned, and changing needs



These are just some points chatGPT helped me come up with, but this is just suggestions. What do you all think?",1
15071,DisruptionJoe,2023-06-26 14:21:59,"I think this is moving in the right direction, however, I’m not sure how it is any different that what AIP - 3 [Non-Constitutional] Fund the Arbitrum Grants Framework Proposal Milestone 1 - #9 by Frisson is posting. Most of that proposal is to design the best way to answer all of the questions you put above.
It seems that you’re considering service providers to be receiving funds that are not “grants”. Is this correct?
Perhaps the glossary is undefined so we talk past each other in some ways.
I’d consider “Program Managers” to be “Service providers” which are given responsibility for directing funds to provide an outcome for the community.
The issue I’ve seen across DAOs is that the DAO delegates don’t have time to do the above work. That brings us to the chicken and egg problem which the AIP-3 is attempting to solve.",2
15071,jengajojo,2023-07-03 10:10:56,"You bring good points @DisruptionJoe
a. On the point of delegates doing governance work, I’d like to see if @Frisson and the Tally team have any stats they want to share about governance participation in DAOs across time. In my experience, DAOs which do not compensate delegates for actively participating in governance often are not well governed. Therefore I’d encourage the community think about governance incentives from the getgo. I wonder if the foundation has any plans here? CC:@stonecoldpat
b. On the point about service provider fees vs grants, they could be the same thing, and ideally the pluralistic grants framework would be able to identify the best providers to give repeated grants to, but till then this remains a test awaiting experimental results.
Finally, we have seen more proposals such as

During this session, we delved into engaging discussions about the active proposals on the forum and received interesting updates from the Arbitrum foundation. It was a valuable opportunity to exchange ideas and insights between delegators.
I am pleased to share the minuta of the meeting with all of you right below.
Open Governance Call #3 Minuta (June 28, 2023)
Attendance. 24 people.
Agenda:

AIP-1.1 and AIP-1.2 have passed, what’s next?
Discussion on the problem with AIP-1.1.
Update from the foundation on current problems.
Security Council elections
The question of whether off-chain changes require on-chain voting.
Other issues.

Proposals to discuss:

Activate support for account abstraction endpoint on One and Nova.
Grant Framework.
Rarible Protocol - Arbitrum Integration Proposal.
Other proposals.

Notes in the meeting
AIP-1.1 and AIP-1.2 have passed, what’s next?
Basically, after these proposals and the voting process, they will be implemented and go into effect.
Discussion on the problem with AIP-1.1


There was an error in a timestamp that was not critical but was still initially included in AIP-1.1 and the proposal could not be cancelled once it was proposed, so another one had to be made.


They propose that the foundation hire someone to audit the onchain proposals and make sure that the specs being used are correct.


Discussion about separating the auditor from the proposer.


Foundation updates
Update 1:
Anuja Khatri (from the Arbitrum foundation) is working on a grant program for infrastructure and DEVs. According to her, it is a small grant program and will take a couple of weeks, tentatively between July 15 and 17.
Observations of the update 1:

Applications for the grant program will be reviewed by the foundation team.
The foundation says it will be private.
A notion will be put together with more details for the next community call - should have it ready around July 15.

Update 2:
There will be an ambassador program (under development) tentatively in September.
It will be composed in 2 phases:

The first phase is open to any university/student to apply.
The second phase is for anyone who wants to be an ambassador to join.

Basically what they are looking for is that ambassadors serve to create content and also serve as a bridge between arbitrum and the communities they represent.
PROPOSALS:
Activate support for account abstraction endpoint on One and Nova.
There were no contradictions to this proposal. As it will be a nice update to Ethereum that Arbitrum already plans to implement.
Grant Frameworks
There were comments about Disruption Joe’s proposal, about the approach to it and the scope they are looking for with it.
Rarible Protocol - Arbitrum Integration Proposal
The possible integration of Rarible protocol in Arbitrum and the benefits it would bring with it were discussed. Also the idea of creating a community marketplace of NFTs for Arbitrum was expressed.
Other proposals (Link)
There was an excellent acceptance of this proposal where the idea is presented to have clear guiding criteria to avoid confusion in the future, especially for those new usersof the DAO.
Conclusion
By reviewing this minuta, I hope than you’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of the topics covered and the discussion than the delegators and participants had.

Introduction
AIP-1.1 and AIP-1.2 - what about onchain voting? What’s the progress? Should we do anything?
Updates from the Foundation
Open discussion regarding the active forum topics
Questions + Open Mic

AIP-1 and AIP-2

Background work is being done to enable the proposal to be made on-chain (e.g., auditing the vesting contract).
It should be ready this week.
A delegate with the minimum % is needed to submit the proposal - Kryz volunteers.

Foundation Updates

They will soon publish the grants program, aiming to complement any DAO program.
They are hiring people. It was mentionabout at least 3 more director.
Opportunities for economic compensation for contributions to the DAO are being explored - not everyone knows this is possible, so better communication is needed.
There was a discussion on how to involve more people in the DAO.

Open discussion on active forum topics

There is concern about the low number of users able to propose an AIP, which gives “centralization vibes” and leads to apathy when voting.
The filtering process for publishing AIPs is being discussed, exploring ways to make constitutional AIPs more visible for easier interaction with the forum.
Different avenues for experimentation, such as quadratic funding and retro funding, are compared.
Discussions are held regarding different grants DAO programs, trying to determine the most suitable one (the following were recommended: https://messari.io/report/state-of-dao-funding and https://questbook.mirror.xyz/B-DCvez3OGGTJ7dYM2oXndXvjeOmxYC3Tp2fOZvZfvI)

Enhancing Grant Programs for Decentralized Projects: Challenges and Solutions

Introduction
Grant programs play a pivotal role in the success of various projects, particularly decentralized ones. They act as a lifeline for public infrastructure, attract talented builders, and cultivate an ecosystem of skilled participants. Despite their importance, executing grant programs effectively is notoriously challenging due to misalignments between stakeholders, cost underestimations, and other issues. In this article, we will discuss these challenges and offer suggestions for improvement, drawing on insights from the CEO and Co-founder of Tally.xyz, to help enhance Arbitrum grant programs and create awesome things together.

Introducing Myself
My name is Dennison Bertram, CEO and Co-founder of Tally.xyz and an Arbitrum Delegate. I previously founded DappHero and served as the first Developer Advocate at OpenZeppelin. Tally played a key role in Arbitrum’s initial decentralization, and we’ve gained valuable insights from working with numerous DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem. In this post, I’ll summarize our experiences and lessons learned from grant programs, which are crucial to the success of large-scale public infrastructure projects like Arbitrum.

The Importance of Grant Programs
Grant programs are critical to the success of projects for several reasons:


They support public infrastructure and independent builders who require funding for their efforts. Without grant programs, many valuable projects would struggle to attract the necessary resources and talent to make an impact.


They incentivize talented builders to enter the ecosystem and provide value through their work. By offering financial incentives, grant programs attract skilled professionals who contribute their expertise to drive innovation and growth.


They help contributors allocate their time and resources to projects that can support their real-world needs. Grants enable builders to focus on projects that have the potential to generate sustainable income and create meaningful impact.


They grow an ecosystem of experienced participants, fostering a community where the best minds compete to provide ever-greater value. As more individuals and teams join the ecosystem, they share knowledge, collaborate, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.



Challenges of Grant Programs
Grant programs face numerous challenges, including:
1. Misalignment between grant committees, grantees, projects, and communities.
Different stakeholders may have conflicting goals and priorities, leading to inefficiencies and tensions in the grant distribution process.
2. Underestimation of the costs of building working projects.
Communities may not fully understand the financial requirements of developing high-quality software or infrastructure, resulting in insufficient funding for projects to succeed.
3. Failure to calculate the real-world costs of receiving grants, such as taxation.
Communities may be unaware that a significant portion of grant funding may be lost to taxes, limiting the resources available to grantees.
4. Inadequate consideration of grant recipients’ cost of living.
Communities may unintentionally impose unfair financial burdens on grantees by failing to account for regional differences in living expenses.
5. Difficulty aligning grants with the long-term goals of the parent project.
Grants committees may struggle to allocate resources effectively due to a lack of clear guidance or understanding of the parent project’s objectives.
6. The prevalence of decentralization theater, which can lead to stagnation and project death.
Grants programs that prioritize appearances over substance may become vulnerable to insider capture, inflated award amounts, and diminished oversight.
7. Difficulty fulfilling grant expectations and ensuring follow-up from the parent organization.
Grantees may not receive adequate support or feedback from the parent organization, limiting the potential impact and adoption of their work.
8. A lack of clear rules and support for grantees.
Unclear expectations and insufficient guidance can leave grantees feeling overwhelmed or unsupported, leading to subpar project outcomes.
9. Inefficient allocation of resources and misaligned incentives for successful grantees.
The grant distribution process may not adequately reward top talent, resulting in reduced motivation and suboptimal project outcomes.
10. Structural resistance to new ideas and risk averse behavior
Poorly designed stakeholder involvement in grants programs can lead to “death by committee” where little novel or pioneering work is accomplished because the penalty for failure outweighs the benefits of exploration.

Solutions for Improving Grant Programs
Despite these challenges, grant programs remain crucial for the success of decentralized projects. Here are some suggestions for enhancing grant programs:
1. Fund more research:
Research grants can justify their own future work streams and help identify new topics for grants. By supporting research, grant programs can encourage the exploration of cutting-edge ideas that drive innovation and growth in the ecosystem.
2. Implement an RFP process:
Request for Proposals (RFP) can help align expectations and requirements between grant committees and grantees. By clearly outlining project goals, scope, and deliverables, RFPs can help attract the right talent and ensure that resources are allocated efficiently. Not all grants need to be RFPs, but for large or core grants RFP processes can identify the best candidates for a grant, enhance transparency on selection process, and foster collaboration opportunities between teams.
3. Foster mentorship opportunities:
Connecting grantees with experienced mentors within the parent organization can provide valuable guidance and support. These relationships can help grant recipients overcome challenges and contribute valuable feedback to the ecosystem. A mentor program itself can be a valuable grant, although selection of mentors should be thoughtful and mentors compensated with vesting tokens to ensure the role is taken seriously. Oversight can be done via anonymous feedback.
4. Encourage collaboration between grantees:
Fostering collaboration among grant recipients can lead to the sharing of knowledge, skills, and resources. This collaborative environment can drive innovation and improve the overall quality of projects within the ecosystem. Where possible, grants processes should strive to incorporate collaboration between recipients.
5. Develop clear guidelines and expectations:
Providing clear guidelines, timelines, and expectations for grant recipients can help ensure that projects stay on track and meet their objectives. This transparency can also help prevent misunderstandings and promote accountability.
6. Regular progress reporting and feedback:
Requiring grantees to submit regular progress reports can help grant committees monitor project development and provide necessary feedback. This ongoing communication can help identify potential issues early and ensure that projects are on track to meet their objectives.
7. Create a tiered grant system:
Implementing a tiered grant system can help allocate resources more efficiently and reward top talent. By offering different levels of funding based on project success and impact, grant programs can motivate grantees to deliver high-quality results.
8. Consider the cost of living and taxation when allocating grants:
To ensure that grantees receive adequate support, grant committees should take into account regional cost-of-living differences and tax implications when determining grant amounts. This consideration can help reduce financial burdens on recipients and improve project outcomes. This should not be used to penalize recipients in higher cost of living localities, but rather the ground expectations around cost for non-bounty style grants which aim to cover the costs of development, rather than reward some action after the fact.
9. Foster a transparent and inclusive grant decision-making process:
Involving the community in the grant decision-making process can help reduce the risk of decentralization theater and promote fair resource allocation. By fostering transparency and inclusivity, grant programs can maintain the trust and support of their communities.
10. Provide ongoing support and resources:
Offering continued support and resources to grant recipients can help ensure their projects’ long-term success. This support can include mentorship, networking opportunities, access to tools and resources, and ongoing feedback and guidance. Many grants fail to make a significant impact due to the lack of followup, or alignment. While not all grants need to continue past their deliverable, should there be ongoing costs to the success of a grant, there should be funding in place to support that with a clearly defined scope of lifetime.
11. Diversify grant committees:
Forming multiple grant committees with diverse expertise can help ensure that projects across various fields are accurately assessed and supported. This approach can lead to a more balanced allocation of resources and foster innovation across different sectors.
12. Encourage research-focused grants:
By funding more research projects, grant programs can support the development of new ideas and technologies. Research grants can help uncover new areas for exploration and inspire further innovation within the ecosystem.
13. Offer flexible grant structures:
Providing various grant structures, such as seed funding or follow-on funding, can cater to the unique needs of different projects. This flexibility can help support a diverse range of projects and contribute to the overall success of the ecosystem.
14. Implement performance-based incentives:
Depending on the nature and goals of a grants program, Introducing performance-based incentives, such as token rewards(vested), can motivate grantees to deliver higher-quality results. These incentives can also help grantees feel more valued for their contributions to the ecosystem.
15. Develop an “upgrade” path for successful grantees:
Establishing a clear path for successful grantees to receive additional support or funding can help ensure that their projects continue to grow and thrive. This approach can also help retain top talent within the ecosystem. While grant programs do not need to operate as “funds”, the ability for grantees to receive follow on investment can help grow the prestige of grants programs and accrue long term value to the ecosystem.
16. Ensure legal and regulatory compliance:
Grant programs should adhere to all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including taxation and corporate governance. Compliance can help maintain the integrity and credibility of the grant program while protecting the interests of all stakeholders. Legal structures, such as an LLC with bylaws that define and constrain their roles and responsibilities can protect committee members from liability and unforeseen legal complications.
17. Maintain transparency and accountability:
Ensuring that grant programs operate with transparency and accountability can help build trust within the community and demonstrate the program’s commitment to supporting high-quality projects. Transparent processes can also help mitigate any potential conflicts of interest or other concerns. Grant committee members should be required to disclose conflicts of interest and be properly informed as to the processes required for dealing with material non public information to prevent accusations of self-dealing or insider trading.
18. Implement robust application processes:
A thorough and transparent application process can help ensure that grants are awarded to projects with the greatest potential for success. This approach can also help maintain the integrity and credibility of the grant program. In general, it is often best if the grant committee determines grant recipients, rather than by election of the community, but it is quite acceptable to promote on occasion a “people’s choice” category to provide inclusiveness for unexpected proposals.
19. Encourage community engagement and feedback:
Inviting input from the community throughout the grant process can help identify potential areas of improvement and ensure that projects align with community needs and values. This engagement can also help foster a sense of ownership and investment among community members. Opportunity for community feedback should be, where reasonably possible, constrained to specific periods of comment. Grant recipients should not be required to respond to community feedback and comment at random which can promote insecurity and undermine confidence. Feedback should also be collated and delivered in one document, rather than requiring recipients to read through continuously expanding forum threads.
20. Monitor and track project progress:
Regularly monitoring the progress of grant-funded projects can help identify any potential issues or roadblocks and ensure that resources are being used effectively. This oversight can also help maintain accountability and encourage grant recipients to stay on track with their project goals.
21. Celebrate and share grant successes:
Acknowledging and celebrating the achievements of grant recipients can help motivate and inspire others within the ecosystem. Recognition can also help build a sense of community and camaraderie among grant recipients, grant committees, and parent organizations. Too often grants programs fail to adequately promote the success of their grantees and their efforts. Communities should ensure that being a recipient of a grant is considered prestigious. This should be more than just a tweet or blog post.
22. Foster a culture of innovation and excellence:
Cultivating an environment that values innovation, creativity, and excellence can help attract top talent and encourage grant recipients to strive for exceptional outcomes. This culture can contribute to the overall success and growth of the ecosystem. This means an open mind to wild or untested ideas, but also accountability and intellectual rigor.
23. Encourage diversity and inclusion:
Promoting diversity and inclusion within grant programs can help ensure that a wide range of perspectives, ideas, and experiences are represented. This approach can lead to more innovative and well-rounded projects, benefiting the entire ecosystem. Diversity and inclusion should also take into consideration language and geographic location. To the extent possible and practical, major non-english languages should be accommodated.
24. Develop clear communication channels:
Establishing clear communication channels between grant committees, the community, parent organizations, and grant recipients can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards common goals. Effective communication can also help address any issues or concerns that may arise during the grant process. Where it’s not possible to keep the parent organization involved due to legal constraints, grant committees can refer to their charter to help align expectations in public.
25. Implement periodic evaluations:
Regularly evaluating grant programs can help identify areas of improvement, assess the impact of funded projects, and determine the overall effectiveness of the program. These evaluations can provide valuable insights for refining and optimizing future grant cycles. Committee members should provide evaluations initially in private, especially when there are potential issues to give grant recipients an opportunity to address concerns they may be unaware of. Following a round of internal feedback, an amended evaluation and feedback can be shared with the community. It is important to recognize that when dealing with grant recipients of diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences on the internet, it is normal that there might be a misalignment. Poorly executed public evaluations can lead to grant recipients being publicly shamed and maligned over even the smallest of mistakes or misunderstandings.
26. Cultivate a supportive community:
Fostering a supportive and collaborative environment within the grant ecosystem can help grant recipients feel more connected and engaged, leading to increased motivation and success. Encouraging a sense of camaraderie can also promote the sharing of ideas and resources, benefiting all participants.
27. Encourage risk-taking and experimentation:
Supporting projects that take risks and push boundaries can help drive innovation and uncover new possibilities. Grant programs should embrace experimentation and be willing to fund projects that may not have guaranteed outcomes but have the potential for significant impact. Moonshot grants need their own form of accountability when deliverables are unclear or potentially not possible. In these cases open development, public working groups, and public forums for updates can substantially derisk projects that are otherwise difficult to measure.
28. Establish a strong feedback loop:
Creating a robust feedback loop between grant recipients, grant committees, and parent organizations can help ensure that all parties are continuously learning from one another and adapting to changing circumstances. This feedback process can also help identify areas for improvement and inform future grant program decisions. The feedback loop also provides a strong communication tool to future grantees about expectations and process for being successful in the grants program.
29. Establish clear metrics for success:
Defining clear metrics for success can help grant programs evaluate the effectiveness of funded projects and determine the overall impact of the program. These metrics can also guide grant recipients in focusing their efforts and resources on areas that contribute to the program’s goals. Success metrics can be difficult to meaningfully measure, but they should be metrics that depend primarily on the effort and capabilities of the grant recipient. Metrics that require buy in or collaboration from other organizations or groups often leave recipients without sufficient control over their grant success.
30. Share best practices and lessons learned:
Encouraging the sharing of best practices and lessons learned can help grant recipients and grant committees learn from each other’s experiences and improve their approaches. This shared knowledge can also benefit the entire ecosystem, driving growth and innovation. Opportunities for sharing can occur at a Grantee offsite, and shared during community events such as Ethereum conferences.
31. Variable scopes and durations:
In addition to the creation of multiple grants organizations with different scopes, grant programs should also be given different predetermined durations of time before coming up for renewal. Historically, the effectiveness of grant programs can be difficult to evaluate, so it is important that grant programs are given sufficient time to show impactful. Grant committees with smaller scopes can be renewed at shorter intervals based on their mandate, while committees with much larger, more fundamental mandates, should similarly have larger timescale to demonstrate their effectiveness. In the early times of an organization, the Grants committee should be expected to spend a larger amount of time and resources understanding how to operate, while successive committees should be expected to learn and incorporate previous learnings and thus be more effective, sooner.
32. Continuously evolve and improve:
Grant programs should be committed to continuous improvement and learning, adapting their strategies and approaches based on feedback, evaluations, and changing circumstances. This commitment to growth can help ensure the long-term success and impact of the grant program. It is important that evolution should be baked into the assumption of the creation of grant programs, the failure of a grant program should be interpreted as a learning for the community and rather than devolving into debate and recriminations, the community should take learnings and move forward with a new experiment. Grants programs should be viewed as opportunities to innovate on technology, explore applications and grow a healthy vibrant and diverse community.
In conclusion, effectively executing grant programs is crucial to the success of various projects, particularly in decentralized ecosystems. By addressing the challenges and implementing solutions to improve grant programs, parent organizations can foster innovation, cultivate a vibrant community, and drive the development of impactful projects. Continuous improvement, adaptability, and a commitment to collaboration will help grant programs remain relevant and effective in supporting the growth and success of the entire ecosystem.

13597,cryptomickbit,2023-04-08 19:54:52,"ARB has a quite a significant inflation, and fees based in ETH – aside from governance power, we should incentivize speculative investors by generating protocol revenue back to holders. Some potential options here are as follows;


Option #1
Timelock ARB for staking rewards – similar to Curve, people would timelock their ARB to acquire voting power relative to the duration. This can be the form of staking that part of the emissions would then distribute exclusively to those that timelock and stake. This not only increases scarcity, but brings a yield benefit to those that commit to greater lock times (skin in game theory)




Option #2
Similar to ETH, introduce a burn % of TX fee. Pretty strait forward – the greater the protocol activity, the more deflation.




Option #3
Change the unit of tx fee to ARB instead of ETH – Matic does this, Solana does this; its important to use the native token as that generates revenue and makes the token more valuable within the ecosystem.


From a speculative investment perspective, what is the value proposition to holding ARB? If ‘voting rights’ is all there is on offer, it will be difficult to sustain on-going investment. Voting rights is great, but that doesn’t really appeal to the larger audience in crypto if that is all there is to the token.
Would like to hear communities feedback.",1
13597,ameeradmi,2023-04-11 21:01:05,"I think you’ve answered the core issue yourself in the last paragraph. This is a governance token, and that’s it. It’s not made to be traded or price-speculated on. It has no intrinsic value, so I don’t think anyone should look at it as an “investment”.
However, if you still end up speculating on its value just for the fun of it, I’d highly recommend delegating your tokens’ voting rights to one of the delegates who can participate in governance on your behalf.",2
13597,cryptomickbit,2023-04-12 07:24:29,"I have to disagree with that – since there is no timelock criteria and governance is token weighted, if you do not introduce something like the ve-token model then you’re vulnerable to vote-buying exploit through escrow. That is a well-known issue with DAO’s and governance models which only a few have adapted to prevent.
I understand delegation already – I’m a delegate and governance coordinator for another project, have been for a few years now.
To put in simply;
Option #1 would be preferrable here as this mitigates ‘vote-buying’ and reduces circulating supply. Price does need to be sustained sufficiently otherwise it can undermine governance. Large whales can concentrate supply and thus voting power to influence direction, and without a locking criteria they’re not exposed to the outcome of any proposal post-voting if they wish. This mean price can be manipulated through pulling liquidity and doing a mark down > accumulate cheaper to grant more voting power > dump after voting is done. In short, the DAO can be gamed by larger stake holders if you do not incentivize widespread distribution and timelock mechanisms.
If you’re not familiar with ve-token governance – it basically means you would take your ARB and timelock it for a fixed duration; the longer you lock for equates to the more voting power you gain, which decays over time closer to lock expiry. This ensures that those larger holders participating in governance voting, are also exposed to the outcome and result of the proposal - ergo “skin in the game”. If you don’t do something like this, then the whole governance model can be easily undermined by vote-buying through escrow – that is, anyone from outside the community can temporarily have significant impact on voting without exposure to the outcome/result. Which means the door is wide-open for malicious governance attacks and exploitative proposals – yes, can use a veto council but that is not a decentralized process to solely depend on.",3
13597,Damboy,2023-05-15 11:01:55,"Providing additional incentives for holding ARB beyond governance power is a smart move @cryptomickbit . By implementing features such as timelocking ARB for staking rewards or introducing a burn percentage of transaction fees, we can create more value for ARB holders. These measures not only increase scarcity and generate deflation but also align the token’s utility with the protocol’s native ecosystem.
While voting rights are important, relying solely on them may limit the token’s appeal to a broader audience. By exploring these proposed solutions and seeking community input, we can enhance the investment proposition of ARB and attract more speculative investors. It’s essential to strike a balance between governance power and tangible benefits that resonate with the crypto community’s interests.",4
13597,Saludiego201,2023-05-20 15:10:36,"Vesting I don’t think is a good idea, as it would somewhat cause token inflation, unless you redirect the sequencer gains + that burn you propose.
Otherwise using ARB as a form of gas could be useful, but I see it better in chains that are mounted on top of Arbitrum, it could be more useful and generate more efficient use cases in my opinion.",5

Grants Framework Design Contest is LIVE!

What is it
A “Jokerace” contest designed to solicit bottoms-up input into a grants framework design process. During the submission period, people submit ideas on what a great grants framework might look like. Then during the voting period, the top 100 delegates will vote on which ideas they like the best. This will function as a “heatmapping” to showcase what ideas the DAO is most interested in seeing come to light.

Prizes
Top 3 submissions by votes will win:
1st place - 500 arb
2nd place - 200 arb
3rd place - 50 arb
Another 250 arb will be rewarded by the contest host at his discretion. (Yes that is me)

How to participate
Click on the  Jokerace Contest Page Link

Submission Period (4/20 - 5/13)
During the submission period, anyone can submit a grant framework design. Those familiar with “Design Thinking” will recognize this as a DAO native version of the double diamond design framework where we are currently in the second diamond diverging to brainstorm every possible solution idea.
Please do not submit proposals for funding individual projects.

Voting Period
During the voting period, top 100 delegates will vote to heatmap the most interesting frameworks. This is a convergence stage where we now heatmap for the best ideas.

Tips for a great submission
Things you might want to include:

how the mechanism sets a total spending limit
distinguishing between low and high latency work (ie. discord support help vs algorithm research)
tools needed to make it work
how the design is “pluralistic” or could it be one part of a larger plurastic framework
how it maintains accountability
how it increases voter participation and decreases apathy
how it provides the arbitrum a healthy future (sustainability)

Statement about purpose
This is not being put forward by the foundation, nor is it Offchain Labs. As a delegate in the Arbitrum ecosystem, I am helping to move things forward by showcasing innovative ways for the DAO to come to good decisions, avoid voter apathy over time, and sustain innovation and fun!

Design thinking for DAOs
Our next steps in the design process will be to have a small group of people engaged with the conversation gather to workshop the best proposal using the inputs from this experiment.

14026,Izkillaz,2023-04-22 06:38:57,"Great idea!
A Great Grants Framework Design should have the ff:

Total Spending Limit should be determined by the total ARB commited for the period divided by the number of stakers who committed for the said period or proposal.
A good identifier for low and high latency work would be ideal - some stickers or emojis would do  -  a chain icon (yes) , a broken heart (no)
Making it simpler , the better and would only make use of the available resources and updates will just be added as it progresses from time to time.
Majority rules is the key in making a pluralistic framework.
For accountability , we need to further stress on the value of reporting , sorting out real and valid reports only. Hard evidences like tx id and other pertinent information will always be necessary and should come from the ARB Ecosystem and if there are intstances in question of any loyalty as such should always be in favor of the Arbitrum Community.
For voter participation, we can have weekly or monthly summary with top 10 - 20 of these proposals and this is subject for a governance voting. We will adopt what is likely what the community would like to participate in.
All of these should be in parallel with Arbitrum’s ideals , vision and mission to achieve sustainability and progress!

 MattOnChain:

Do you think that a grants program should receive its allocation from the DAO’s ARB or the Foundation’s? If the Foundation: Should they take lead on setting up the program?


My opinion is that the DAO should run its own grants program separate from what the foundation does. We should give the foundation freedom to run a grants program of its own.
Perhaps the foundation should step in to help drive ideas forward, but the DAO needs to own its own processes or else voter apathy will happen. The best thing the DAO can do is create a grants framework that is so engaging, even to small holders, that people are buying ARB to participate in governing the DAO grants program.



 MattOnChain:

Would you rather see an established grants program run the show (a la Reverie / Questbook) or a custom solution specifically tailored for Arbitrum?


I’d rather see a plurality of mechanisms as discussed here: Grants Funding Framework Discussion - How To Excel at Being a DAO



 MattOnChain:

What should the grants programs main prerogative be?


I’ve been thinking about this lately. A north star could be total active developers in the Arbitrum ecosystem as defined by the Electric Capital Developer Report. However, this would need a counter metric to ensure we aren’t sacrificing quality. Therefore, we could score the GitHub of the projects and find a quality metric to maintain.",10
14026,MattOnChain,2023-04-26 18:13:02,"My initial reaction is that I am against the idea of allocating DAO resources toward a plethora of grants programs. Most of the grants programs we have seen thus far in other DAOs waste a ton of money and don’t end up benefiting the ecosystem or reducing voter apathy much (to a worthwhile extent.)
That said, I truly believe in grants programs. In an ideal world, we would have multiple trustworthy and well thought outs program submissions and I would be all for your strategy. I just don’t think this is the reality of it. Additionally, a lack of communication between programs could result in projects receiving funds multiple times. If we create a multitude of grants programs - I would highly suggest that each one specializes in a certain area similar to ENS (working groups) or Aave (AGD, Lens)
If our main goal with these programs is decreasing voter apathy, I would highly suggest looking toward MakerDAO, that has a substantially higher percentage of the circ supply regularly vote. Grants programs seem to bring developers more than increased participation.",11
14026,Oxytocin,2023-04-28 14:58:54,"Thanks a lot for taking the initiative to kickstart the grants programme in such a nice manner @DisruptionJoe . A grants programme is pretty much inevitable for a DAO like Arbitrum, which is not dApp specific like many other DAOs, but rather works a level above that.
However, to echo what @MattOnChain has said above, we shouldn’t just do a grants programme for the sake of it. What kind of projects do we want to incentivise? Are these grants to incentivise ecosystem growth through dApp incentives? Are they to develop the DAO toolbox itself? Or are we taking a completely different direction?
Personally, I will share some of my ideas on my submission, and I look forward to seeing the discussions of the result after mid may ",12

I think at the very high level stage of this framework design phase, it’s probably not too important to figure out what types of projects to incentivize but rather setting up systems to ensure there are incentives and the checks and balances are in place.",14
14026,Boiler,2023-05-16 18:10:02,"I think it would be great to get everyone’s submissions posted in the forums as well and hopefully open up some discussion around them and perhaps some of the submitters can shill their submissions a bit. I imagine the final grant org will be some kind of combination of various ideas. The more these ideas are discussed the better the solution will be.
The submission I was part of was from the DAO Masons called Grant Ships
You can read a more details about the proposal here
Our idea is to gamify Grant operations in order to continually improve upon the process while not being tied down to any single “process.” Our proposal allows for many processes to exist as “Grant Ships” There is a small competition occurring throughout the game which incentivizes Grant Ships to provide quality services. Poor performing ships would have funding slashed and could result in a new crew taking charge of a Ship.
We hope you enjoy our proposal and look forward to answering any questions or concerns you may have.",15

14272,tnorm,2023-05-02 15:14:39,"Introduction
Messari’s mission is to bring transparency to the crypto-economy. As such, we have developed many existing solutions for transparency and are constantly discussing new ones. As DAOs continue to adopt legal wrappers to conduct their operations, Messari has observed that many token-holders and investors feel these entities should uphold greater financial and operational transparency standards for the DAOs they serve. In an unregulated world, transparency is paramount.
Per the Arbitrum constitution, the Arbitrum DAO is responsible for governing the Arbitrum Foundation. As such, many stakeholders feel that the Foundation is obliged to provide transparency and accountability to its stakeholders. We were excited to see the community ratify the establishment of the Foundation in AIP 1.1 and applaud the expansive transparency provided by the Arbitrum Foundation. We also heard some community concerns regarding transparency standards and the initial transparency report.
Arbitrum has the unique opportunity to set industry standards for transparency and reporting in DAO-governed Foundations. This forum post aims to initiate this discussion. We invite any community member, delegates, and the Foundation to express their interest in finding a collaborative solution. We are happy to coordinate among parties and provide regular updates here over the next few weeks. This exercise is meant to allow the Foundation to communicate its continued alignment to serve the Arbitrum community while respecting its sovereignty as an independent entity.
Below are some general observations, considerations, and recommendations on where the DAO might start. These are directional ideas that we expect to change as we canvas the community and the Foundation to find an optimal transparency solution:
Exploring Foundation Transparency Standards
AIP 1.1 commits the Foundation to publish semi-annual progress reports and a comprehensive annual report. The reports aim to achieve the following objectives:



Proposal: AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency

better understanding of the Foundation’s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.





Proposal: AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency

provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation’s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.





Proposal: AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency

a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.


Operational Disclosures
The Foundation kindly offered to provide insight into operational expenditures. It is important for the DAO and the Foundation to be aligned on the expected deliverables. Some suggestions:


Governance and Decision-making:


Composition and structure of the Foundation’s internal committees, and management and disclosure of the Foundation’s organizational structure. This could include the number of employees, roles, and responsibilities.


Conflict of interest policies and procedures that ensure transparency and fairness and hold violators accountable.




Strategy and Objectives:


The Foundation’s mission, vision, strategic priorities, and progress towards achieving them.


Key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the Foundation’s success and the outcomes of its initiatives (see Uniswap Foundation).




Statement of Functional Expenses:


Classification of expenses by function (e.g., infrastructure spending, events, community building, etc.). The goal here is to help the community understand how resources are being allocated to achieve strategic goals. Nonprofits and NGOs often provide similar disclosures.


An overview of projects, initiatives, and grants supported by the Foundation, including their objectives, budgets, timelines, and status.


Outcomes and assessments for completed projects, initiatives, and grants (see LEGO Quarterly Reporting and Transaction Disclosure, Osmosis Grants Reporting).


The criteria and process for grant evaluation and awards.




Financial Disclosures
The Foundation has committed to providing insight into its financials. Establishing explicit deliverables between the DAO and Foundation might help set expectations for the annual report.
For example, an annual disclosure could include:


Balance Sheet.


Income Statement.


Cash Flow Statements.


Final Considerations and Concerns
Ultimately, the DAO should respect the Foundation’s autonomy, and the Foundation should respect the DAO’s need for transparency, especially considering the controversies surrounding AIP 1.
Open-Source Standards: The DAO could start by observing the disclosures of Foundations that support similar open-source software projects (Python Software Foundation, Ethereum Foundation). While Foundations encompass many legal entities and varying standards, they represent similar objectives. Both the Foundation and the DAO may find that reviewing existing precedents inform the standards that these annual reports adopt.
Return on Financial Investment: The costs and resources associated with implementing and maintaining reporting, especially for a new organization like the Arbitrum Foundation, could be considerable. We’d argue that the return on these types of reporting is invaluable to the DAO and community. If the Foundation has significant reservations, one alternative could be to initially adopt a simplified financial reporting framework and transition to full compliance as the Foundation matures.
Operational Disclosures: The DAO understands that a reluctance from the Foundation’s perspective might be the disclosure of strategic and organizational data. We believe these types of reports can be generated while acknowledging potential sensitivities.
Third-Party Audits: Should discrepancies arise, the DAO could request the right to implement a third-party audit, it also may be the Foundation’s preferred route to engage external auditors to perform annual audits proactively, irrespective of any perceived negligence.
Cadence: Some community members expressed that a quarterly disclosure cadence would be more appropriate than an annual/semi-annual cadence. A compromise could be detailed financial disclosures annually and quarterly Function Expense disclosures.
Budget Forecasting: Many DAO Foundations have provided transparency around their financial expenses and forecasted expenditures (Balancer Foundation, Uniswap Foundation).
Next Steps

Facilitate healthy community discourse around transparency standards.
Collect and summarize feedback from the community, delegates, and the Arbitrum Foundation.
Collaborate with the Arbitrum Foundation and stakeholders of the Arbitrum DAO to articulate clear guidelines and deliverables and establish formal transparency standards.

14272,Matt_StableLab,2023-05-02 18:58:11,"Thanks for starting this discussion @tnorm! This is essential to ensure a positive relationship is maintained between the DAO and Foundation. The following are some aspects of a transparency report we think would be beneficial for the DAO.
Composition of the Foundation - It is important for the DAO to understand who is working for the foundation and what they are doing. This helps add another layer of accountability and ensures the community knows who to ask if there are any questions.
Financial Disclosures - Financial reporting is necessary information for the DAO to ensure there is no frivolous spending in the foundation. This will also prove necessary if the foundation eventually asks for more funding from the DAO. The DAO will also need to perform this same reporting for its own spending to ensure the DAO is also managing its funding correctly.
Strategy and Objectives - The foundation by nature will have a slightly different mission and priorities than the DAO. However, the foundation’s general direction should be determined by the DAO sentiment. It is important to ensure both parties are moving towards common goals and prevent the two entities from performing conflicting actions.
Third-Party Audits - These are always important for full transparency. While it would be great to trust every report this can not always be the case and should questions arrive it is important to have a method of proving the validity of the report. This will require more thought on how exactly this process will work. It is vital these audits are done fairly and efficiently as poorly done could lead to even more confusion and a false sense of security in the DAO. A possible solution could be a committee within the DAO that verifies the reports before they are finalized.
KPIs - It would be beneficial for the DAO to come up with some KPIs we would like the foundation to meet. This will help the foundation better understand what the DAO wants and also help the DAO keep the foundation accountable.
We at StableLab are pleased to see discussions such as these focused on increasing transparency and accountability for all involved stakeholders.",2
12372,bubli.eth,2023-03-28 07:28:26,"I have been lurking in the Arbitrum governance forum and reading through various proposals and discussions. Being a token holder and keenly interested learning about governance model, I have been following the updates on how the newly formed ARB DAO is looking at handling governance and keeping it transparent, diverse, engaging and committed.
I always believed the DAO to be:

Collaborative
Transparent
Respectful
Decentralized as much as it can
Community and Stakeholder focused

I would like to see more active discussion and newer ways of cutting-edge governance proposal.
Will keep an eye to share my thoughts and experience.

12372,DisruptionJoe,2023-03-28 16:18:50,"I’d love to see this. I’m a big fan of Quadratic Weighted Staking.
To utilize governance tokens, $ARB holders would have to stake their $ARB to “charge up” (yes, like turbo in NBA Jam!). Let’s say that staking for 3 months gives your 80% of your governance weight. 1 year would give you 90%. A logarithmic curve.
Flexible Voting would allow people to LP and earn yeild while staking for governance.
It is called “Quadratic” because the voting power is the square root of $ARB tokens held times the “charge up” coefficient. This makes the preferences of many more important than the few.
Additionally, by forcing staking commitments to vote, it creates a natural sybil resistance because bad actors are forced to play into positive sum game theory.
I’d love to propose this to governance sooner than later.",2

11959,CryptoNick,2023-03-25 14:48:01,"Hello everyone,
I would like to suggest the removal of the “Trending Delegates” selection from the Arbitrum DAO site. While this feature may seem useful for identifying popular and successful delegates, it can actually lead to centralization of power by suggesting to delegate to only a select few individuals.
Delegating to a diverse range of delegates is important for maintaining a decentralized network that is not controlled by a single entity. By promoting only the trending delegates, we are essentially telling users to delegate to the same set of people, thereby limiting the diversity and potentially leading to a concentration of power in the hands of a few.
Edit:
Instead of relying on a small group of trending delegates, we should encourage users to explore different delegates. It could be based on performance (not an option as-of-now) or region or just have delegates write a small post which would be displayed on the website. This will not only help users make a more informed decision about who to delegate to, but also promote healthy competition among delegates.",1
11959,yonathan,2023-03-25 16:57:51,"The Trending Delegates section updates every time you refresh the page.
I believe it’s normal for a couple of Delegates to have a bigger delegation, since they’re known entities/DAOs and/or individuals, which generates trust.
I like the section because it incentivises people to delegate and to explore the different delegators, but I do still agree with you, that we should find a way to spread the delegation in the near future.",2

 yonathan:

Seems to undermine the trustless nature of blockchain.",3
11959,yonathan,2023-03-25 17:58:07,"I don’t believe that. Everyone can choose not to delegate. By delegating you’re trusting your voting power on a Delegate and can always choose to keep that VP with them or for yourself, there’s no on-chain activity going on, so doesn’t really affect the nature of the blockchain imo",4
11959,Kramnatius.eth,2023-03-25 18:37:49,"Yes delegation is a choice, but concentrating voting power in a few Delegates contradicts blockchains decentralization principles.
Focusing on trending delegates can centralize power, making the network less secure.",5
11959,yonathan,2023-03-25 18:47:18,"What do you mean by “focusing on trending delegates”? As I said before, the section changes each time you refresh the page, so the ones you see now are not exactly the ones somebody else is seeing. Some might come up more often because well, they are trending.
And I think everyone agrees that the VP should be delegated amongst several delegates and not a few. It’s still early days though, and only around 11% of the tokens are in circulation atm.",6
11959,CryptoNick,2023-03-25 19:16:05,"The fact that the “Trending Delegates” section updates every time the page is refreshed does not address the concern about centralization of power. If the same few delegates continue to appear in the trending section, then users may still be incentivized to delegate to them, which could lead to a concentration of power in the hands of a few.
I just tried refreshing my page 10 times and out of 10 times, the results were:

TreasureDAO was shown 6 times
Litocoen was shown 5 times
Olimio.eth was shown 4 times
Bignoodle.eth was shown 4 times
404 DAO was shown 2 times.

This raises the concern that the trending delegates section may not be promoting diversity and decentralization, but instead may be leading to a concentration of power in the hands of a few select delegates.
While it is true that some delegates may have a larger delegation due to being known entities or individuals, this does not necessarily mean that they are the best choice for every user. By promoting only the trending delegates, we are limiting the diversity of options available to users and potentially discouraging them from exploring other options.
While it is important to incentivize people to delegate and explore different delegators, this should not be done at the expense of promoting a diverse and decentralized network. Encouraging healthy competition among delegates can still be done without relying solely on the trending delegates section.
This was almost the same setup as Sample Voting Issue 1: with flipside and uniswap.
edit:
This raises the concern If users consistently choose to delegate to a trending delegate, it could reinforce their position as a trending delegate and lead to a never-ending cycle of trending. This could create a situation where a small group of delegates have a disproportionate amount of power within the network.Which would lead to a situation where only a few large delegates have a significant amount of power and influence in the network, while smaller delegates are marginalized and unable to make a meaningful impact.",7
11959,Castun,2023-03-26 23:09:21,"Personally I agree with either getting rid of the trending section or altering the way that it works to make it more so fair, for example: Delegates could become trending based on activity within the forum instead of just activity related to people delegating tokens to them.

On 25th, March in the Arbitrum Discord dev-announcements channel, a robot with an admin’s name dropped a link to fake arbitrum foundation website. Some of people entered that site where they could connect wallets. Once anyone connected his wallet, his Arbitrum tokens, USDC and other tokens would be transfered to a hacker’s wallet. Many people lost all of their $ARB, USDC and other tokens by clicking to the link.
Reason to propose:
The scam link appeared in Official Arbitrum Discord dev-announcements channel, which caused people believe in the link and clicked into it. The victims shouldn’t bear the loss by themselves.
