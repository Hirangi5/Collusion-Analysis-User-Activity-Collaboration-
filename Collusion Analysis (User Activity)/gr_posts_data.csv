How to submit a DAO Proposal

1. Discourse
https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/ is a forum for governance related discussions.
Community members must register for an account before sharing or liking posts.
The Proposal is suggested on the discourse and discussed for 1 week.
To create a Proposal:
Navigate to the Proposals Category and create a new topic.
The proposal should have the following format:


Title – Proposal: [Insert Description]

Constitutional / Non-Constitutional - For clarity, please refer to section 2 of the Constitution


Abstract - Two or three sentences that summarize the AIP.

Motivation - A statement on why the Arbitrum community should implement the AIP.

Rationale - An explanation of how the AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission and guiding values.

Key Terms (optional) - Definitions of any terms within the proposal that are unique to the proposal, new to the Arbitrum community, and/or industry-specific.

Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.

Steps to Implement - The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.

Timeline - Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.

Overall Cost - The total cost to implement the AIP

Additional fields can be added to any template if necessary to fully communicate the intentions, specifics, and implications.
If an AIP did not pass, resubmitted AIPs should also include:

A link to the original AIP;
Reason the original AIP was not approved;
Changes that have been made and why it should now be approved


2. Snapshot
Snapshot is an off-chain voting interface that allows the community to signal sentiment (i.e. temperature check) on the proposed AIP. The vote will be open for 1 week.
To create a snapshot vote:

Navigate to Snapshot to create a poll
Connect your wallet.
Create a poll that points to your forum post.
The poll should run for one week and should be decided by a simple majority.
Navigate back to your forum post and share the link to your Snapshot poll with the community.


3. Tally:
Tally | Arbitrum serves as the on-chain voting platform for the ArbitrumDAO to submit and vote on AIPs and serves as a front-end user interface that allows DAO members to do several things, namely:

Create AIPs;
View delegates and their voting share;
Re-delegate votes to a different delegate;
View current and past AIPs;
Vote on AIPs on-chain, interacting with the on-chain governance contracts via the Tally front-end; and
View the status of AIP execution during all voting stages
