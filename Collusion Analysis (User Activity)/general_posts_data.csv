20722,Arbitrum,2024-01-18 19:37:26,"TL;DR:  In collaboration with Offchain Labs, the Arbitrum Foundation is excited to announce the new Arbitrum Expansion Program and Arbitrum Developer Guild.
Teams interested in launching Arbitrum technology chains now have an easier, self-service path for launching custom Arbitrum Orbit Chains by joining the Expansion Program. It allows any project to deploy their own customized version of the Arbitrum technology stack. L3s that settle to Arbitrum One and Nova already are and remain free and permissionless to use and customize. Today’s announcement makes it easier than ever to launch custom Arbitrum L2s that settle directly to Ethereum as well as Arbitrum L3s on top of other non-Arbitrum chains.
There are only two key requirements for participation in the Arbitrum Expansion Program, aimed at ensuring alignment with both Ethereum and the Arbitrum DAO. First, participants are expected to contribute a portion of their profits back to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Second, the deployment of the rollup must be exclusive to Ethereum or any chain that derives its security from Ethereum.
Via the permissionless revenue sharing model of the Program, Orbit chains are free to customize L2s or L3s that settle to Ethereum, including on top of non-Arbitrum chains!  L3s that settle to Arbitrum One and Nova are still covered by the existing free, permissionless path.

The Program provides support for teams looking to highly customize their chain configuration, including dedicated blockchain space, custom gas token, native account abstraction, alternative data availability layer choices, and potential future services from the Arbitrum community. Aside from the built-in customization options, Orbit developers are free to customize the code in any way they see fit.
A differentiating feature of Arbitrum Orbit is that the chains retain full control of their governance  and will not be required to outsource their governance or share governance with other chains and ecosystems. Teams building with Orbit have freedom to customize and innovate however they see fit.
While L3s that settle to Arbitrum One or Nova will not be required to share revenue with the Arbitrum DAO, L2s as well as L3s on top of other chains will have to share a portion of their revenue. Part of the contributed revenue will go to a newly established Arbitrum Developer Guild, a new initiative to help fund core Arbitrum development and attract the best development teams to contribute to the Arbitrum tech stack.
L2s and L3s with infinite possibilities – customize Orbit to your needs!
The demand for rollups as a foundational technology stack is rapidly increasing. Projects are eager to modify the Arbitrum stack according to their business needs and run their own instance of the Orbit software. The Orbit deployment tool comes built-in with a host of customization options, and developers can go even deeper than that and use the codebase to make deep customizations…
Not every project needs their own chain, and indeed for many applications, launching on Arbitrum One or Nova is the ideal choice. But there are several compelling reasons that make a custom chain a great choice for many projects, and Arbitrum Orbit is a flexible solution that can meet the needs of any project looking to build their own chain in the Ethereum ecosystem:

Dedicated blockspace. Gain independence from chain usage by other applications
Custom gas token. Choose which token is used for chain fees allowing you to create native economies and utility incentives
Native account abstraction. Go beyond Ethereum’s account abstraction
Alternative data availability layer choices. AnyTrust, Celestia, and more data availability solutions are already integrated into Arbiturm Orbit
No governance constraints. Control your own destiny; no need to submit to shared governance

Arbitrum Orbit has already been adopted by dozens of teams, but with the introduction of the Expansion Program, all of Orbit’s capabilities are now easily accessible to teams wanting to make a custom L2 that settles directly to Ethereum, or even build an L3 on top of a non-Arbitrum chain that settles to Ethereum. Teams wishing to create an L3 that settles to Arbitrum One are still covered by the existing, free, permissionless model.
We are actively researching and developing best in class interoperability solutions for Orbit chains, and we expect to see many live Orbit chains that can easily interact for one unified Ethereum experience.
Why was the Arbitrum Expansion Program created? What are the benefits and requirements?
Prior to the Expansion Program, developers that were interested in deploying their own Arbitrum technology chain could choose one of three paths: (1) build their chain as an  L3 that settles to Arbitrum One or Nova, which was and remains  a permissionless activity  (2) If they wanted to build an L2 then they could  ask the Arbitrum DAO to issue  a software license using the Arbitrum DAO’s governance system or (3) negotiate terms with the Arbitrum Foundation (Offchain Labs also maintains the right to issue licenses but has preferred to allow the community to steer this process to date).  While the process worked well for those looking to build L3s, the latter options were cumbersome and high-touch for those looking to build L2s. With the growing demand for Arbitrum Orbit chains of all types, it became clear that the community needed an efficient process for launching chains that also aligns with Etherem and the Arbitrum DAO.
The Arbitrum Expansion Program streamlines this via a self-service model that fosters incentive alignment amongst all parties including contributors, community members, ecosystem projects and the newly deployed rollups. It focuses on:

Permissionless adoption. Anyone can adopt the technology stack and modify it according to their project’s requirements.
Ethereum alignment. All deployments must ultimately settle on top of Ethereum or a chain whose integrity is secured by Ethereum.
Value accrual. Automatically contributes a portion of the chain’s revenue back to the Arbitrum DAO and to a new Arbitrum Developer Guild fund for contributors to the Arbitrum codebase.
Community enablement. Additional community-run features, alongside the software license, that will act as a supportive cornerstone for projects that adopt the Arbitrum technology stack.
Freedom to innovate. There is no limitation on how a chain governs itself such as a requirement to submit to shared governance or other similar constraining structures.

First and foremost, the Expansion Program includes a software license that allows anyone to freely modify the code with changes required for their project. Possible customizations include choosing which data availability layer to use, the ability to experiment with sequencer environments and MEV frameworks,  integrating entirely new virtual machines (like Arbitrum Stylus), and so much more!.
All Orbit deployments must rely on Ethereum for settlement and adhere to the Arbitrum Constitution’s community value of being Ethereum aligned. This requires that the deployment has its security depend on the Ethereum blockchain, and by way of example, intends to include optimistic rollups, zk-rollups, optimiums and validiums that settle to Ethereum.The motivation is to strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem by making Arbitrum’s best-in-class technology available to any team that wants to launch an L2 or L3 in the Ethereum ecosystem.
The Arbitrum technology stack will be implemented, and should be configured to, automatically share a portion of the chain revenue back. This feature is not currently live in production, but is being worked on, and we hope to release it shortly. All users of the Arbitrum Expansion Program will pay the same percentage, which is computed only on the chain’s sequencer profit (inclusive of its MEV strategies). The initial percentage is set at 10% (which will be received by a wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation), and once compliance checks have been completed, subsequently rerouted with 8% being distributed to the ArbitrumDAO and the remaining 2% to a special developer fund, the Arbitrum Developer Guild, for contributors to the codebase.
What is the mission of the Arbitrum Developer Guild?
The Guild is being created to incentivize and grow the set of  core developers building the Arbitrum technology.  Only once  the Guild membership has expanded will the funds be appropriately distributed amongst its members. We will be sharing more information about and how to get involved in the Arbitrum Developer Guild in the near future, and interested teams are encouraged to reach out.
What’s the future vision for the Arbitrum Expansion Program?
Arbitrum Orbit chains will benefit from the already announced upcoming technical upgrades such as Stylus and Bold. We further anticipate that the Expansion Program can be extended over time to include additional opt-in benefits which may include new technical features like automatic smart contract upgrades and a global pause feature by Arbitrum’s security council, as well as non-technical benefits such as eligibility to participate in other programs run by the ArbitrumDAO. The Expansion Program should be viewed as an evolving package of features that will be made available for projects adopting the Arbitrum technology stack giving them access to a broad range of technical features and ecosystem initiatives.
If the Expansion Program is successful, this approach can provide a new project seeking to use the Arbitrum technology stack the best of both worlds: independence to tailor the software to meet specific business needs while benefiting from extensive support from the Arbitrum community.

From the listed tokens growth in price
Lender interest
Rewards from the program.

This post explores why depositing funds on Fringe Finance can be lucrative for these token holders, drawing insights from the platform’s incentive program and the new features introduced in V2.
The list of tokens available on ARBITRUM is as follows: PENDLE, LDO, GNS, WBTC, RDNT, GRAIL, MATIC, wstETH, WETH, ARB, LUSD, FXS, SUSHI, DAI, KNC, LINK, UNI, GMX, USDT, and USDC.e
V2 Features: Expanding Opportunities for Token Holders
The launch of Fringe Finance V2 introduces several key features that enhance the capital efficiency of all tokens available on our platform:
Margin Trade and Amplify: Beyond traditional lending and borrowing, V2 offers leveraged trading facilities, allowing users to amplify their exposure to supported crypto assets. This means these token holders can leverage their holdings to engage in strategic trades and potentially increase their returns.
Revolutionary Interest Rate Model: The new interest rate model dynamically adjusts rates to maintain optimal utilization, maximising lender revenue and minimising borrower costs. This model benefits token holders by potentially offering higher yields on their deposits.
Repay Using Collateral: V2 allows users to repay loans and margin trade positions using the position’s collateral. This feature provides flexibility for token holders, enabling them to manage their investments more efficiently.
Expanded Asset Availability: Fringe Finance V2 supports a wide range of assets. This broad asset support, combined with features like multi-asset lending and integration of advanced price feeds, opens up new avenues for these token holders to diversify their DeFi activities and enhance their earning potential.
Incentive Program: A Catalyst for Lender Profits
1600×900 119 KB
This program directly rewards lenders for their deposits, creating a cycle that benefits all participants in the ecosystem.
The incentive program is structured around five lender Total Value Locked (TVL) milestones, with rewards issued as each target is met and sustained.
The rewards, issued in FRIN tokens, are calculated based on the proportion of interest earned by a lender’s deposits relative to the total interest earned on the platform. This approach ensures that the more capital a lender contributes and the longer they participate, the greater their potential rewards.

21480,Boban,2024-02-26 19:36:45,"Hello,
Might be time to discuss :
“Arbitrum made $72.8m in revenue over the past 365d. However, $53.2m of that accrued to $ETH holders instead of $ARB holders.”
Yes eth security blabla, I am focused into arb value accrual. And arbitrum is the home of defi.",1
21480,cp0x,2024-02-27 21:30:17,"Hi,
Owning the ARB, unfortunately, does not provide any advantages for the sequencer, but ETH staking gives.
If you are trying to refer to a similar offer from Uniswap, then the income there will go not to the owners of UNI, but to those who staked it.",2
21480,Boban,2024-02-27 21:59:48,"Hey,
Note that arb staking is coming so basiaclly I was speaking as an additional feature?",3
21480,cp0x,2024-02-29 16:13:20,"Why don’t you then write an official proposal here to discuss it with all participants?
It will be interesting",4
21480,LONG_TRADAO,2024-02-29 16:20:13,"Hello, this income is not accurate. As l2, arb must pay costs to l1. Therefore, if we really want to generate revenue for arb, we should deduct the cost and decentralize the sorter, allowing users to pledge arb to maintain the sorter. In this regard, arb is already developing testnets with several projects.",5
21480,Boban,2024-02-29 16:45:00,"Being a random anon in this DAO is costly. I have been trying to push a proposal, people weren’t interested and not much discussion happened.
I waste so much energy to make a proposal, and when you ask questions on arb or plutus discord you get banned.
So i don’t care anymore, lots of shady things happening right now",6
21451,Boban,2024-02-26 01:18:32,"Hello guys,
I’m an anon, arb citizen. It seems that in the recent weeks, the whole respect towards holders has been forgotten by most if not everyone.
I have been asking questions on Arbitrum discord and Plutus discord, concerning staking, sequencer fees sharing and so on.
Note that I have been muted for 1 week in both for asking questions. Some community managers don’t understand their job is to answer community members. Transparency is key.
Yet it seems random anons can’t get any respect. I expect nobody to answer this as always since I have 0 influence. But I know that right now I’m talking on the behalf of the majority.
Lots of questions unanswered, lots of shady disappearence and on top of that you get kicked for asking questions.
I’m wondering where is this going for genuine believers.
I have nothing to propose since the road of proposal for anons is nearly impossible.",1

I’m Alan, Co-Founder of Open Web Academy, we are an learning community focused on creating tools for the Open Web.
We consider Web 3 as the big partner to create a robust infrastructure for the Open Web, and so all scalability solutions are of our major interest.
We have a set of collaborations with Arbitrum that has been done, some funded, some others by our own interest:

We created the first component for liquid staking of Meta Pool running on Arbitrum One using NEAR’s Blockchain Operating System stack and Sushi Swap pools. This allows to have both: Smart contracts and frontend decentralized. Stake here:https://near.org/owa-is-bos.near/widget/SwapETH-mpETH
Due that we received funds from the 1inch + Arbitrum Gitcoin Round, we are creating the first 1inch BOS component for Arbitrum. You can learn how are we doing that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc_1rJzLRvc&list=PLkwvyg8hchrtNRrikYHSUD1n3c7MFnSuf
We launched our community token into arbitrum $OWA-alpha, the token to reward Open Web builders that is delivered in our bootcamps, hackathons and community calls.

More than that, we are here to learn and get involved with the Arbitrum Community! Great to know about more people building the Open Web using Arbitrum, and also if you are based on Latam we are too!
Thanks!",1

21275,Hesinburg,2024-02-16 10:05:37,"Abstract
We propose Arbitrium consider support Tor Wallet by their Grants program. TorWallet wishes to equip Grantors and Grantees with a robust set of tools to simplify, streamline, and increase transparency for participants in the grants process.
Tor Wallet is a first EVM compatible privacy focused wallet with built-in TOR. Earn TOR tokens on every transactions you made.
Problem Statement
When relying on conventional wallets, your IP address is transmitted to various third-party services. These services may also have visibility into multiple wallet addresses associated with you. This exposes you to potential tracking and surveillance, as well as the risk of transaction censorship. Tor Wallet, on the other hand, eliminates these concerns by integrating the Tor protocol, ensuring that your IP address and wallet-related information remain confidential and secure, protecting you from unwanted tracking and transaction censorship.
Solution
Tor Wallet goes beyond just preventing such privacy risks; it offers advanced features to enhance both privacy and security. By integrating the Tor protocol, Tor Wallet ensures that your IP address is shielded, preventing any potential tracking or surveillance associated with your wallet activities.
Moreover, Tor Wallet incorporates additional layers of privacy and security measures, providing users with a comprehensive solution that goes above and beyond traditional wallets. Experience a new level of confidence in your blockchain interactions with Tor Wallet’s robust privacy and security features.
Technical Framework
Torwallet is compatibility with EVM, and its compatible blockchains has greatly improvised our project, due to the added features of high decentralization, and scalability.

Circuit Management
We establish and manage a pool of dormant Tor circuits.

Upon necessity, we select a circuit at random and withdraw it from the pool.
We eliminate the need to wait for circuit creation by directly selecting one from the pool. Simultaneously, the pool seamlessly generates additional circuits in the background.

IP Address Collision
Typically, we make diligent efforts to ensure that the two sets of circuits do not overlap. However, it is important to note that there exists a low, albeit possible, probability that a wallet may utilize a TOR exit node that has been employed by another wallet in the past.
Evil RPC
While there is a chance that the two wallets share the same IP address, suggesting potential control by the same individual, absolute certainty is challenging due to the widespread reuse of IP addresses by numerous users.

Risks & challenges

The Tor network
Our commitment extends beyond just leveraging the Tor network; we plan to enhance its capabilities by introducing WebTor and persistently contributing to its development. Having already addressed security issues within Tor, we are dedicated to a future that not only safeguards privacy but also strengthens the Tor network for everyone.
Project side
Yet, our journey is far from concluded. Our ongoing commitment revolves around crafting an unparalleled user experience while upholding our principle of “zero-cost privacy.” This presents a substantial challenge, especially considering that many traditional wallets grapple with UX complexities without being encumbered by the same privacy and security constraints that define our wallet. Nevertheless, we’re determined to overcome these challenges and set new standards in user-friendly, private, and secure wallet experiences.

** Specifications**
We propose Arbitrium augment the existing grants program by integrating TorWallet for processing grant applications from members of the Arbitrium community.
TorWallet will be able to continue disbursal of grant funds via the Arbitrium ""Grant",1
21194,pedrob,2024-02-12 18:55:13,"The following is a post that brings a discussion to the forum that, given the current state of Arbitrum’s governance, I believe would be beneficial to have. It concerns the use of committees for resource management. This is just a general outline of the issue, and I would like to receive feedback from the delegates to know if there is interest in delving deeper into the matters presented here.
The article published by tokenbrice on their reasons for resigning from the GHO Liquidity Committee caused quite a stir. I encourage every participant of DAO governance to take time to read the article, since it raises many valid points that occur and are replicated across many of the most prominent DAOs.
Lately, Arbitrum DAO has opted for the formation of multiple committees to manage various aspects of resource allocation decisions and the creation of frameworks.
The establishment of such committees has been the response to avoid “centralization” of decision-making regarding resource allocation in the hands of a few or a single person. Whether this is the best approach is debatable, as is the advisability of centralizing certain types of decisions (an interesting discussion about this in Vitalik’s article on convex vs. concave decisions).
I don’t think it’s wrong for a DAO to experiment with appointing committees to sort things out. However, I’m Argentine, and in our country, a phrase from an old political leader is very popular, stating that “If you want something done, name someone responsible. If you want something to be delayed forever, appoint a commission,” (this phrase is originally attributed to Napoleon and before him to Joan of Arc). Obviously, this view stems from recognizing the efficiency of centralizing decision-making versus the inefficiency of delegating it.
In environments where avoiding centralization is sought, delegating decision-making to multiple parties seems desirable. However, forming committees without taking certain precautions can lead to an outcome as bad or worse than centralization: complete inaction. It can make the process non-transparent, decisions taken for unknown reasons, lack of accountability, or failure to meet objectives without understanding why.
Arbitrum has recently approved 4 committees (under different names):
Treasury Screening Committee
LTIPP Council & Advisors
ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee
Arbitrum Research & Development Collective
Note that I am not pointing out one or another committee in particular nor do I claim that this should affect its functioning. The experience collected in the aforementioned committees should help strengthen what can be a framework in the future.
If we can agree on certain guidelines or best practices for the operation of future designated committees (or even apply best practices to the mentioned ones), the shortcomings of “decentralizing” decision-making will be reduced, while we can create a framework for the future that is included in the upcoming proposals.
I’ll leave here some ideas to start with, hoping to receive everyone’s feedback.
Problem 1: Lack of clear tasks and objectives to measure outcomes
It is crucial to define the scope of work for the committee, as well as to clearly set out its objectives in order to later measure the results obtained. Just as a protocol requires metrics, KPIs, and milestones to be granted funding, a committee should be required to have clear and defined objectives with deadlines to achieve them.
Problem 2: Lack of external accountability
Committees should have a designated leader responsible for ensuring that milestones or deadlines are met. It often happens that when everyone is responsible, no one is responsible. If there is a concern about centralization, the leadership role can rotate. However, there should always be someone accountable for the status of the work and the adherence to deadlines.
Problem 3: Lack of internal accountability
The roles within the committee must be clearly defined. Each member should have clear objectives and deadlines. It’s important to avoid having a single, generic goal for the committee, which can cause some or many members to feel lost about how to act or coordinate.
Problem 4: Lack of transparency
Communication among committee members should be as open and transparent as possible. Decision-making should also be as open and transparent as possible. A Zoom, Google Meet call or telegram chat are neither open nor transparent, even if recordings or transcripts are shared later (which I doubt many will watch, to be honest).
As uncomfortable as it may be, an effort must be made to avoid repeating the mistakes of traditional politics and to overemphasize transparency and communication. There are tools available for holding meetings and avoiding spam, such as Discord (where open channels can be created for users to read/listen without interacting).
Someone can be designated to handle reporting or to summarize and communicate all meetings.
Communication should always be a top priority.
Problem 5: Lack of engagement with governance / community
Specific mechanisms for feedback from the broader community to the committees and vice versa could be further elaborated. This would enhance the iterative learning and improvement of the committee’s operations.
Problem 6: Are committees a popularity contest?
The effectiveness of a committee does not only depend on having clear objectives, accountability, and transparency but also on the competence and confidence of its members to carry out their tasks.
Is an open election the best way to choose committee members? How can we ensure that its members are those better skilled for the task? (this is an open question tbh).
What’s the best mechanism for assessing the skills and qualifications of potential committee members?
Is it possible to avoid popularity contests at all? One solution could be providing a budget for training committee members. Proper training can equip committee members with the necessary skills for informed decision-making. This could be a useful tool in this context, where committee members come from a wide range of backgrounds and may not have previous experience in similar roles.
Open questions that would love to get feedback on:
Conflicts are inevitable in any group decision-making process. Which is the best way to handle conflicts within committees?
How can we manage conflicts of interest between the candidates for a committee and at the same time ensure that it is made up of the best qualified people? Is there a way to minimize the risk of conflict of interest without harming Arbitrum? What is the balance?
Conclusion
This post is not intended to be a framework, but rather to be an RFC that seeks the engagement of the DAO to understand if it makes sense to create provisions of this type that delegates should expect or require when the formation of committees is proposed in AIPs.
I also plan to create a version 2 of this overview, incorporating examples from this and other DAOs to illustrate what has been effective and what hasn’t. This will help clarify which frameworks are most likely to succeed. It would be great if current committee members share their own opinions and insights on their roles.
I await your feedback on all the points raised here ",1
21194,JoJo,2024-02-14 17:25:43,"Interesting post.
I have found myself reflecting on this a bit. I think that every community/social entity, growing up, would go naturally through the following phases accordingly to the scale of numbers

initial set of founders/leaders, all with specific skillset, all deciding together
still founder/leaders, but then start involving more community members, especially the one actives or with skills
then, full out democracy on 1:1 based decisions with people being appointed by each others/leaders
finally, group of people being appointed for specific functions as the scale of work is too much to handle for a single guy.

Now, this doesn’t refer to any dao or our dao. But to any org. Is the less friction path. For which I don’t see necessarily anything wrong, as long as there is no stigma of a group taking a lead versus a single and viceversa.
On your questions:

Agree. Every committee/appointed person need tasks to be clear. Problem: the proposals, that go first on snapshot then on tally, have more often than not holes, and is sometimes impossible to establish a scope. Crafting the proposal in a more formal and robust way on the other hand would take a lot of time.
Would be good. Only doable if the leader has power on the rest of the committee. This, usually, translate in the ability to alt/change the compensation for example. Do we want to go down that route? Or, is there any alternative mechanism?
I think is the same problem of 2.
We can for sure getting better with reporting. But is not only the report: is also how is written, where is published and the language used. A standardization would help us a lot. Difficult to achieve in a corporate world, VERY difficult in a dao
this is a broader problem. Again, I agree, we need to use the forum more, and we need people to also write less (me included kek)
sometimes yes. The idea of training members is interesting tho, making people committed to the dao grow, inside the dao, would be something matching people in corporate being paid to study to bring after more knowledge and value.

On conflicts: the way crypto works, is quite impossible. Anybody can have affiliations to a lot of entities, either directly or indirectly. Full disclosure, and alternative in numbers when is time to recuse from a specific vote (so a pm can take the role for example) is key. But only using intellectual honesty will take us up to a certain point, and bad actors are always ready to exploit this. Yes, we need to think this through.

I have my own idea tho.
People who work for the dao (cause this is the term we need to start to use. If the dao compensate you to do something, you are working), should be threated most of the time like managers, not employee.
This means a compensation structured in a way that a base salary is there. But then, the bulk of it comes if results are effectively met. This poses the followings:

who evaluates that the results were met? (probably the dao)
how is the evaluation done? (probably through a vote)
what are these “results”? (probably tied to 1., re: clear tasks/goal)
is it ok, for a “manager” to be evaluated by people that might or might not have that same level of knowledge on the topic? (answer should be yes if i am in a dao, then again, if i realize a risk model that saves in the course of 2 years 5.6M dollars in costs, what instruments have effectively voters to evaluate this?)
how can we keep the mechanism above, without disincentivizing people to work for the dao? (there could be people who effectively need money upfront, or that might feel not up to the task. Answer could be: optionality of payment).

I know all of the above rotates around compensantion. This is not cause I am a greedy motherfucker*. But because, effectively, in the situation in which we are, with how easy mobility is for a single person through several DAOs compared to normal job, the only real way to align incentives and success is through the token itself which is an expression of the whole DAO.
*(well I probably am but that is not the point here)",2
21194,cp0x,2024-02-14 23:46:23,"Hello, @pedrob
I like the topic you brought up.

I agree with you about the clear goals of the committees, which I previously expressed to the authors of proposals to create these committees.
I also like the idea of appointing a responsible committee member who must present the results of the work of the entire committee (of course, with a large salary for this)
As for conflicts within the committee, perhaps it should be like in a jury trial - until everyone agrees with the decision, no decision should be made. And dissolve the committee (re-elect) if such conflicts do not allow this committee to work.
As for the qualifications of members, this is a difficult question, since for the most part there are no diplomas in the crypto space that confirm your qualifications and everything is based only on your experience and reputation.

21194,commons17119,2024-02-15 14:21:56,"Thank you for raising this topic. I would like to share my thoughts on some aspects of the issue.
It is essential for the community to understand the inherent corruptibility of the committee mechanism.
These phenomena are very familiar to the Chinese people. China’s governance mechanism is ostensibly a parliamentary system, but in reality, it is a one-party dictatorship committee system. The power of the entire country is decentralized to one committee after another.
It operates on the basis of compromise, an unspoken mechanism. Each member expects that his concession on one issue will be met with concessions from others on other issues - the space of internal opacity allows committee members to compromise with each other and compensate each other in the future, thus quickly finding common ground and promoting action.
The community has a false imagination about the source of the efficiency of the committee: experts form a committee, and based on logical and factual debate, form rational judgments to quickly advance the cause. However, this is a beautiful fantasy of intellectuals. In reality, the main reason why the committee mechanism is more efficient than the parliamentary system (proposal-voting) is because because experts can compromise with each other and reach a consensus more quickly. The efficiency of the committee mechanism relies on internal opacity and模糊全责. It is more suitable for political actors who are good at compromise and waiting, while researchers (such as Tokenbrice) always find it difficult to survive in committees. Questions 3, 4, and 5 are actually all derived characteristics of the committee mechanism.
In short, the committee mechanism is a trade-off of efficiency for governance with impurity and public corruption.",4
21194,thedevanshmehta,2024-02-15 18:58:01,"Thanks for kickstarting such an important discussion! As a creator of one of the aforementioned committees (treasury screening committee for STEP), here are some insights i’ve gained



 pedrob:

Problem 1: Lack of clear tasks and objectives to measure outcomes


This is perhaps the most important one - to recruit high quality committee members, we need bounded tasks without too much scope creep.
The way we recruited members was laying out 3 tasks they need to undertake: draft an RFP post snapshot vote and pre-tally vote; screen out applicants after submission window closes; draft/approve report cards on shortlisted applicants for delegates to read before the snapshot weighted vote determining exact allocation between them



 pedrob:

Problem 3: Lack of internal accountability


This is made much easier when committees have dissolution baked in from the start.
In general we need to differentiate between posts (regular elections to hold the role, like ARDC/procurement/ltipp council will become if deemed successful) and committees (timebound and dissolved after achieving a purpose, like our screening committee  which is dissolved after allocations are complete)



 pedrob:

Problem 4: Lack of transparency





 commons17119:

It is essential for the community to understand the inherent corruptibility of the committee mechanism.


The MOST important thing here is do not give committees direct power to award business. That is  and should remain the job of delegates and ARB token holders, as jojo puts it



 JoJo:

the only real way to align incentives and success is through the token itself which is an expression of the whole DAO.


For STEP, we found the tokenized tbill RWA space is quite small and there was an existing network of favors, relations, etc between players in the space. So rather than give power to one set of players (committee members) to award huge business contracts to another set of players that they may work for in the future or take other favors from, we circumscribed their role to a yes / no vote for consideration by the DAO and nonbinding opinions which delegates can read on each provider before voting



 pedrob:

Problem 2: Lack of external accountability
Committees should have a designated leader responsible for ensuring that milestones or deadlines are met.





 cp0x:

I also like the idea of appointing a responsible committee member who must present the results of the work of the entire committee





 pedrob:

Problem 5: Lack of engagement with governance / community
Specific mechanisms for feedback from the broader community to the committees and vice versa could be further elaborated.


Its good practice to have a nonvoting member serving as facilitator (who only votes in case of a tie between other committee members). Usually, the best person to play this role is the creator of the framework or the one who brought the committee together, so they can also do the engagement with governance (as they did it earlier for passing the proposal in the first place). For example, I serve the facilitation role in the STEP screening committee.
Compensation for this facilitator should be the same as other committee members.



 JoJo:

I know all of the above rotates around compensantion


This is perhaps the trickiest part of it all. We should remember these are prestige postings and so not overcompensate; but also pay an amount that you can demand their time and don’t have to beg for it.
I’ve also found it helpful to peg their payment not to some arbitrary number , but to an external parameter no one really has control over. For example, in STEP we pay 500 ARB per member per valid application received.",5
21194,dk3,2024-02-16 08:24:48,"I wholeheartedly agree that traditional organization hierarchies work; modern businesses have had decades to refine to something that works today, however, whenever we try to impose this type of structure, it is met with vehement dispute, and I believe this is due to a mismatch on trust vs trustlessness, and trust is needed for this type of model to work, and we live in a don’t trust, verify world. Accountability and defined responsibility are key as a starting point, and being held accountable by the dao, I think, will never scale.  So we are in a weird limbo right now where trust is being established; ultimately, we will probably need something like a tri-party system executors/workhorses to get shit done, a board of delegates to hold the executors accountable and course correct them when needed “mgmt”, and some police/judicial group to monitor and investigate any contention or conflicts and bring that evidence to the dao to vote/enforce.
But as it stands today, we are not ready to trust anyone with any significant amount of capital and to have any kind of unilateral control. I think eventually we will move out of this growing maturity phase, but until then, the only things that are passing are committees and pilots, which imo is better than outright deadlock.",6

I think that the DAO has reached that stage in which we might need a community run twitter account to showcase, communicate, bring more awareness and also people together.
There are multiple community ran accounts such as ANDAO(who are killing it btw), but they serve the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole, the Arbitrum DAO currently does not have an “official  twitter account” that people can follow to see the 100% of latest developments, proposals and stuff that’s happening in the DAO!
Concentrating and connecting all the initiatives that are currently live in the Arbitrum DAO is not an easy task, but having an official DAO account can help:
-create a go-to resource for everything that’s happening in the DAO
-fill the information asymmetry gap
-people navigate around the DAO
-cement the Arbitrum DAO as a brand in web3

Hey @ZER8, have you explored using Push Protocol, it is a web3 communication network that enables cross-chain notifications. Notifications are sent to your web3 wallet and you can receive notifications straight to your phone, metamask, or the Push app whenever there is a new development in the DAO (this can be tailored to be whenever a new forum topic is posted).
This is much easier than say a DAO Twitter account, as it might not be practical to post every single forum post on Twitter. Feel free to reach out if this sounds like a good fit for Arbitrum DAO.

Introduction
This post aims to delve deeply into the mechanics and strategic advantages of implementing CDPs, specifically tailored to our Arbitrum DAO ecosystem growth programs, using our ARB token as the primary collateral. Our discussion will culminate in a dual call-to-action: integrating with a diverse range of DeFi lending platforms to Arbitrum and exploring the creation of an Arbitrum DAO-owned and managed CDP specifically for ecosystem growth.
A Novel Approach to CDP Management using DAO-Owned Liquidations
ARB CDP Flow1068×474 16 KB
In contrast to traditional CDP models, where positions are liquidated when collateral falls below a threshold, our approach introduces a DAO-owned liquidation mechanism. This mechanism ensures that additional collateral is injected to maintain a sufficiently collateralized state during market downturns, thereby providing a buffer against volatility. Conversely, when the price of the native token appreciates significantly, the DAO strategically liquidates the ARB collateral, using an optimized execution strategy to moderate market impact.
1. DAO Deposits Collateral:

The DAO starts by depositing ARB as collateral for funding positions.
In parallel, the DAO also deposits/holds stable assets (e.g., RWA stablecoins) to ensure absolute solvency in worst-case scenarios.

2. Stablecoin Issuance:

A stablecoin is issued against the deposited ARB collateral. LTV ranges from ~50%-70% in the current market. The stablecoins are then offered to grantees in lieu of ARB, which is the current convention.

3. Response to Price Increases:

If the price of ARB increases, it triggers strategic liquidations.
Following this, the DAO sells the ARB collateral and buys back stablecoins, squaring off the CDP partially or in whole.

4. Response to Price Decreases:

If the price of ARB decreases, an anti-liquidation bot gets triggered.
Consequently, the DAO deposits ARB as additional collateral to stabilize the position to keep the CDP solvent.

The above approach ensures that the system remains solvent and can handle significant price fluctuations in the collateral asset. The dual approach to dealing with price volatility—liquidation during price increases and additional collateral during price decreases—helps maintain the stability of the issued stablecoin and the collateral.
Our proposal envisages the implementation of CDPs in a manner where grantees can receive funding through diverse instruments - direct grants, term loans, convertible notes, SAFTs, or SAFE agreements. This flexibility allows for a tailored approach to funding, accommodating the diverse needs of our ecosystem growth programs.
Advantages of this Model

Risk Mitigation: By actively managing collateral levels at the DAO scale, we can significantly reduce the systemic risk associated with market volatility.
Flexibility and Autonomy: This approach provides the DAO with greater control over its financial operations, enabling more strategic capital management. The DAO gains significant flexibility in timing grants and liquidations. We can issue grants without the immediate need to liquidate assets, allowing us to choose the most opportune moments for market action. This flexibility also means we can proactively take positions, aligning with our spending plans for ecosystem growth and potentially improving financial outcomes.
Market Stabilization: A significant advantage of this approach is the ability to have DAO-owned liquidations. This means that Arbitrum DAO can directly control the liquidation process of ARB or other assets used as collateral. By doing so, we can strategically liquidate assets in a way that minimizes market impact and aligns with our broader market strategies. This approach contrasts sharply with relying on third-party liquidators, who may prioritize their interests over those of our DAO.

Case Study: Effective Market Stabilization by Arbitrum DAO
Executive Summary
This case study delves into how the Arbitrum DAO effectively stabilizes the ARB market, particularly focusing on its strategic interventions, assuming a lower limit and higher limit range to be the optimal bracket for the purpose of this study. Utilizing a combination of market absorption capacity, mean trading volume, and DAO interventions, this analysis showcases the innovative approach to managing both bearish and bullish market scenarios.
Market Context and ARB’s Position

Volatility and Liquidity: ARB experiences mean daily volatility of ~5.5%. Despite this, the market demonstrates robust liquidity, capable of absorbing $13.5 million in ARB sales daily with a -2% price impact.




Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability Research

The current market can absorb approximately $13.5 million in ARB sales daily with a 2% price impact, considering the combined liquidity from both on-chain and off-chain trusted sources.



Mean Trading Volume: ARB’s mean trading volume over the past 30 days stands at 423 million, indicating a significant market presence and trading activity.




Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability Research

In the past 30 days, the average daily trading volume was approximately 428.84 million ARB, equivalent to $670.43 million at the current price.


DAO’s Strategic Role

Operational Capacity: The DAO treasury positions itself to add collateral to CDPs in downtrends and to liquidate ARB in uptrends, aiming to stabilize the price within a lower and upper limit.
Decision-Making Process: Price levels are determined based on thorough market analysis, with the DAO adjusting its strategies in response to market conditions.

Scenario Analysis: Market Stabilization in Action
1. Bearish Market Scenario (Price Falling to Lower Limits):

Trigger and Initial Reaction: Triggered by external market factors, the price of ARB starts to fall towards the lower limit.
DAO Intervention: To prevent further downtrends as prices approach the lower limit price bracket, the DAO supplements CDP collateral. It strategically utilizes the DAO’s treasury and its capacity to provide additional collateral to avoid more sale of ARB and capping the DAO’s treasury further, preventing a further price drop due to ecosystem growth expenditure and managing spending limits more dynamically.
Outcome and Analysis: This action avoids mass liquidations, thus maintaining market confidence. The intervention is particularly effective in ensuring the LTV for ARB collateral CDPs remains within the 50-70% range.

2. Bullish Market Scenario (Price Approaching Upper Limits):

Market Uptrend: As ARB’s price nears the upper limit, there’s potential for overheating.
DAO Intervention: In this phase, the DAO implements controlled liquidations. By selling ARB systematically, it counters the rapid price increase.
Optimized Dilution: The managed liquidations could prevent overheating, by providing additional selling pressure in a timely manner. The DAO’s daily expenditure of ~360,000 ARB is effectively utilized to regulate overheated market scenarios.




Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability Research

Around 358,636 ARB per day from when allocations started (August 7th, 2023) to July 31st, 2024.


Expected Outcomes:

This approach prevents disparity in final grant size due to price fluctuations which can lead to over and under granting by using stablecoins for settlement of grant payments.




Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability - Working Group


The current situation of paying in ARB is disadvantageous to the DAO both ways: if ARB increases we are overpaying, if it decreases the project we funded is affected.




Arbitrum Treasury Management Report by Aera

For instance, this grant  intended to send 5500 USD for one of its payments. At the time of proposing this transaction in the multisig, 4,166.67 ARB was worth roughly 5500 USD. However, at the time of the transfer’s execution nearly two days later, it was worth 6233.70 USD, a whopping 13% premium that the Arbitrum DAO paid. In this case, the recipient received more ARB than they were entitled to, which is unlikely to cause complaint, but this just as easily could have gone the other way.





Incorporating DAO-Owned liquidations with CDPs ensures that our average daily expenditure of 360,000 ARB is diluted appropriately. While a large proposal of 70 million ARB the price impact can be catastrophic, however, with the flexibility offered by CDPs, the DAO can leverage the market’s daily absorption capacity more effectively. In the current market scenario, the combined daily buy side liquidity is ~$13 million. When done systematically, this can allow the DAO to liquidate 360,000 ARB daily which has negligible price impact. A 70 Mil ARB grant liquidated through CDPs provides the DAO with flexibility to liquidate over 200 trading days while providing capital to grantees today. Based on these numbers and the current market scenario, the DAO could effectively double its spending in dollar terms and still avoid having a significant impact on daily trading volume.

ARB buy side liquidty problem1629×657 68.4 KB


Improve sell side liquidity on DEXes. By acting as a maker, the DAO can offset shallow liquidity of bids in the order book by providing sell-side liquidity. Currently, most DEXes can only absorb $135,000 worth of buy orders before the price changes by 2% or more. By using the DAO’s spending strategically, we can ensure sufficient buy-side liquidity across DEXes.


Provides the opportunity to develop a versatile closed-loop mechanism that enables DAOs to transition grants into strategic investments, manifesting as either loans or equity stakes. This system offers grantees the flexibility to repay these financial instruments in a variety of forms according to the initial agreement’s terms. For loans, repayment can be made using stablecoins, reflecting a straightforward return of the borrowed funds. When the funding is provided as an investment, options for repayment expand to include returning value via a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), direct token allocations, a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), or even equity itself, depending on the nature of the initial investment and the agreement between the DAO and the grantee. This approach not only diversifies the DAO’s investment portfolio but also provides funded projects with tailored options to fulfill their obligations, thereby strengthening the ecosystem’s financial sustainability and fostering a more robust relationship between the DAO and its grantees.


Treasury Impact and Risk Management Strategy
The DAO currently has an annual expenditure of 131,400,000 ARB we explore diverse scenarios to path find an optimal solution to managing the DAOs growth funding strategies using CDPs.
Scenario 1: ARB as the Sole Collateral with an LTV of 50% (up to 300% net collateral)

Collateral Requirements:

The DAO will allocate ARB tokens equivalent to 200% of its annual spending, amounting to 262,800,000 ARB, to ensure a robust collateral ratio.
An Anti-Liquidation Collateral Matching Pool will be established with 131,400,000 ARB, serving as an additional buffer to safeguard against market volatility.


Total Treasury Impact:

This strategy results in a total allocation of 394,200,000 ARB from the treasury, significantly enhancing the CDPs financial resilience.



Scenario 2: Combined Collateral Approach with ARB and RWAs with an LTV of ~70% (up to 210% net collateral)

Collateral Composition:

Initial RWA allocation from Step 1 is valued at $48,650,000, based on the current VWAP of $1.39 per ARB, representing 35 million ARB.
The ARB collateral ratio is adjusted to approximately 140%, totaling 183,960,000 ARB.
An Anti-Liquidation Collateral Matching Pool with 96,400,000 ARB is set up to provide further market stability.


Total ARB Collateral Allocation:

Combining the ARB and RWA assets, the total collateral allocation reaches approximately 215%, or 280,360,000 ARB, ensuring a comprehensive risk mitigation framework.



Preliminary Recommended Debt Ceiling with Real-World Assets (RWAs)
In the context of incorporating Real-World Assets (RWAs) as outlined in Step 1, we propose a cautious yet strategic approach to setting our debt ceiling. This proposal is designed to ensure the Arbitrum DAO’s financial stability and solvency while optimizing our collateral framework.
Proposed Debt Ceiling and Justification:
•	Debt Ceiling: We recommend establishing a preliminary debt ceiling of $50 million USD. This ceiling is carefully calibrated to reflect the underlying value of RWAs committed in Step 1, providing a balanced framework for managing our CDPs responsibly.
•	RWA Holdings: Our RWA holdings, valued at $48,650,000 (based on a Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of $1.39 per ARB), form the cornerstone of this proposal. These assets serve as a robust foundation to guarantee our solvency, ensuring that we have a substantial buffer to cover potential liabilities.
•	Daily Liquidation Strategy: To maintain market stability and manage our debt obligations efficiently, we propose an average daily liquidation volume of $500,400 worth of ARB which is less than 4% of daily market absorption capacity of $13.5 million. This strategy is designed to minimize market impact, ensuring that we can meet our financial obligations without disrupting the ARB market.
•	Settlement Turnaround Timeline: We anticipate a settlement turnaround timeline of 90 to 100 days for the debt ceiling adjustments. This timeframe allows us to navigate market conditions effectively, providing enough flexibility to adjust our strategies in response to changing market dynamics.
By adopting this approach to setting our debt ceiling, we aim to balance risk management with our growth objectives. This framework not only ensures the CDP’s financial health but also ensures solvency of CDPs in the worst-case scenario.
Call to Action

Engage CDP Providers: We collaborate with CDP pools to join the Arbitrum ecosystem, leveraging their liquidity to foster a robust CDP market for ARB as collateral.
DAO-Managed CDP: We propose the exploration of a DAO-owned and managed CDP, which potentially offers greater capital efficiency and tighter control.

Conclusion
The implementation of this CDP mechanism on Arbitrum DAO represents a step towards more resilient and flexible financial operations in the DAO’s spending. This approach not only aligns with our group’s proposed strategic objectives to facilitate DAO-Owned Liquidations but also offers significant time alpha to allow the DAO to liquidate at higher valuations. We welcome thoughts, feedback, and active participation from the community in bringing this vision to fruition.",1
21109,cp0x,2024-02-08 13:03:05,"Hello,
I have some questions about your model.



 sids2000:

Risk Mitigation: By actively managing collateral levels at the DAO scale, we can significantly reduce the systemic risk associated with market volatility.


I don’t understand what kind of risk do we have. DAO just finance by ARB, which it already has in treasury. It’s no matter how much it costs, but we have some proposal about diversification, such as RWA. You are essentially proposing to make your own stablecoin with ARB collateral.



 sids2000:

Flexibility and Autonomy: This approach provides the DAO with greater control over its financial operations, enabling more strategic capital management. The DAO gains significant flexibility in timing grants and liquidations. We can issue grants without the immediate need to liquidate assets, allowing us to choose the most opportune moments for market action. This flexibility also means we can proactively take positions, aligning with our spending plans for ecosystem growth and potentially improving financial outcomes


The same as the previous point. DAO spend only ARB rn.



 sids2000:

Market Stabilization: A significant advantage of this approach is the ability to have DAO-owned liquidations. This means that Arbitrum DAO can directly control the liquidation process of ARB or other assets used as collateral. By doing so, we can strategically liquidate assets in a way that minimizes market impact and aligns with our broader market strategies. This approach contrasts sharply with relying on third-party liquidators, who may prioritize their interests over those of our DAO


I don’t understand how this gives an advantage to the DAO, since you are proposing to spend 260 million ARB to maintain the course.
To summarize, I want to say that creating your own synthetic stablecoin can provide benefits for DAOs, but this task is a little different from what you wrote.",2
20887,gauntlet,2024-01-26 19:23:41,"Background
On June 8th, 2023, Circle officially launched Native USDC on Arbitrum, signaling the start of a migration from Bridged USDC (USDC.e) to Native USDC. This transition marks a significant step for the Arbitrum ecosystem, as USDC offers unique benefits such as CCTP support and direct issuance from Circle, which are not available with USDC.e.
In response to Circle’s announcement, The Arbitrum Foundation partnered with Gauntlet on risk monitoring and providing protocol recommendations to facilitate this migration. The engagement then transitioned into grant analysis, helping with this process by identifying protocols that would be best suited to receive grants.
Selection Principles
The approach to selecting protocols for grants was grounded in data-driven analysis, aiming to minimize bias. The criteria were as follows:

Targeting High USDC.e Holdings: Priority was given to DeFi protocols holding significant amounts of USDC.e.
Visibility and Influence: Protocols with high Total Value Locked (TVL) were considered due to their broader influence and visibility within the ecosystem ideally leading to broader awareness.
Receptiveness to Grants: Protocols unable to increase USDC deposits with the assistance of grants were excluded from consideration.

Methodology
Based on the selection principles mentioned above, Gauntlet landed on the following methodology for identifying protocols that should receive grants:

Identify protocols with the largest TVLs (including borrows) on Arbitrum, filtering to those with greater than $30M TVL.
Of those protocols, the 4 protocols with the largest USDC.e TVL were selected, with the following caveats:

Bridges, due to their direct competition with Circle’s CCTP.
Single-asset protocols, as they require a complete TVL migration not suitable for incremental grants.
Protocols with specific TVL ratios, where grants are not a primary factor influencing user behavior.



Protocols Chosen
Based on the methodology above, we’ve identified the following 4 protocols, identified with an asterisk (*), as the best potential recipients for grants.

Grant Allocation Strategy
To minimize any bias in actually deciding grant amounts, it was determined that the best course of action is to distribute grants based on the 30D average combined TVL of USDC + USDC.e in each protocol as of 12/31/23, then allocate a $2M worth of ARB grant budget across those averages.
The resulting grant amounts can be seen below:

Protocol Specific Strategies
The objective for each protocol is to increase the USDC TVL via distribution of ARB rewards to USDC suppliers. All grant programs will persist for 3 months to balance the following objectives:

Maintain a conservative initial % APY boost to pools targeted for rewards
Allow enough time for TVL to stabilize with the goal of attracting long-term liquidity
Daily reward distribution should be sufficiently large to change user behavior

The details on how grants would be distributed throughout each protocol is detailed below.
Aave
We recommend distributing rewards on the Aave v3 USDC lending pool. This will encourage users to supply USDC, increasing the amount of USDC available to borrow, and increasing the utility of USDC on Arbitrum.
Uniswap
We begin with the top 5 USDC and USDC.e pools on Uniswap, respectively, sorted by TVL in decreasing order.
Top USDC.e Pools:
USDCe_pools2000×579 88 KB
Top USDC Pools:
USDC_pools2000×585 86.3 KB
(Snapshots as of 1/19/24)
Given that almost all of the USDC.e TVL on Uniswap is in the WETH-USDC.e pools (0.05% and 0.3% fee), we recommend targeting rewards on the WETH-USDC (0.05%) pool in order to attract WETH liquidity to the USDC pool.
Radiant
We recommend distributing rewards on the USDC lending pool.
Camelot
We begin with the top 10 USDC and USDC.e pools on Camelot sorted by TVL in decreasing order.
Camelot2000×1369 211 KB
(Snapshot as of 1/18/24)
For these 10 pools, we apply the following logic to determine our recommendation for each pool:


We ignore the USDC-USDC.e pool because rewards this pool could be counter-productive and increase USDC.e deposits


For a USDC.e pool, if there is no matching USDC pool

If the USDC.e pool is a protocol pool (provides liquidity for a protocol token), we recommend launching a matching USDC pool and facilitating the migration of their liquidity
If the USDC.e pool is not a protocol pool, we recommend launching a matching USDC pool and adding the matching USDC pool to the list of pools to target for rewards



For a USDC pool

If the USDC pool is a protocol pool, we recommend not adding additional rewards, since it is unlikely that users will contribute significant liquidity to these pools
Otherwise, if the USDC pool is not a protocol pool, we recommend adding rewards allocated based on TVL

Next Steps
The Arbitrum Foundation is already in contact with the protocols that have been designated to receive grants, and Gauntlet has provided input on an optimal grant rollout timeline. Grants will not be sent all at once, but instead will be staggered across the protocols over time. Starting shortly, grants will become available for a few of the designated protocols based on the above analysis, and details will be communicated by both Gauntlet and The Arbitrum Foundation.",1
20887,Trantor,2024-02-03 07:20:17,"The methodology here, with a focus on TVL, has some significant benefits and anything that drives wider native USDC adoption to Arbitrum is a plus.
Would be great to see some other approaches used as well. Notably, both Ramses Exchange and Trader Joe have the required TVL for wider consideration. Using incentives for only the biggest players once again provides outsized advantage to the larger players regardless of their relative performance.
Of course, the goal is USDC adoption etc, but funding allocations from the foundation make a big difference to how level the playing field is.
Looking very forward to the next set of ideas on how we can grow native USDC.",2

While I support the migration to native USDC, speaking as an Aave Delegate I do think the distribution should be done via designated finance and growth service provider like @karpatkey or TokenLogic. They are the one in charge of topics like this, meanwhile Gauntlet already delivered the risk analysis and overview which protocols will receive ARB.
Thank you for this proposal and the active push towards native USDC on the Arbitrum chain.",3
20652,Aera,2024-01-15 21:18:50,"DAO Treasury Goals
A well-managed treasury is the key to the sustainability and growth of a DAO, ensuring that there are sufficient funds to support ongoing operations, to invest in growth opportunities, and to navigate challenging market conditions. Treasury management is accomplished primarily through investment, which for most DAOs involves spending on initiatives that aim to generate substantial value in the future. As long as the amount spent is less than the value accrued, the investment is generally a good one.
For a DAO to be sustainable, it must have a strategic approach to planning for future projects in the long term, while ensuring that there are enough readily-available funds in the short term to support ongoing initiatives. Effective long-term planning involves forecasting future expenses and revenues, and assessing the risks of unforeseen costs or market moves. To ensure the DAO can continue to operate over the short term, it needs to be able to spend or liquidate assets from its treasury with sufficiently good execution to reliably cover immediate costs. In order to be set up for long term success, DAOs need to manage risk and adjust to changes in market prices (e.g. by dynamic rebalancing) and volatility (e.g. by volatility targeting).
In both cases, DAOs need tooling that is responsive to prevailing market conditions. Most DAOs would also prefer a process that is onchain, transparent, and non-custodial, to ensure alignment with community and broader DeFi objectives. In theory, this could be done by running a full governance vote every time a treasury decision is needed. However, in practice, the duration and operational overhead of governance cycles would severely limit the strategies these DAOs would be able to implement. Aera provides a DeFi-native treasury solution that ensures alignment with the DAOs community objectives, while also being highly responsive to market conditions in real time.
Effective Spending
Issuing grant awards and distributing incentives in ARB do not directly cause the price of ARB to move. It is only when award recipients seek to sell their ARB that price impact occurs. Award recipients can be urged to try to minimize their price impact when they eventually sell their ARB (e.g., using limit orders, splitting large orders up, spreading their trading out over time, etc.). However, once the tokens are distributed to the recipients, they can be sold at any time and for any reason. Furthermore, there is a compounding effect when a grant is issued to many recipients simultaneously, since they will likely seek to swap their ARB at around the same time, leading to greater price impact.
To keep this report focused, we are commenting exclusively on how to think about treasury management and price impact, while avoiding general discussions on how to optimize token distribution.
Financing Spend via ARB
The current approach toward financing grants and incentive programs is to directly utilize ARB as a form of payment. This means that recipients are free to sell their ARB as they see fit. First, we will examine the status quo of treasury management and then present ways in which it may be improved.
Benefits of Limit Orders
To begin, we look at DEX trading in ARB to get a sense for how efficient the market is. Since the Uniswap V3 ETH/ARB 0.05% pool has the most liquidity onchain at the time of this writing, we will focus mostly on this specific pool. The behavior of other onchain DEX pools where ARB is traded is broadly similar. In the following chart, the orange line shows the 6-hour average, while each blue dot represents a single swap. We have restricted the y-axis to only show slippage between 0.05% and 0.12%, as there are many swaps that far exceed these values.

There are periods of time where the average slippage increases by quite a bit. One of those is Sept 2023. If we line up some additional charts, we can see that this increase in average slippage does not actually line up closely with price, volume, or average swap size.
Untitled 11148×1206 94.4 KB
In fact, we can see that the large slippage around Sept 11 was incurred after the price had already fallen. Furthermore, when the price rebounded toward the end of September in similarly violent moves with increased volume, the average slippage was relatively unchanged at 5.5 bps. In short, this seems to suggest that patience is an appropriate response to high slippage.
We can also see that for each hour, it is regularly the case that individual swaps incur significantly larger slippage than the average 5.5bps—some swaps even incur an order of magnitude more than average!

All of this should be evidence that there are plenty of individuals who are executing swaps sub-optimally. The simple use of limit orders (setting a minimum expected amount out for a swap on a DEX) would significantly mitigate much of this slippage. Additionally, if any of these swaps are time-insensitive, the swappers could also leverage a TWAP algorithm or simply wait until the average slippage is closer to the usual 5.5 bps.
Liquidity
However, even with limit orders, liquidity conditions can still vary greatly. Here is a snapshot from Uniswap showing the liquidity distribution for the ETH/ARB 0.05% Uniswap V3 Pool on Dec 15, 2023:
Screenshot_2023-12-15_at_11.42.55_AM1764×934 32.2 KB
This shows that selling ARB would incur much more slippage than buying because there is less liquidity in that price range (selling ARB would execute against liquidity to the left of the red line). Shown below is the same chart on Jan 4, 2024, after a relatively large rally in the ARB/ETH price has occurred over the previous few weeks.
Screenshot_2024-01-04_at_9.28.22_PM1788×994 41.6 KB
Even for savvy traders who know to look at the liquidity conditions, these charts can be tricky to interpret since they are not drawn to scale. It turns out that significantly more ARB could actually have been sold on Dec 15 (750k ARB) than could have been sold on Jan 4 (190k ARB), before hitting a 2% slippage threshold. Looking at this data historically shows that the liquidity fluctuates quite frequently:

In September 2023, a swap as small as 113k ARB could have moved the price down by more than 2%, whereas a month later, you could have sold 1M ARB and not moved the market nearly as much. Not only do liquidity conditions vary month to month, but they vary day to day. If ARB recipients are unaware that these differences can exist, they could very easily sell when the liquidity conditions are poor and not only achieve a worse outcome for themselves, but also for other ARB holders.
CEX vs DEX
Since the data so far has focused on DEXs, one may argue that the full picture of liquidity is more stable if we include centralized exchanges. While some participants may prefer not to use CEXs or have limited access to them, we acknowledge that they may be a compelling alternative in some cases. For users that can choose whether to trade on a DEX or CEX, slippage may be somewhat mitigated by the fact that they can execute on multiple venues. The liquidity in Binance’s ARB/USDT market is generally much better than on DEXs.

However, we note that the benefit of CEX liquidity depends on where price discovery occurs. If price discovery occurs on the CEX and is transmitted to DEXs via arbitrage, the deeper liquidity of the CEX can help mitigate slippage. On the other hand, if CEX liquidity tends to follow the DEX price, the benefit is less clear since the seemingly plentiful CEX liquidity could move at a moment’s notice in response to a price change on a DEX.
While we did not have the ability to do a deep dive into Binance’s trade feed, we were able to review swaps in Uniswap’s v3 ETH/ARB 0.05% pool. Given that we are primarily interested in how grant and airdrop recipients liquidate their ARB, we attempted to focus solely on swaps that were unlikely to be bots. To accomplish this, we only considered swaps that had a single swap in their block and that were separated from the previous swap by at least 10s. Furthermore, given that a large rally in ARB/ETH began on Dec 22 (and is still ongoing), we separated the analysis in pre and post Dec 22.
Typical Market Conditions
The ARB/ETH market between April 2023 and Dec 2023 was generally flat or trending downwards as can be seen from this screenshot taken from CoinMarketCap:
Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 10.55.42 AM1922×856 61.4 KB
One would expect that large sells during this time period would impact the price. And in fact, that does appear to be the case.
To begin the analysis, we’ll first look at sell of 1000 ARB for ETH by an airdrop recipient (Arbiscan tx).

The ‘x’ highlights the current spot price of the Uniswap pool and the red triangle shows the effective price of the swap. The slippage incurred by this trade is ~5.2 bps. While the price didn’t react much immediately following the trade, the price did move down over the next 10 minutes.
Now that we have our bearings, we can look at what happens to the price on average for all swaps with a notional size >= 1000 ARB:

The spot price at the time of the trade is denoted by the ‘x’ markers and the effective execution price is centered at the (Trade, 0) point. Note that we’re showing both ARB buys and sells on this chart. We also show the average path across all trades to show that there is a very slight downward trend to the prices over this time period (April 2023 - Dec 2023).
There are two main points to take away: first, there is no momentum to these larger trades. Recall that the trade’s effective price is at a relative price of 0. The buys (sells) happen roughly 6 bps higher (lower) than the market price, and then the market adjusts to this price over the next few minutes, and then doesn’t really deviate from it (we show the average price paths over the next hour to confirm that there isn’t a delayed reaction).
Second, the lack of mean reversion suggests that these trades actually move the market. If they didn’t then there would be an arbitrage opportunity between the CEX liquidity and this DEX liquidity, and we would expect the price to revert back to its original price. Instead, the instantaneous slippage becomes the longer-term price impact.
Put another way, a grant recipient who receives 1000+ ARB and who decides to sell that ARB on Uniswap will on average move the entire market down by 5.5bps with their sale. Given that ARB’s circulating supply is roughly 1.3B, that’s quite the move. This is all the more reason for the Arbitrum DAO to own more of its ARB execution (we discuss this in more detail in the Protocol-Owned Execution).
During a Market Rally
We were lucky to experience a shift in market regimes in ARB during the period of this grant. Starting Dec 22, 2023, the price of ARB/ETH has seen explosive growth:
Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 5.11.26 PM1746×832 65.6 KB
Given that it’s transpired over a few weeks, this provides us with enough data to be able to make some statistical conclusions.
If we look at the same chart as before (but restrict ourselves to only looking at data on or after 22 Dec 2023), we see a very different situation.

As can clearly be seen, ARB has been appreciating at a significant rate. If the goal were to minimize market impact, one might naturally think that this is a great time to sell ARB. However, looking at the price impact relative to the average market movement tells a different story:

This shows the price trajectory relative to the baseline upward trend (the green line in the previous graph). Not only do large sells move the price down immediately, but there is momentum to the sale. In other words, not only is the price impacted at the time of the swap, but the entire market’s rally is diminished over the next several hours. During this period, swaps of 1000+ ARB slowed the rally by 12-20bps on average for each swap! Surprisingly, this is a much greater impact on a relative basis than when the ARB/ETH market was slowly trending downwards over time.
Downsides of Financing via ARB
All of these market nuances should be considered when the DAO is considering setting budgets for programs and specific grants. However, even with excellent historical analysis, it can be difficult to predict what the market conditions will be several weeks into the future. If a budget is set based on historical estimates (as was suggested here), then the allotted amount could just as easily overwhelm the available liquidity, or conversely, be an undersizing of what could have been deployed. The high variability of market liquidity conditions and likely suboptimal execution of uncoordinated ARB sales make financing via ARB an inefficient solution. This is especially true if the liquidation of ARB is left to award recipients. When ARB is distributed as the default form of funding, the vast majority of tokens will end up in the open market at some point, but with no predictability or optimization of their impact.
Improving the Spending Model
A natural question to ask (and indeed, the question that was posed by the Arbitrum Treasury Working Group) is “How can we minimize the price impact due to grant issuance?” under the implicit assumption that many ARB recipients will seek to liquidate their tokens relatively quickly to finance their own personal needs. There are three critical factors that should be considered:

The timing of distribution
Execution quality
The inherent utility of the token itself

Distribution Timing
While CFMMs used to be path independent, Uniswap V3 has introduced concentrated liquidity provisioning that allows liquidity providers (LPs) to provide liquidity in specified price ranges. After large price movements, if LPs haven’t adjusted their liquidity, the price may be much more sensitive to swaps. Given enough time, the liquidity eventually adjusts to follow the price.
In general, the longer the period of time over which tokens are sold, the lower the price impact will be. This is due to a simple argument: if the ecosystem continues to grow, then selling 1 ARB tomorrow will have less impact on the market than selling 1 ARB today due to there being greater demand and more token holders.
Adjusting how grants are distributed is also a useful lever. Staggering the release of ARB over strategic intervals can prevent market flooding, which leads to a decrease in price. Implementing a well-planned schedule that considers market conditions can significantly reduce negative price impacts. There are several ways for the DAO to achieve this, but they generally all involve introducing restrictions:

Gradual Distribution: Distributing rewards in smaller amounts at more frequent intervals is better than delivering a single larger amount (either at the beginning or at the end of a grant period). Much like dollar-cost averaging in investment strategies, this approach can reduce the impact of large liquidations.
Avoiding Synchronization: If an airdrop is announced and all eligible wallets can claim at the same time, then it is likely that the market will be flooded with sells. Much better would be to spread this distribution out over time. Here are some ideas for accomplishing this:

Staged Unlock: Releasing $ARB to different addresses at different times.
Continuous Unlocks: Releasing $ARB continuously over a period of time. For example, if tokens are released only once per month, then there would be a large group of sellers all seeking to sell their tokens at the same time. Much better would be to spread the distribution out over the entire month. Eligible recipients could claim whenever they would like, but they would only be able to claim a pro-rated reward. They would be able to claim their entire reward only after the distribution period is complete.
Market Dependent: Only distributing $ARB to holders when the current price, volatility, and liquidity meet certain criteria.
Outcome Dependent: If the $ARB being delivered to grant award recipients, it is better to set milestones and deliver $ARB at their completion than at the beginning or end of the grant time period.


Lock-Up: Recipients can agree to lock up their tokens for a particular amount of time. Similar to staking, they can be eligible to receive greater awards if they are willing to lock up their tokens for longer.

Great care needs to be taken with these methodologies since imposing restrictions can greatly reduce the perceived value of the locked-up portion of the grant. According to Gauntlet’s research, the implied discount associated with locked tokens is not compensated by a meaningful increase in long-term token holding behavior (see here).
Execution Quality
A second area where the treasury management process can be improved relates to the quality of execution. When ARB is exchanged for other tokens, either by the DAO or by grant recipients, execution relates to maximizing the amount of value realized per unit of ARB. We also consider some ways to improve execution and thus enhance the efficiency of treasury spending:

Own the Execution: If the belief is that ARB will be sold for ETH or a stablecoin, then it could benefit Arbitrum to manage that execution itself and to instead offer payouts in ETH or a stablecoin. This would require a governance vote, but a large block of ARB could be sold in an OTC transaction to a private investor or via an algorithm (e.g., TWAP through CoWswap, an order on Milkman, or an auction on UniswapX). The challenge here is that a vote is needed on execution parameters for every trade. Given that it can take several weeks for a governance proposal to be approved, it is important to be able to do the execution onchain in a transparent and market-aware way.
Market Maker Partnerships: Arbitrum could incentivize market makers to provide liquidity both on- and off-chain to stabilize the price during large distribution periods. Market makers specialize in providing on-demand liquidity and being able to unwind accumulated positions at appropriate points in time. As long as there was sufficient liquidity present in the current price range for the duration of a month, a market maker could be rewarded by token incentives.
Community Engagement: Ensuring that the community understands the best approaches for liquidating their tokens via public communications and marketing campaigns.
Limit Orders: a market sell order seeks to sell a particular quantity now at the current best available price. A limit sell order, however, seeks to sell a particular quantity at a particular price at some point in the future.

Utility
The final class of strategies for minimizing price impact due to token releases is to improve the utility of the token. This is somewhat obvious, and is something that DAOs and organizations are constantly doing. Nevertheless, it is useful to discuss here due to its influence on hold times. In general, if a token has utility, then recipients are more likely to directly use it within the ecosystem or hold onto it than to immediately seek to sell it. Efforts to bolster the token’s utility, demand, and overall market perception can contribute to a more resilient price structure. Here are some potential approaches to consider:

Staking: If participants can generate yield on $ARB, then they become more likely to stake and less likely to immediately sell. Of course, staking rewards come at a cost and should generate value for the ecosystem in excess of the tokens spent. The implementation of a specific staking program is a strategic mechanism design problem that is outside of the scope of this analysis.
Public Leaderboard: A public leaderboard can be effective at encouraging behavior. For instance, ranking holders based on how long they’ve held onto their distributions or on overall market impact that their tokens have had on $ARB based on LP and swap activity. This approach has been used with NFTs, but just as easily can apply to ERC-20 token ownership.
Social Media Recognition: Regularly feature long-term holders on social media platforms or community forums, providing them with recognition and status within the community.
Token Holder Rewards: Reward long-term holders via airdrops or by issuing NFTs for owning a minimum amount of $ARB for certain milestones. These NFTs could then grant special status within the ecosystem (e.g., access to discord channels, early access to articles, free educational content, discounts for events, etc). Voting in governance proposals could even be weighted by how long users have held their tokens.

Despite the options mentioned above, there are still significant challenges associated with each one. Restricting distribution reduces the perceived award value, enhancing the execution quality involves education initiatives and DAO coordination, and improving utility is something that should always be pursued.
Protocol-Owned Execution
Furthermore, no matter the environment, it seems reasonable to assume that there will always be ARB recipients who are not fully aware of the nuances of market microstructure or how best to liquidate their ARB. While the Arbitrum Foundation and DAO can endeavor to educate recipients and provide guidance on optimally liquidating ARB, it is important to acknowledge that recipients are under no obligation to follow such suggestions and strategies.
A more favorable scenario might be achieved if the DAO could also finance its grants with other tokens in addition to ARB. Note that this does not change the final token ownership distribution. The DAO is still distributing the same amount of ARB to the community. However, by owning the execution, the Arbitrum DAO is better able to control the price impact of the grant or award program. Furthermore, the users acquiring ARB during this distribution are doing so voluntarily in the open market, as opposed to ARB going to recipients who likely will seek to liquidate it to get capital to finance their grant’s mandate.
In short, the DAO should diversify its funding sources to include not only ARB but also ETH and stablecoins, and use all of these tokens to directly finance their grants. In so doing, the resulting price impact on ARB could be significantly mitigated.
To understand this better, consider that the DAO, in theory, could mimic the actions of less informed recipients by selling ARB in an indiscriminate manner. However, if the DAO strategically limited its sales to times when minimum thresholds for liquidity, volatility, and volume were met, it could markedly enhance the quality of execution. Furthermore, instead of selling ARB in an arbitrary, but restricted, time period, the DAO could anticipate ETH and stablecoin spends and proactively trade into those positions well before the assets are needed. This strategic approach could lead to more stable market conditions and potentially better financial outcomes for all parties involved.
Treasury Management Strategies
With any portfolio management strategy, there’s a certain amount of risk associated. While risk is often seen as a negative, higher risk can carry the opportunity for larger gains. The goal, then, is not to avoid risk entirely, but to make sure it is managed properly and that the amount of risk aligns with the goals for the portfolio. If funds are needed in the short term, a low risk strategy can preserve capital. If the funds are a long-term investment, a higher risk strategy can allow for more growth over time.
Since the risk of an asset isn’t directly measurable, we must estimate it using something we can directly measure. Intuitively, if the price of an asset is unpredictable and can change significantly from moment to moment (e.g., as is the case with ETH), then we think of it as riskier. If, on the other hand, the price of an asset is predictable and doesn’t change much (e.g., as is the case with stablecoins), then we think of it as safer. It seems reasonable that the volatility of the price, therefore, both acts as a good proxy for risk and can be directly observed.
The main difficulty with using volatility as a measure of risk is while we know what the volatility of the asset’s price was, we don’t know what it will be. A simple model is to assume that if an asset was volatile or stable in the past, it will continue to be so in the future.
We can calculate this historical volatility by computing the standard deviation of an asset’s daily returns:
1326×542 73 KB
Note: we have applied a standard bias correction when calculating the standard deviation
This calculation will generally be a decent prediction of the magnitude of tomorrow’s returns. The observant reader will immediately see that this value changes from day to day. This is actually a desirable property. Even though one can speak of assets as generally being safe or risky, they may not always remain that way in the future. For intuition’s sake, here are 90-day (i.e., n=90) historical volatility ranges for some well-known assets:

30-Year US Treasury Bonds: 5-15% (generally conservative)
SP500: 10-30% (aggressive)
ETH: 50-200% (very aggressive)

Just as an asset has volatility, so does a portfolio. If a portfolio consists of perfectly correlated assets, then we can just add the individual assets’ risks together to get the risk of the portfolio. However, if any of the assets are uncorrelated (or even anti-correlated), then the addition of these assets can actually reduce the portfolio’s risk. In short, the less correlated the assets are, the less overall risk.
Managing Risk
A simple treasury management strategy would be to hold everything in a single asset. This strategy exposes the treasury to the full risk of that asset, as the entire value is tied to that asset’s price. As contrived as this example seems, many DAO treasuries exclusively (or predominantly) carry just their native governance token. Arbitrum ($7.8B), Optimism ($3.3B), Uniswap ($2.7B), ENS ($1.6B), and Cardano ($840M) are all prominent examples of DAOs with large treasuries that (according to defillama) consist almost entirely of gov tokens.
A slightly more sophisticated strategy is to maintain a fixed allocation of assets. For instance, the DAO could target a fixed allocation of 90% ARB and 10% ETH. Balancer pools are well-suited for accomplishing these types of strategies. As prices change, arbitrageurs trade with the pool to maintain the notional balances. Over time though, the level of risk can vary as the volatility of each asset changes. For instance, if the volatility of ETH were to skyrocket, then what once was seen as a prudent allocation may now seem much too risky.
In order to more directly achieve this kind of control over risk, the DAO can opt instead for a volatility-targeting strategy. Instead of targeting a constant allocation of notional percentages, volatility targeting aims for a constant allocation of risk. While this may sound more complicated, in practice, the approach is straightforward and allows for a clear, intent-based approach to portfolio management. The intent is to maintain a steady amount of risk so the portfolio can grow while keeping assets available.
For instance, assume you have a portfolio of 100M dollars that needs to cover your runway for 3 months. You want to earn some yield on this money, but you also need to be able to cover any expenses along the way. If, after allocating these funds, the asset volatilities increased and prices started varying wildly, you’d probably want to move to more stable assets for safety. On the other hand, if the asset prices became more stable and risk went down, you might want to allocate more to seek controlled growth. Volatility targeting allows you to do this with a robust methodology.
Volatility Targeting
For a volatility targeting strategy, the approach can be simple:

Define the target risk level: Define the desired level of risk in terms of a target volatility. While we are often asked what a “good” target risk level is, each use case is different and can only be determined by the owner of the funds. That being said, we have generally seen DAOs seek portfolio allocations that target between 5% and 20% annualized volatility for the non-governance token portion of their portfolio.
Estimate the current portfolio volatility: Calculate the volatility of each asset and the correlations between them, then weight them by the current portfolio allocation.
Adjust the portfolio allocation : Once the target and current volatility levels have been established, the asset allocation can be changed to match the target.
Monitor and rebalance: Monitor the portfolio’s volatility on an ongoing basis and rebalance as necessary to maintain the target level of risk.

Experimental Results
For concreteness, we present some results for a hypothetical DAO that is targeting 20% annualized volatility for a portfolio of ETH and DAI. Per above, this level of volatility is similar to that of the S&P500.
Since both the volatility and the prices of assets change over time, the portfolio needs to be constantly monitored and adjusted. Shown below are the weights produced by our algorithm that leverages historical volatility to predict the future volatility:

As can be seen, the weights change quite frequently. While the allocation to ETH is generally in the 20-40% range, there are times where ETH was riskier than average and only 5% of the portfolio was allocated to ETH. There also were times where ETH prices were relatively quiescent, and over 80% of the portfolio was allocated to ETH. This variation might seem risky, but it turns out that it does a pretty good job of controlling a portfolio’s risk even though ETH’s volatility frequently was in excess of 100%.

Lastly, we can also see this qualitatively by looking at the historical returns. Not only is the volatility greatly reduced, but the average returns are comparable (at least for this period of time):

In terms of actual returns, while the portfolio underperformed being fully in ETH when prices rose rapidly (2021-2022), it also protected against losses when ETH dropped (2018-2021). The net result is that this strategy can still achieve exposure to a desirable risky asset without putting too much of its assets at risk.

For completeness, these are the portfolio returns associated with different volatility targets. As the target volatility increases, both the losses and gains do as well. However, the risk-adjusted returns (and the associated Sharpe ratio) for the volatility-targeted strategy can be much higher than a fixed notional allocation (which includes 100% ETH). Put another way, the returns achieved by a volatility-targeted portfolio can be higher per unit risk.
How Aera Supports Treasury Management
As the DAO treasury management landscape continues to evolve we have seen the solution space roughly fall into 3 buckets:

One time treasury diversification - a static and point in time approach to treasury management that covers immediate needs of the DAO but doesn’t have a long term approach to treasury sustainability. This is a principled approach, but doesn’t evolve over time
Centralized treasury management - where the DAO elects a treasury manager who has some restrictions on what they can do via smart contracts, but otherwise has broad remit on what asset class choices and investment strategies they can employ. This breaks a lot of the properties that DAOs seek to achieve like credible neutrality, limiting points of failure and others.
Inaction by democracy - where the DAO makes large reallocation decisions based on voting. This is hindered by misaligned incentives from DAO members and apathetic/uninterested voters. In the worst case the DAO takes no action, and in the best case the DAO compromises to achieve consensus amongst voters.

From this we can see 3 pillars of a perceived treasury management trilemma: decentralization, principled allocation, and effective allocation.
Faced with three choices that are fundamentally unappealing, DAOs choose to keep their capital largely unallocated.
Breaking the Treasury Management Trilemma
graphic 2841×704 32.8 KB
Aera is a solution that achieves all three desirable properties: trustless, principled & responsive treasury management. Here’s how that works:
Aera achieves responsiveness and efficacy by using off-chain guardians
Guardians are able to build complicated data pipelines and strategies to ensure that treasuries are managed using best available market instruments, are risk-aware, liquidity-aware and otherwise responsive to market conditions. Allowing for offchain logic means that the strategy space is much wider and not limited to strategies that can only be computed onchain (which is often very small due to computational constraints).
Aera achieves trustlessness by limiting what guardians can do at the protocol level
A comprehensive hooks contract is used in each vault that limits the types of actions that a guardian can take and how they can impact the vault, bounding possible loss. Every action a guardian takes happens with assets that are approved by the DAO, with actions that are whitelisted and with consequences that are within the approved parameters of the treasury owner. Safety first. Trustlessness will further improve as the initial permissioned model will evolve to a permissionless implementation with progressive decentralization. Unlike other solutions for treasury management, Aera strikes a balance on trust and responsiveness by constraining the actions a guardian can take while still holding them to a clear objective and success criteria.
Aera achieves principled strategies through the use of a custom objective function for each treasury
The stated objective function serves as a point of alignment between the DAOs objectives and the guardians’ actions. Guardians are incentivized to act only in ways that improve the objective function of the vault and not limited to simple strategies like seeking yield without consideration of insolvency or other risk vectors. Complex objectives necessitate using multiple strategies together, and Aera can decompose this into a set of strategies that work in tandem (see the Case Study below for an example of this in practice).
Aera in more detail
Aera is a 2-sided protocol: Depositors like DAOs who are Owners of the vault and Guardians who optimize the vault according to the Owners objective function.
graphic 11264×565 36.2 KB
An Owner initially deposits into the vault, selects the objective function (i.e. a Risk managed portfolio via Volatility targeting, a Yield strategy to generate ETH yield via leverage, Asset diversification using onchain exchanges etc.), the set of assets that the vault is allowed to trade, DeFi protocols it’s allowed to interact with. Additionally the Owner can set more constraints on the vault via a customizable hooks module. Some example hooks could be: the vault is not allowed to lose more than 3% of its portfolio value in notional terms in a given day, or the vault must always contain 10,000 of a given token at all times.
Once the Owner deposits into the vault the Guardian begins to optimize it against the objective function prescribed by the DAO.
As above Guardians can implement whatever offchain logic and additional modeling they want to achieve the DAOs goal, in the case of the DAO choosing a Risk strategy via volatility targeting, the guardian may build ETLs and models to fetch asset price data and compute volatility. They could extend this to fetch implied volatility from deribit or other centralized venues if this is helpful for achieving the DAOs objective.
From here on, the Guardian submits rebalance operations against the vault on a regular cadence (i.e. daily, weekly) in a continuous optimization process.
The Guardian is limited in what it can do at a smart contract level. The Guardian is not able to withdraw assets from the vault or do anything that will break the invariants set up in the vault via the hooks module. All operations must happen onchain and leverage other DeFi protocols making Aera strongly transparent. Critically, the constraints of the Vault prescribed in the smart contract logic, means that Guardians need to strongly automate their strategies. This limits the discretion that the Guardian has and gives the Treasury Owner stronger guarantees and confidence around achieving the objective, while minimizing the surface area for mistakes and other risks. Automation drives consistency and removes logistical overhead for the DAO.
Due to this blend of onchain constraints and offchain logic, Owners using Aera get a system that is non-custodial, transparent, and efficient at achieving their goal. In summary, Aera is a robust and composable protocol that can support a variety of objectives for DAOs:

Treasury Diversification
Risk Managed Portfolio Management (via volatility targeting)
Runway management
Yield generation

Achieving Diversification through Intent-Based Governance
Ultimately, this discussion boils down to diversifying the treasury and improving execution quality. There have been recent discussions on investing in real-world assets (RWAs) such as US Treasury Notes and Bonds. This is certainly valuable, and we strongly encourage continuing this discussion. However, there is no reason to restrict the diversification to RWAs. Even the straightforward approach of purchasing and holding a more optimized mix of assets such as ETH and stablecoins can be beneficial to a DAO.
The ENS DAO’s Treasury (wallet.ensdao.eth) is a great example of strategic treasury management. Their treasury regularly holds ENS, ETH, and USDC and finances the DAO’s activities with a mix of tokens. For instance, the following proposal funds the ENS Meta-Governance Working Group for 2024 Q1 with all three assets. ENS DAO has revenue streams denominated in ETH (similar to Arbitrum DAO’s sequencer revenue). They sold a large block of ETH for USDC via CoW Swap (see EP3.3 for the discussion). While this can work for a liquid pair at a trade size of 10k ETH ($13M USD notional at the time), it would likely be much more difficult to accomplish this same feat using larger amounts of less liquid assets (e.g., financing the Arbitrum DAO for a quarter by selling $100M worth of ARB). All things considered, the ENS DAO’s treasury has made substantial progress in managing reserves strategically, despite relying on a fully governance-driven strategy.
However, it is also very inefficient to implement any kind of dynamic strategy entirely via governance due to proposals generally being subjected to discussion periods, temperature checks, on-chain votes, and lockup periods (See Lifecycle of an AIP). By the time a proposed transaction is actually executed, the market conditions could be fairly different than the original conditions during which the original proposal was being discussed.
Arbitrum DAO can delegate this process to a committee that is responsible for managing grants programs via multisigs (e.g., similar to the Arbitrum Grants structure here). This streamlines the decision-making, but it still requires the DAO to trust the signers, is subject to human error, reduces the security of the allocated funds, and can still be slow to react to market events (because ultimately, human beings still need to be informed and coordinated).
Another challenge is that even though these grants programs are being funded with ARB, proposal amounts are actually denominated in USD. Specifically, the proposal funding the Arbitrum Grants project as well as the actual Questbook grant proposals are all denominated in USD. However, the payment is actually funded with an equivalent amount of ARB. Not only does this create friction for the actual process, but it introduces price risk due to the timing delay between when the payment is proposed to the multisig and when it is finally executed.
For instance, this grant intended to send 5500 USD for one of its payments. At the time of proposing this transaction in the multisig, 4,166.67 ARB was worth roughly 5500 USD. However, at the time of the transfer’s execution nearly two days later, it was worth 6233.70 USD, a whopping 13% premium that the Arbitrum DAO paid. In this case, the recipient received more ARB than they were entitled to, which is unlikely to cause complaint, but this just as easily could have gone the other way.
A much better solution would be for the Arbitrum DAO to leverage automated tooling (such as the tooling that Aera is currently building) that would effectively allow the DAO to vote on intentions such as keeping the treasury well-balanced and diversified while ensuring funding is available for grants programs.
For instance, a proposal could be made to allocate 85% of the treasury to ARB, 5% to RWAs, 5% to ETH staking, and 5% to yield-generating stablecoins. These allocations could be notional percentages or risk percentages (to learn more about volatility targeting strategies, see the earlier section on them). A proposal could similarly be made to ensure that there are sufficient assets available to fund the upcoming quarter. The automated tooling would then be responsible for the actual logistics of achieving the intent (i.e., swapping into the desired amounts over time). Independent of what the actual allocation is, diversifying and automating at least a portion of the treasury management leads to the following benefits:

Reduction of market risk (through diversification)
Additional yield (through RWAs, staking, and lending)
Ability to finance DAO operations and programs with greater flexibility and lower market impact
Increased liquidity and stability of ARB (by dynamically maintaining a strategic buffer, the DAO could opportunistically both sell and buy back ARB based on market conditions)
Lastly, and most importantly, Arbitrum DAO is able to spend its time focusing on higher-level concerns such as what to spend on as opposed to lower-level implementation and execution details.

Appendix - Aera Case Study
Background
Threshold DAO partnered with Aera V2 to enhance its treasury management. The goal was straightforward: diversify Threshold’s treasury assets and manage the proceeds in a risk aware manner.
Strategy: Focusing on Volatility Management
The core strategy involved allocating $250K of T tokens to an Aera Vault, with a focus on volatility management. Threshold DAO chose a volatility-targeting strategy to mitigate risk and stabilize returns. This approach is helpful to control for risk, ensuring that while diversifying into assets like ETH and USDC, the portfolio’s volatility remained around 15%. This strategy helped Threshold maintain a steady growth trajectory without excessive risk exposure.
Diversification and Market Dynamics
The diversification process achieved less than 0.5% slippage, and did not affect the T token’s market price. We were able to diversify out of the initial allocation over the course of 6 weeks. We observed this low market impact due to offchain arbitrageurs coming in to rebalance the onchain DEXes.
Yield Generation: Utilizing Aera’s Versatile Architecture
Aera’s platform, capable of integrating any ERC20 or ERC4626 asset, made it easy to generate yield on the vault holdings. These protocol features enabled efficient use of idle ETH and USDC. By incorporating wstETH, Threshold maximized yield on Ethereum holdings, and through Aave USDC, they effectively utilized the USDC proceeds. Aera’s system provided a straightforward and effective approach to enhancing asset productivity within the DeFi ecosystem. Currently the vault is generating 5.16% APY with a high of 6.27% APY
Operational Excellence and Results
Aera made all this possible by removing the overhead from the Treasury Guild to think through execution of the strategy. After selecting the initial volatility target and diversification criteria, the Treasury Guild did not need to take further action to drive the execution of the strategy. Since the vault’s inception 2 months ago Aera has rebalanced the vault 74 times to achieve the Guilds selected goals. The ability to efficiently manage and rebalance the assets has been critical in DeFi’s rapidly changing market.
Security and Safety: Enhanced Protection and Verified Trust
Aera prioritizes the security of its protocol and the safety of user funds. Owners of Aera vaults can rest assured of the protection against unauthorized access, as the system is non-custodial and guards against misappropriation and malicious actions by Guardians. The protocol offers customized security measures, enabling clients like Threshold DAO to establish specific, tailored constraints for their vaults. This adaptability facilitates bespoke risk management strategies, and gives granular control to the Owner over allowed Assets, Exchanges, and DeFi Protocols. A key constraint is the vault value check, a mechanism designed to cap daily loss to a maximum of 3%, thereby shielding against potential guardian malfeasance.
Further solidifying its security posture, Aera’s infrastructure has undergone a comprehensive audit by Spearbit, adding a significant layer of credibility and reassurance. This blend of customizable security measures and rigorous auditing underscores Aera’s dedication to upholding the highest standards in fund safety and risk control within the realm of DeFi treasury management.
Conclusion
The partnership between Threshold DAO and Aera V2 demonstrates the importance of a well-executed volatility management strategy in DeFi. By focusing on stable growth and leveraging the evolving onchain dynamics, Threshold was able to optimize its asset portfolio, underscoring the potential of DeFi in modern treasury management.",1

 dk3:

a tldr at the top would probably help with engagement


It’s an extremely thought-provoking report but also difficult to fully digest in one sitting, so here’s a breakdown of its key ideas.
Problem

There is high variability in liquidity and slippage when liquidating ARB onchain.




 Aera:

It turns out that significantly more ARB could actually have been sold on Dec 15 (750k ARB) than could have been sold on Jan 4 (190k ARB), before hitting a 2% slippage threshold.





 Aera:

In September 2023, a swap as small as 113k ARB could have moved the price down by more than 2%, whereas a month later, you could have sold 1M ARB and not moved the market nearly as much.



Poor onchain liquidity can cause adverse ARB price impact in even the deeper CEX market




 Aera:

if CEX liquidity tends to follow the DEX price, the benefit is less clear since the seemingly plentiful CEX liquidity could move at a moment’s notice in response to a price change on a DEX.



These are urgent matters as we award grants in $ARB and teams do not always follow or know best practices for liquidation to meet their project expenses.




 Aera:

If ARB recipients are unaware that these differences can exist, they could very easily sell when the liquidity conditions are poor and not only achieve a worse outcome for themselves, but also for other ARB holders.



These present a strong case for us to own our own execution, as a grantee liquidating as little as 1000+ ARB on Uniswap can move the market by 5.5 bps.




 Aera:

Put another way, a grant recipient who receives 1000+ ARB and who decides to sell that ARB on Uniswap will on average move the entire market down by 5.5bps with their sale. Given that ARB’s circulating supply is roughly 1.3B, that’s quite the move. This is all the more reason for the Arbitrum DAO to own more of its ARB execution (we discuss this in more detail in the Protocol-Owned Execution).



Even in bull market conditions, a price rally gets diminished due to onchain liquidations




 Aera:

In other words, not only is the price impacted at the time of the swap, but the entire market’s rally is diminished over the next several hours. During this period, swaps of 1000+ ARB slowed the rally by 12-20bps on average for each swap!



Moreover we end up overpaying grantees when denominated in ARB, while a reduction would cause inability to meet their project goals




 Aera:

For instance, this grant intended to send 5500 USD for one of its payments. At the time of proposing this transaction in the multisig, 4,166.67 ARB was worth roughly 5500 USD. However, at the time of the transfer’s execution nearly two days later, it was worth 6233.70 USD, a whopping 13% premium that the Arbitrum DAO paid. In this case, the recipient received more ARB than they were entitled to, which is unlikely to cause complaint, but this just as easily could have gone the other way.


Community Solutions

Spread out grants over a time period rather than all at once (such as with hedgey)
Spread out distribution based on external parameters such as grantee achieving milestones or upon ARB price/liquidity
Greater rewards to those locking up their tokens for a particular amount of time
Encouraging limit orders by grantees
Incentivizing market makers to provide liquidity during large distribution periods

Increasing ARB Utility

Generating yield on $ARB can make participants stake instead of immediately selling. The challenge is designing staking system that generates value for the ecosystem in excess of tokens spent
Public leaderboards of $ARB hodlers and giving them recognition in some form
Rewards such as greater voting rights for those users who have long held their tokens

Protocol Owned Execution



 Aera:

The DAO is still distributing the same amount of ARB to the community. However, by owning the execution, the Arbitrum DAO is better able to control the price impact of the grant or award program.





 Aera:

if the DAO strategically limited its sales to times when minimum thresholds for liquidity, volatility, and volume were met, it could markedly enhance the quality of execution. Furthermore, instead of selling ARB in an arbitrary, but restricted, time period, the DAO could anticipate ETH and stablecoin spends and proactively trade into those positions well before the assets are needed. This strategic approach could lead to more stable market conditions and potentially better financial outcomes for all parties involved


Treasury Management
This part of the report is highly sophisticated and relatively difficult for a layman to grasp. Here’s the key points as I understood them;
Treasury management takes one of three forms (trilemma)


Hiring a centralized treasury manager (principled and responsive but requires trust)


One-time treasury diversification covering immediate needs but not evolving over time (trustless and principled but not responsive)


coinvoting based diversification (responsive and trustless but not principled)


Aera proposes a unique approach for breaking out of this trilemma : the use of autonomous volatility based adjustments in a DAO portfolio



 Aera:

The intent is to maintain a steady amount of risk so the portfolio can grow while keeping assets available.
For instance, assume you have a portfolio of 100M dollars that needs to cover your runway for 3 months. You want to earn some yield on this money, but you also need to be able to cover any expenses along the way. If, after allocating these funds, the asset volatilities increased and prices started varying wildly, you’d probably want to move to more stable assets for safety. On the other hand, if the asset prices became more stable and risk went down, you might want to allocate more to seek controlled growth. Volatility targeting allows you to do this with a robust methodology.


The steps for such a strategy include:

Define a target between 5% and 20% annualized volatility for non-governance token portion of the treasury
Calculate volatility of each asset
Assign weights to each asset by current portfolio allocation
Keep target fixed and rebalance weights according to actual volatility of an asset

An example of how this might play out for an ETH-DAI pool in arbitrum’s treasury



 Aera:

While the allocation to ETH is generally in the 20-40% range, there are times where ETH was riskier than average and only 5% of the portfolio was allocated to ETH. There also were times where ETH prices were relatively quiescent, and over 80% of the portfolio was allocated to ETH.


This strategy prevents massive gains but also protects against huge losses



 Aera:

In terms of actual returns, while the portfolio underperformed being fully in ETH when prices rose rapidly (2021-2022), it also protected against losses when ETH dropped (2018-2021). The net result is that this strategy can still achieve exposure to a desirable risky asset without putting too much of its assets at risk.


The report then ends with a case study on the use of Aera and hints at a future diversification proposal based on these ideas



 Aera:

For instance, a proposal could be made to allocate 85% of the treasury to ARB, 5% to RWAs, 5% to ETH staking, and 5% to yield-generating stablecoins. These allocations could be notional percentages or risk percentages (to learn more about volatility targeting strategies, see the earlier section on them). A proposal could similarly be made to ensure that there are sufficient assets available to fund the upcoming quarter. The automated tooling would then be responsible for the actual logistics of achieving the intent (i.e., swapping into the desired amounts over time). Independent of what the actual allocation is, diversifying and automating at least a portion of the treasury management leads to the following benefits:

Reduction of market risk (through diversification)
Additional yield (through RWAs, staking, and lending)
Ability to finance DAO operations and programs with greater flexibility and lower market impact
Increased liquidity and stability of ARB (by dynamically maintaining a strategic buffer, the DAO could opportunistically both sell and buy back ARB based on market conditions)
Lastly, and most importantly, Arbitrum DAO is able to spend its time focusing on higher-level concerns such as what to spend on as opposed to lower-level implementation and execution details.

20652,chainmonky,2024-01-17 06:14:46,"This is very well articulated, thanks for the report team. I have few suggestions which might be useful



 Aera:

Lock-Up: Recipients can agree to lock up their tokens for a particular amount of time. Similar to staking, they can be eligible to receive greater awards if they are willing to lock up their tokens for longer.


This is a good thought, so can we think around implementing some sort of ve tokenomics or we can do with some debt market place where in users can lock up the ARB tokens and mint some other tokens or get the decent APY more than what is available in the markets.

Thinking around more use cases to motivate users locking up the funds should help the DAO mitigating the price impact




 Aera:

Token Holder Rewards: Reward long-term holders via airdrops or by issuing NFTs for owning a minimum amount of $ARB for certain milestones. These NFTs could then grant special status within the ecosystem (e.g., access to discord channels, early access to articles, free educational content, discounts for events, etc). Voting in governance proposals could even be weighted by how long users have held their tokens.


I like the way ether_fi played this game well by issuing nfts in tiers and letting the users stake for the long duration but for us we should think of strong use cases where in we will issue nft which will be dynamic (for may be holding ARB) & we can do this by partnering with ecosystem projects which will open lot of gamification
Diversification is also an important thing for good treasury management, now we have many diversification tools like RWA, stablecoins, debt marketplace …etc

20903,Bluntrazor,2024-01-27 08:49:27,"Synapse Protocol is playing with rules. They treat users as tools, selling ARB distributed through STIP for USDC, and funneling it into team’s wallet!
I propose to revoke Synapse’s STIP allocation, and in the future, refrain from providing any ARB incentive quotas to them.
Synapse Protocol proposes to distribute ARB rewards based on users’ cross-chain quotas but has covertly increased the cross-chain bridge fees to offset the ARB rewards received by users, effectively channeling the STIP ARB rewards to the team. For example, when native USDC is cross-chain from AVAX to Arbitrum, Synapse promises to provide users with a 5 bps reward, but the cross-chain bridge fee is increased to as ridiculous as 4 bps. In reality, 80% of the ARB incentives go to the team. To exacerbate matters, on 20240127, the Synapse team suddenly reduced the reward from 5 bps to 4 bps without any announcement, aligning it with the cross-chain bridge fee, thereby diverting ALL STIP ARB rewards to the team. For example, if I bridge 100k USDC from AVAX to Arb, they will charge me 40 USDC, and send me 22.441 ARB(which equals 40 USDC in value).
According to their STIP applicant info. They plan to build a slippage-free bridge by the help of STIP. Yes, they made it, but in a really sneaky bad way.",1

We recently received a grant from Plurality Labs to build a decentralized grant evaluation platform. We will use this thread to keep the community updated on our progress.
Grant Details
Provide a summary of your intended program & the impact
Karma GAP is a protocol for tracking and ensuring accountability of community-issued grants. It enables grantees to set and update milestones, allowing communities to monitor progress and assess the impact of projects.
Our mission is to create a neutral system for evaluating funding, giving communities and grant programs the data needed to discern effective projects and decide on funding allocations.
Problem
Below are specific problems we would like to solve for the Arbitrum Grant ecosystem.

Insufficient visibility of grant issuance, progress, and outcomes
Lack of data for community-driven decisions on grant category funding adjustments.
No mechanism for grantees to establish a track record.
Inadequate information to gauge the impact of specific projects or categories.
The community is willing to engage but lacks a structured way to contribute.

How does your project meet one or more of our strategic priorities outlined above?
Our project aligns with strategic priorities:

Achieve GOVERNANCE OPTIMIZATION by identifying and iteratively improving key capabilities to increase DAO performance and accountability.


Capital allocation is crucial for DAOs. Implementing GAP yields insights and transparency, leading to improved capital distribution choices.


GROW THE COMMUNITY through awareness, participation, efficient inquiry handling, and bias reduction.


Creating a reviewer system to engage the community aims to boost DAO awareness and involvement, potentially enhancing other activities such as governance voting and delegation.


How do you plan to execute this program (Specification & Implementation)?

We intend to implement Karma GAP for Arbitrum DAO’s grantees to report updates, allowing community evaluation of the projects. All data will be on-chain on Arbitrum One.
Our solution addresses the outlined problems as follows:


Visibility: Integration with Arbitrum One allows grantees to create projects and outline milestones for received grants, with regular update postings. The Arbitrum community gains the ability to monitor all grants and their progress.


Data-Driven Decisions: We’re developing a feature for grantees and community members to assess grants on various metrics. This data, stored on-chain, will be available for public analysis.


Grantee Reputation: A profile page will showcase grantees’ grants and their statuses, useful for future grant applications within the Arbitrum ecosystem or elsewhere.


Impact Measurement: Projects will be categorized to facilitate community access to categorized evaluation outcomes.


Community Contribution: A reviewer system will enable community members to assess grants matching their expertise. We will collaborate with Plurality Labs to establish measurable reviewing standards.


What are your Milestones?


Below are all the specifications broken down by milestones.
Milestone 1: Add support for Arbitrum One (2 weeks) and Categorize grants for better evaluation (1 week) - Due Dec 8, 2023
Deploy smart contracts on Arbitrum One, update front and back-end systems for One compatibility. Post-Milestone 1, grantees can create projects and update grants with all data stored on Arbitrum One.
In collaboration with Plurality Labs, we will define project categories and update our system to classify projects accordingly. Post-implementation, community members can browse grants by category.
Milestone 2: Feature for grantees to describe how their project should be evaluated (1 week), anyone should be able to evaluate projects (3 weeks) and integrate Open Source Observer (1 week) - Due Jan 12th, 2024
To assess impact, projects must be evaluated using criteria set by those who know them best—the grantees. We will build a feature allowing grantees to specify their evaluation metrics, ensuring transparency as these will be publicly viewable. This information will be on-chain and retrievable via our SDK or an indexer for quick access.
Community members can declare their expertise, self-nominate as reviewers, and evaluate grants. A dedicated page will display each reviewer’s grant assessments, aiding in building their reputation. We will introduce measures to filter out Sybil (fraudulent) reviews. Recognizing the complexity of this issue, we will refine the reviewer system continually, guided by community input.
We will integrate with Open Source Observer to include their analytics in the GAP application for projects linked to GitHub repositories, offering funders insight into the impact of open source contributions on ecosystem health.

How will the community validate impact?

The community can apply GAP’s evaluation framework to assess GAP itself using these metrics:

The proportion of grantees regularly updating their grant progress.
The count of reviewers analyzing different grants.
The community’s ability to discern impactful grant categories and inform future funding decisions.

Success is marked by the community’s capacity to use these indicators to guide funding strategies.",1

20838,Web3Wanderer,2024-01-24 05:31:22,"Hello everyone,
I’ve been deeply exploring the transformative world of asset tokenization, and I’m thrilled to share and discuss its myriad use cases with you. Tokenization is paving the way for fractional ownership and broader access in fields ranging from real estate and fine art to the unique market of vintage wines. Join me in exploring how this new trend is revolutionizing various industries and changing our perspectives on asset management.
1. Real Estate: Real estate investment has traditionally been capital-intensive, but tokenization is changing that. By converting property rights into digital tokens, real estate investments become more accessible, allowing fractional ownership. How might this transform real estate market dynamics?
2. Art and Collectibles: Art & Collectibles Tokenization is introducing a new era in the art and collectibles market, where fractional ownership is now possible. This could democratize access to valuable art pieces and collectibles. Could this lead to a broader and more dynamic art market?
3. Commodities and Natural Resources: Tokenization enables investments in commodities like gold, oil, or renewable energy through digital tokens. This could revolutionize commodity trading. What are the implications for the commodity market?
4. Personal Assets and Intellectual Property: From cars to intellectual property like patents or music rights, tokenization is redefining asset liquidity and ownership. How will this impact individual asset holders and creators?
5. Wine Tokenization: The fine wine market is ripe for disruption with tokenization. By tokenizing rare and vintage wines, investors can own fractions of valuable bottles, potentially making wine investment more accessible and diverse. This could also ensure better provenance tracking and authenticity verification. What effects could this have on the wine industry and investment patterns?
The scope of asset tokenization spans various industries, raising questions about regulatory, technical, and ethical considerations. I’d love to hear your insights:

How do you envision asset tokenization impacting your sector?
What are the potential risks and challenges in this evolving landscape?
Are there any other unique use cases for asset tokenization that come to mind?

20474,Web3Wanderer,2024-01-07 18:41:11,"Hello everyone,
I’ve been pondering a topic that seems to be on the fringes of our usual DeFi discussions: the integration of Real-World Assets (RWAs) into Decentralized Finance. I believe this intersection can be revolutionary, and I’d love to engage in a discussion on it.
Why RWAs in DeFi?
Most of our DeFi applications are currently based on digital assets, which, while innovative, limit our scope. Imagine the possibilities if DeFi could tap into the vast market of real-world assets. Well, by bridging the gap between traditional finance and DeFi, we can expand the ecosystem beyond digital currencies and tokens.
Potential Benefits:
1. Diversification: Incorporating RWAs could diversify risks and investment options in DeFi.
2. Stability: Real-world assets, being less volatile, could bring much-needed stability to the DeFi space.
3. Inclusivity: This could be a step towards making DeFi more accessible and understandable to traditional investors.
Even though there are several benefits, still there are some challenges that linger around whenever we talk about integrating RWAs in DeFi.
1. How do we ensure the seamless integration of RWAs while maintaining the decentralized ethos of DeFi?
Well, to integrate RWAs into DeFi while preserving decentralization, focusing on utilizing blockchain technology for asset tokenization can ensure transparency and immutability. Employing smart contracts for managing these assets can ensure automation and adherence to the decentralized principles of DeFi. Additionally, one can also leverage decentralized governance systems, like DAOs, for decision-making, maintaining a community-driven approach in managing and integrating RWAs.
2. Regulatory compliance is another area that needs attention.
One can implement KYC and AML protocols while maintaining user privacy, which is crucial. Engage proactively with regulators to shape a conducive regulatory environment and conduct regular compliance audits. Balancing innovation with compliance will be key in integrating RWAs into DeFi sustainably.
By adopting these strategies, we can establish a secure DeFi ecosystem where integrating Real-World Assets becomes a more straightforward and efficient process. Do you think this is the next big step for Decentralized Finance, or are we looking at an incompatible mix?
Looking forward to an engaging discussion!",1
20474,cp0x,2024-01-08 19:10:02,"Yes, recently I also talked about this due to the fact that at the forum there was a proposal to diversify the DAO treasury in the RWA.
I remember how the founder of Ethena (Guy Young) talked about this in the spirit of why he did not pursue this direction in his business. The main idea was that the government will let you do this as long as it a lot of money.
They can simply prohibit to use RWA, usually states don’t like it when their debts go to someone unknown )",2
20474,Jl_DefiEdge,2024-01-17 12:57:41,"The concept of integrating Real-World Assets (RWAs) into DeFi is truly revolutionary. The advantages of diversification, stability, and inclusivity carry substantial importance. The outlined approaches, such as leveraging blockchain for transparency and employing smart contracts for automation, provide pragmatic solutions to uphold decentralization. Ensuring regulatory compliance is a vital consideration, and the method of actively involving regulators and incorporating KYC/AML while safeguarding user privacy represents a well-balanced and essential move. Exciting times ahead for DeFi!",3
20474,Web3Wanderer,2024-01-17 13:19:52,"@cp0x Absolutely, your observations about the diversification of DAO treasuries into real-world assets (RWA) bring up a crucial point. It’s interesting to note Guy Young’s perspective on this, especially considering the complexities involved in blending traditional finance with decentralized models. His caution regarding government regulations and the control of debt distribution is quite insightful. It’s indeed true that governments may be hesitant about decentralized entities holding significant debts, as this can introduce unfamiliar risks and challenges to traditional financial systems.
That being said, the exploration of such innovative approaches is what drives the evolution of finance and governance. While there are regulatory hurdles and uncertainties, the potential for DAOs to diversify into RWAs represents an amazing step towards a more integrated and versatile financial ecosystem. This kind of forward-thinking, despite the challenges, is what fosters progress and adaptation in our rapidly changing world.",4
20474,cp0x,2024-01-17 13:30:14,"@Web3Wanderer
I agree that you should try, you just need to keep in mind that the results of working with RWA are not so scalable.",5

20825,karelvuong,2024-01-23 19:16:49,"Repost of a thread I originally shared on Twitter/X. Sharing on the Arbitrum forums as keen to hear some more perspectives!

Convince me otherwise: builders start off highly incentivized to participate in ecosystems and their governance systems (Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.) but over time see their ability to do so diminish over time.
Builders are initially deeply incentivized to build within ecosystems to establish themselves, drive app demand and activity and, at times, launch entire new categories. Participating at this stage = simply building (ie. what you do best) and you’re typically rewarded early on, enabling you to participate in the next stage of an ecosystem’s progression – through governance.
Over time within ecosystems that are DAOs or have some form of governance, builders naturally become disincentivized to participating in governance. After all, we’re in the business of building – not governing, building frameworks, drafting and iterating on proposals, hopping on governance calls, discussing in delegate chats or governance forums, etc. We are (or should be) more focused on finding PMF, shipping product, managing and aligning teams, marketing, fundraising, partnerships, monetizing, and driving towards key metrics (user growth, activity, TVL, retention, etc). Some builders do find a way to meaningfully participate or adjust their organization to accommodate this paradigm shift but it’s still an uphill battle and investment (that might not see any ROI). Time is a precious, finite resource and builders have their own set of objectives and constituents to serve – all of which are situated within said ecosystem. What starts as one full-time job (typically already more than that) turns into two or more.
At the same time, ecosystems need to grow and what’s a clearer (easier?) metric of growth than acquiring net new builders? This leads ecosystems to tend towards incentivizing newcomers versus supporting existing builders who make the ecosystem. Big, bold, and concerted bets don’t tend to be made in these ecosystems for fear of kingmaking (valid concerns). So incentives are broadly spread to be fair and inclusive, and it generally favours those who are able to spend their time participating in governance or marketing themselves and not those silently building or delivering results. Applying a venture comparison, the result = ecosystems end up indexing on a great deal of 0-1x opportunities and shying away from those that they could meaningfully support to become 10-100x (which feed back into the ecosystem’s flywheel).
So established builders end up facing the following dynamics:
•  Balancing a need to spend time building vs. participating in governance. If you want to have a voice, you’re fighting an uphill battle amidst a growing base of governooooors able to spend much more time than you can within governance. Your fate/position within the ecosystem becomes increasingly being determined by others unless you invest time and capital in this effort. If you stop paying attention for a bit, you’ve got to figure out how to navigate a web of new participants, programs, structures, and processes. Within DAOs, you also have the occasional academic/theoretical pontification that occurs which, put frankly, not all builders have the time for.
•  With crypto moving at a breakneck pace, new projects often take the limelight. And shiny ones who capture metas/narratives are the flavour of the day/week. Existing builders who drive outsized impact and results are left backstage, standing by to see if anyone recalls what they do / have done for ecosystems.
•  Attempting to advocate for oneself often interpreted as self-interest and concerns of kingmaking / monopolies arise. Combatting these perspectives take, you guessed it, more time.
•  Conversely, not participating also puts you in a negative light as well. Established builders who find themselves with governance power are thrust into assuming this role and are subject to high expectations from the ecosystem to actively participate. “Not active in governance? Well you don’t deserve to be here!”
This is a long winded way of me (i) sharing the builder’s dilemma that many of us face relating to the ecosystems that we are actively building within; and (ii) attempting to gather perspectives from others. Decentralized ecosystems and governance are still a grand experiment being figured out, each with their own flavours and culture. As this happens, I implore those attempting to shape and structure governance systems from the ground up to put yourselves in the shoes of the builders and support them throughout their journey.
At the end of the day, the thing we want to do most is build while being recognized for our contributions. In the wise (paraphrased) words of Dory: “Just keep building, just keep building…”

get align data by showing examples of the proposals you like and didn’t, and also writing a description of preferences ⁠
When a proposal comes up, the proposal gets sent to the LLM
LLM decides if it is simple enough and low-risk enough to vote on
LLM makes a decision and describes the decision process, notifies the delegators and a day later submits the vote.

20751,danielo,2024-01-19 22:18:48,"A very interesting tokenomics primitive is Augmented Bonding Curves (ABC). These are essentially two-way vending machines for tokens.
Deposit a token as collateral (eth/stable/etc) and get freshly minted ARB. Or deposit your ARB and get the collateral back (eth/stable/etc). The exchange rate between the tokens (ARB - collateral) is determined by a bonding curve (algorithm) that can be programmed and/or governed by a smart contract (DAO, multisig, etc).
As the price in the open market fluctuates and as people buy and sell tokens to the ABC, an arbitrage opportunity is created between CEXs, DEXs and the ABC. This naturally results in trading (by bots) and this arbitrage trading reduces the price gap.
The ABC can then be programmed to take a small fee out of each transaction, which turns it into a revenue-generating mechanism, and said revenue could be used to further fund the DAO in addition to sequencer fees.
As such, the advantages are:

added liquidity (the ABC serves as a liquidity, providing mechanism)
smoother curves in the price fluctuation of ARB which enhance it’s value as currency (slightly more stable and so people are less likely to dump ARB for stables)
revenue for the DAO

The negative

the ABC needs to be configured well so the price of ARB doesn’t go down (if the curve is too flat, people just keep minting more and more ARB thus reducing it’s holding value. But if the curve is steep enough, then there’s more arbitration trading and more revenue for the DAO, thus increasing assets under management of the DAO and hence collateral backing ARB).

The Treasury & Sustainability Working Group was initiated within the scope of the Plurality Labs grants. Its primary aim is to explore optimal practices for addressing treasury management challenges and recommend which practices, tools, or service providers the DAO should adopt.
karpatkey was awarded a grant by Arbitrum’s Treasury and Sustainability Working Group to conduct research focused on three key areas:

Assessment of ARB Price Impact: Understanding how ARB sales might influence current market dynamics and recommendations to reduce the price impact on ARB.
Sequencer Revenue Utilisation: Exploring the use of sequencer revenues, evaluating their prospective allocation and efficiency in advancing the organisation’s objectives.
Developing Guidelines for Effective Treasury Management: Set of principles and strategies for efficient and sustainable treasury management, ensuring the organisation’s long-term financial health.

TL;DR
Background
This section offers details about the Arbitrum DAO and the ARB token, with a particular focus on the initial distribution of the DAO’s funds and their utilisation as of today:

more than 179 million ARB tokens have been designated for various proposals, representing around 5% of the Arbitrum DAO’s initial treasury allocation in ARB.
The average daily allocation by the DAO, considering all active proposals, breaks down as follows:

About 260,826 ARB per day from the token generation until July 31st, 2024, when distribution to all initiatives except for staking will end according to the built calendar.
Around 358,636 ARB per day from when allocations started (August 7th, 2023) to July 31st, 2024.
With an average daily net revenue of 25.89 ETH from the sequencer over the past year, the DAO is only generating about 10% of its current ARB allocations based on the closing prices as of January 9th, 2024.


Based on current trends, the DAO’s expenditure is expected to account for roughly 10 to 15% of the treasury by the end of the ARB vesting period in March 2027. This trajectory suggests that the Arbitrum DAO will maintain a significant margin to allocate additional resources for the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.

ARB Price Impact
This section delves into the matters related to the price impact of ARB sales in the open market, focusing on the circulating supply and liquidity, both on-chain and off-chain. This includes an analysis of trading volumes and market depth.

In the past 30 days, the average daily trading volume was approximately 428.84 million ARB, equivalent to $670.43 million at the current price.
Of this trading volume, 75% occurred on Centralised Exchanges (off-chain CEXs), while the remaining 25% occurred on Decentralised Exchanges (on-chain DEXs).
The current market can absorb approximately $13.5 million in ARB sales daily with a 2% price impact, considering the combined liquidity from both on-chain and off-chain trusted sources.
To reduce the potential market effects of ARB liquidation, several measures can be considered, including but not limited to:

Diversifying the funding currency for initiatives;
Implementing payment streams to regulate the flow of ARB;
Optimising the frameworks for grants and incentives;
Increasing ARB’s on-chain liquidity;
Enhancing ARB’s use cases within the DeFi ecosystem;
Adding more utility features to the ARB token; and
Considering ARB buybacks using the DAO’s revenue.



Sequencer Revenue Allocation
This section examines potential strategies for deploying the net revenue generated by the Arbitrum sequencer, which is currently unutilised and held in the Treasury Timelock.


Since the launch of the sequencer, the Arbitrum DAO has accumulated nearly 14,000 ETH in net revenue, averaging over 700 ETH per month in the past year. However, as of today, the DAO has not actively deployed this substantial revenue.


Exploring how other rollups utilise their sequencer revenue:


Optimism directs its sequencer revenue towards the Retroactive Public Goods Funding program (RPGF). So far, three funding rounds have been exclusively financed with OP tokens. However, at least in part, future rounds are anticipated to incorporate ETH funding.


Optimism’s total on-chain net revenue is around 9,422 ETH as of the time of this writing.


Base, an L2 built on the OP Stack in collaboration with Optimism, contributes 2.5% of total sequencer revenue or 15% of net on-chain revenue (whichever is higher) to the Optimism Collective as part of the collaboration agreement.


Since Base Chain’s launch, the sequencer has accrued 3,493 ETH in net revenue.


Metis is the only rollup with a clear commitment to decentralising its sequencer.


Metis has recently introduced a staking mechanism requiring METIS token stakes for operating a sequencer node, aimed at attracting more sequencers and reducing METIS’s circulating supply.


The Arbitrum community has proposed various uses for the sequencer revenue; however, regulatory and operational considerations are crucial in evaluating these initiatives:

Funding public goods;
Establishing a permanent ecosystem fund;
Returning value to stakeholders;
Creating protocol-owned liquidity; and
Developing a custom Liquid Stake Token (LST).



Proposed utilisation pathways by karpatkey:


Funding Grants for Ecosystem Development: Consider using the ETH from the sequencer to diversify grant funding mechanisms, reducing reliance on ARB tokens and diminishing market selling pressure.


Building DAO Owned Liquidity (DOL) and later transitioning to a Buyback and Make Strategy: Use sequencer-generated ETH and ARB from the treasury to form a liquidity pool position on major DEXs like Balancer or Uniswap, enhancing ARB’s on-chain liquidity and reducing the dependence on centralised, off-chain, CEXs. After reaching a liquidity threshold, transition to a “buyback and make” strategy, repurchasing ARB for ecosystem development and grant funding, benefiting ARB holders through increased buying pressure.


Allocating ETH to a Liquid Staking Protocol (LSP): Engage in staking activities for validation rewards. Options include forming a partnership with a leading LSP, creating a custom staking solution, or launching an Arbitrum-specific LST. An additional option includes providing ARB holders with staking rewards, akin to the approach used in the Golem Foundation’s Octant project, which supports public goods. However, if the DAO considers this route, conducting a thorough legal evaluation is advisable due to the current uncertain legal environment. This precaution is essential as the legal landscape could evolve in ways that might not favour such initiatives in the future.




Guidelines for Effective Treasury Management
This section explores strategic methods to manage the existing treasury effectively, aligning with the DAO’s objectives and goals. Our approach advocates for a top-down strategy anchored by formulating an Investment Policy Statement (IPS).

According to the principles of a robust IPS and the strategic aims outlined in the DAO’s Amended Constitution, the primary goal of the Arbitrum DAO is to ensure the sustainability, viability, growth, and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem through responsible management and strategic resource allocation, guided by the established principles.
This leads to several key guidelines for treasury management:

The treasury should support initiatives that drive growth and the long-term prosperity of Arbitrum products.
Capital preservation is paramount, with the goal of the returns at least covering a significant part of the grants and incentive programs, considering the treasury’s substantial size.
The long-term aim is to generate returns that can perpetually fund all necessary initiatives.
Capital preservation takes precedence over maximising returns.
The investment horizon is long-term, with a conservative approach to risk.
Preference should be given to proven investments and instruments with a solid track record.
Ethereum-aligned investments are favoured.
Investment opportunities on Arbitrum should be prioritised.


Two case studies that illustrate how other prominent DAOs manage their treasury are presented: the ENS Endowment and the Gnosis DAO.

Both DAOs, despite differing objectives, have implemented a trustless, non-custodial tech solution using Zodiac Modules. This allows them to retain custody of funds while granting the designated manager enough flexibility to respond to market shifts and unusual situations, like exploits.
This is facilitated by role-based access permissions for the manager, predetermined and whitelisted by the DAO through voting, allowing only specific actions.


The treasury currently exhibits a significant imbalance, with ARB tokens making up 99.7% of its composition. This heavy reliance on ARB tokens introduces substantial risk due to market volatility, highlighting the need for strategic rebalancing.
Considering these insights, it’s evident that the DAO requires a diversification strategy that balances both risk management and return optimisation.

Return Objective

With the DAO’s commitment of 103,481,000 ARB towards various initiatives, the total amount of Investable Assets — those that could theoretically be diversified for yield generation — is estimated to be in the range of 3.4 to 3.5 billion ARB ($6.2 to $6.4 billion).
To meet the financial demands of its approved ARB distribution initiatives, the DAO’s required rate of return on its investments would vary between 1.19% and 2.54%. This variation depends on whether the Staking Initiative is included in the analysis and whether Sequencer Revenue is considered.

Risk Objective

The DAO must structure its treasury to ensure the sustainability of its expenses from the yields of its assets, even in challenging market conditions marked by significant downturns.

Recommended Assets
Given the DAO’s unique situation and objectives, three assets are recommended for the treasury’s portfolio:

Stablecoins and Real World Assets (RWA), mainly US treasuries with a maximum maturity of one year;
ETH; and
ARB.

Diversification of Investable Assets

To achieve a desired diversification target, measured as the share of ETH vs the share of Stablecoins/RWAs, the DAO would need to allocate between $2.4 billion and $5.3 billion towards yield-generating strategies. This range depends on the inclusion of the Staking initiative in the analysis. A Worst-case Scenario that considers a significant decline in the price of ETH is also presented.
In the optimal scenario where ETH value is stable or rising and conservative expense projections are applied, the DAO would need to allocate about 40% of its treasury to yield-generating assets. It is essential to recognise that these allocation needs will likely change as the DAO and the Arbitrum ecosystem develop and mature over time.

Treasury Management Architecture

Drawing from the experiences of the ENS Endowment and Gnosis DAO, it would be advantageous for the Arbitrum DAO to adopt a trustless, non-custodial, and role-based treasury management approach.
This method offers a balance of agility and flexibility for quick market response while maintaining the security of not relinquishing fund control to any external manager or committee.

We recognize several potential avenues to explore, yet we believe it’s imperative for the Arbitrum DAO to focus on establishing a clear direction and initiating action. In this regard, we recommend that the DAO clearly outlines its long-term goals and the role of the treasury in supporting these objectives.
Furthermore, given that the treasury is currently almost entirely composed of ARB, we believe that the DAO would greatly benefit from developing a strategy for diversification and initiating the first steps promptly. Considering the treasury’s substantial size and the fact that efforts to effectively manage the treasury have recently started, adopting a phased approach would likely be the most effective method.",9

20630,karpatkey,2024-01-18 22:38:08,"Thank you, @ivorano, for your kind comment.
We have indeed explored an ARB buyback and burn strategy. However, it should be noticed that despite the initial supply being capped at 10 billion ARB, the DAO can inflate the token by a maximum of 2% annually. This means that a buyback and burn approach might not effectively lead to deflationary pressure. In this context, a buyback and make program seems more viable. Once a liquidity threshold is met, the DAO could repurchase ARB from the open market and funnel it back into the treasury, thereby continuously funding the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Considering that Arbitrum is in its growth stage, investing resources to attract new users and enhance activity on its blockchains is crucial.
Another important aspect is decentralisation. While token burning reduces circulating supply, it does not augment the system’s overall value. This could inadvertently centralise power by redistributing current value among a smaller group. Therefore, it’s vital for Arbitrum to prioritise driving authentic growth, securing widespread adoption, and finding a strong product-market fit.",12
20630,Ivorano,2024-01-19 08:07:44,"Hi @karpatkey, thanks for sharing your perspective on the topic.
I also believe that we should anticipate the DAO finding effective ways to deploy capital instead of just burning it. However, I noticed in your report that you mentioned there is considerable room in the treasury for funding growth. You projected the DAO’s spending between 10% to 15% by March 2027. If we also add the funds from the sequencer to the treasury, do you see that level of spending as achievable?
I’m asking because I personally think the implementation of EIP-1559 was a positive step for Ethereum, and it seems to me that we could draw some parallels for sequencer revenue here. Perhaps it would make sense at some future point to assess if the DAO can distribute the expected amounts, and if that’s not the case, maybe it’s time to consider implementing some burn mechanism.",13

If we draw a parallel with startup world, it’ll take us 20 years to fully deploy our treasury! Since power law returns haven’t yet kicked in for any L2, we should be more aggressive at the point of time we’re in.
Would it be an incorrect conclusion to draw from your report, that rather than focus on sustainability we should focus on ramping up expenditures (but doing so wisely). Since diversification is organically happening by growth of sequencer revenue on the one hand and reduction of ARB holdings through grants on the other.",14

 thedevanshmehta:

When looking at Arbitrum, it’s important not to view it solely through a traditional web2 perspective. Startups are high-stakes environments where the goal is often rapid, short-term growth. Arbitrum’s situation may not fit this mould, so we need to tailor the strategy to reflect that.
Too much money could be counterproductive - it creates an obligation to deploy capital at all costs - which commonly reduces investment requirements and consequently their effectiveness as measured by ROI. On the other hand, big treasuries can become a distraction and often end up disincentivizing execution by causing core teams to lose track of the market and general hustle mentality.
It’s crucial to have clear, agreed-upon goals for every initiative even before the planning phase. For treasury management, this might mean creating an Investment Policy Statement; for grants, a specific list of objectives and KPIs. The DAO hasn’t yet established a solid framework for resource allocation, so until then, the focus should be more on ‘investing’ rather than just ‘spending’.
In conclusion, while the DAO is still in a growth phase and sustainability isn’t the immediate priority, we need effective frameworks. These should help identify needs, set priorities, establish goals and KPIs, allocate resources efficiently, measure results, and provide feedback.",15

20521,ajitg,2024-01-10 14:35:09,"Hello Arbitrum Community,
We’ve been focused on developing an efficient decentralized algorithmic stablecoin using WBTC as collateral. Our prototype, created for EthIndia 2023 in December, earned us multiple pool prizes. Now, we’re eager to further advance our project and launch the protocol on Arbitrum. We are looking for mentors who can give feedback and support us in the journey.
Idea Brief:
We’re introducing a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin, featuring hard floor price and negative interest rates, using Bitcoin as collateral.
Summary:
Our decentralized protocol enables Bitcoin holders to maximize liquidity against their collateral. Borrowing will incur an interest which should be paid over time. By locking WBTC in a smart contract to create a “Vault,” users can instantly mint pUSD, a USD-pegged stablecoin. Each vault must maintain a minimum collateralization of 110%. Stability relies on user-driven economic interactions and arbitrage rather than active governance or monetary interventions.
pUSD holders can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying collateral at any time. Collateral from all positions is proportionally burnt to redeem pUSD and get WBTC. Each time a redemption occurs, the MCR gradually increases by a small percentage. This strengthens the $1 floor but also makes it easy to stay above $1 in sticky markets. To counter this, our algorithm continuously reduces the MCR, with a cap at 110%. This approach provides more flexibility to those who minted in the 120+% range, effectively acting as a negative interest rate and re-pegging the price by increasing supply. The redemption mechanism and MCR adjustments will guarantee a stable coin value of at least $1.
pUSD can be staked in the “Stability Pool,” serving as the primary defense for system solvency. Positions falling below the MCR are liquidated using pUSD from this pool. LPs in the stability pool lose a pro-rata share of their deposits but gain a pro-rata share of the liquidated collateral. Since vaults are typically liquidated at current MCR, which is above 110%, LPs receive more collateral in dollar-value relative to the debt they cover.
The protocol incorporates a soft liquidation mechanism through a risk-free Bitcoin pool. This pool is used to mark under-collateralized CDPs as ‘soft-liquidated,’ initiating a timer.

Scenario A: If a CDP re-attains sufficient collateralization due to a Bitcoin price increase before the timer expires, it’s unmarked, with a small percentage of collateral awarded to the pool as a protection fee.
Scenario B: If the owner repays the debt or adds sufficient collateral before the timer expires, the CDP is unmarked, and a small percentage of collateral is allocated to the pool as a protection fee.
Scenario C: If the timer expires without adequate collateralization, the stability pool liquidates the position, and the Bitcoin pool claims a share.

In short, the protocol offers USD borrowing at a low MCR overall, without losing stability.
This concept was meticulously devised after analyzing Liquity and other algorithmic stable coins, integrating their best features while addressing their shortcomings to build a robust system for a decentralized algorithmic stable coin.
We welcome critical feedback from experts and are happy to answer any questions.
Thank you for your attention and support.",1

Tell me, what will happen to the pUSD rate if the Bitcoin rate falls sharply by 20-30%?
Your strategy is good on a bull run, but I don’t see how it will work if the market goes down.

20521,L0tus,2024-01-17 18:29:17,"This proposal is impressive and well-thought-out. The integration of WBTC as collateral, the creation of a “Vault” for instant minting of pUSD, and the unique stability mechanism offer a comprehensive solution. The consideration of negative interest rates and the continuous adjustment of the Minimum Collateralization Ratio (MCR) add flexibility and make the stablecoin more resilient.
The incorporation of a Stability Pool and a risk-free Bitcoin pool for soft liquidation scenarios demonstrates a thoughtful risk management strategy.
Personally, it looks like a promising project with a well-designed protocol, and I’m excited to see how it develops.",6

20662,Avantgarde,2024-01-16 07:57:58,"We are happy to share a study for the Arbitrum community on the impact of portfolio volatility on DAO treasuries.
Following discussions with the Treasury and Sustainability Working Group, our study focuses on the risk reduction properties of traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds for a DAO treasury, and highlights the potential impact on portfolio level risk/reward of broadening an investment universe with less correlated assets. In addition, we also provide examples of how allocations could have affected the historical risk profile of a DAO treasury, and also the tradeoffs of using stablecoins as a risk reduction tool, including the potential impact of capacity constraints for large DAO treasuries looking to earn yield on their stables in DeFi.
The data shared in our study includes:

Levels of portfolio concentration within the DAO treasury landscape
Statistical relationships between ARB, BTC, and ETH
Historical volatility of traditional asset classes compared with crypto
How allocations have impacted historical losses
The cross-section of drawdowns experienced across the DAO landscape post FTX
The relationship between time horizon and expected maximum drawdown
Long term historical evidence for returns in traditional asset classes
Correlations between traditional asset classes and crypto
Potential tail risks when using stablecoins as a risk-free proxy
Capacity constraints for earning yield on stablecoins in DeFi
Optimal portfolios including and excluding traditional asset classes
How constraints around portfolio concentration can limit diversification benefits

We hope that by collating and sharing this publicly available data, we can help to demystify and to highlight the ways these important factors relate to the improvement of long term treasury sustainability.
Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability Research - Demystifying DAO Treasury Risk Reduction",1
20662,thedevanshmehta,2024-01-18 10:01:54,"I see lots of synergies between this & the @Aera research report targeting portfolio volatility in a DAO treasury. Whereas Aera suggests rebalancing according to an assets previous day volatility, Avant Garde makes a compelling case for DAOs move outside web3 into real world assets. On the face of it, I see these 2 approaches being incompatible with one another due to entry and exit fees in real world assets preventing the dynamic rebalancing Aera recommends. These differing approaches assume significance in light of the STEP diversification proposal, as yield bearing stablecoins are compatible with an Aera volatility rebalancing vault whereas whitelisted, tokenized representation of t-bills in our treasury are a more conservative and secure approach that cannot be dynamically rebalanced due to entry and exit feees.
Let’s now look at the substance of their reports & their recommendations
A. Their study of the 25 largest onchain DAO treasuries show 60% hold 90% of assets in their native token. So we are certainly no exception in this regard!
Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 1.48.17 PM1192×812 71.5 KB
The issues with this are (1) inability of our treasury to act as a countercyclical buffer and (2) higher volatility creating a mismatch between assets and liabilities, resulting in higher crystallized losses and greater net outflows
B. Their specific analysis on ARB showed it had a 1.3 to 1.4 beta on BTC and Eth. However, there is not enough history on ARB so we should treat these numbers with caution.
Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 2.29.18 PM1084×754 185 KB
For the rest of their analysis, they use ETH/BTC as a proxy for ARB when comparing performance and volatility with traditional assets.
C. During the most turbulent crypto periods, the difference in volatility widens from 3x to 20x equities and 40x bonds.
Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 2.32.09 PM1190×800 62.6 KB
For example in Q4 2022 a third of DAOs saw peak to trough declines of greater than 50%, with 15% seeing their treasury values collapse 90%!
Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 2.32.25 PM1192×842 91.2 KB
Any liabilities incurred during these bad periods cost the DAO much more than if they had a diversified treasury where we could liquidate traditional assets
Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 2.40.08 PM1202×856 53.2 KB
D. So now the question turns to, what traditional assets should we hold in the first place? Historically, the answer is equities outperform bonds which outperform bills
Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 2.36.23 PM1180×810 61.6 KB
Interestingly, t-bills are actually flat or negative after inflation adjustment, indicating these assets should be the first to get liquidated during a downturn to pay for expenses.
E. But what about stablecoins, I hear you ask?
Even if we leave aside de-peg risks , USDC DAI and Tether don’t have endogenous yield unlike t-bills or bonds. Additionally, de-fi yields on these assets are more volatile and suffer from capacity constrains when done on Arbitrum.
Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 2.41.30 PM1198×808 103 KB
A 5 million DAI deposit on Aave on Arbitrum pushes yield from 9% to 5%, while 25 million DAI takes it below 2%. Even for USDC, 50 million halves the yield on Aave from 12%-6%. Their analysis raises an interesting point on whether ArbitrumDAO should ever put its own treasury to work on Aave and swing the market to this extent.
Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 2.41.36 PM1174×840 108 KB
On Mainnet, a 50 million allocation is less than 1% yield reduction, but its an open question over whetehr we want to stake our assets on ethereum rather than arbitrum.

To conclude, a DAO portfolio that includes traditional asset classes improves risk/reward compared to one that has only ETH & Stablecoins

20571,animal,2024-01-12 14:00:37,"I object to the proposal outlined in RFP-18: Strategic Application of $ARB Allocation from Radiant DAO Treasury. My disagreement stems from several concerns regarding the suggested strategic allocation plan.
Firstly, the proposal suggests allocating a substantial portion of the $ARB tokens to new 6-month and 1-year dLP lockers, favoring those who join the community later. This contradicts the principle of recognizing and rewarding early supporters. Instead, the DAO should prioritize those who have demonstrated sustained commitment from the beginning.
Secondly, the allocation to Starfleet Season 1, particularly the proposed airdrop of up to 40% of $ARB tokens, seems disproportionate. While encouraging growth and engagement is crucial, such a large allocation may dilute the value for existing holders and fail to adequately reward long-term contributors.
Additionally, the proposal mentions the establishment of a leaderboard mechanism, Starfleet, which encountered issues due to an “early-exit loophole.” While I appreciate efforts to rectify this through RFP-17, the reliance on airdrops as a solution raises questions about the overall effectiveness and sustainability of the incentive structure.
Furthermore, the distribution of 30% of $ARB tokens to all Arbitrum dLP lockers over the next year, based on locking length, appears to be a more balanced approach. However, the allocation’s success depends on clear communication and implementation to ensure fairness and transparency.
Lastly, the proposal reserves 30% of the $ARB tokens for future use, providing flexibility for the DAO. While strategic reserves are prudent, a more detailed plan regarding how these reserves will be utilized would strengthen the proposal.
In conclusion, I recommend a reevaluation of the proposed allocation plan, placing greater emphasis on recognizing early supporters and ensuring a balanced distribution that encourages sustained community involvement. This way, the Radiant DAO can build a dynamic and prosperous community without compromising the interests of its existing supporters.
Certainly! Here are some potential solutions to consider in addressing the concerns raised in the proposal:

Early Supporter Recognition:


Introduce a tiered system that rewards early supporters with additional benefits, acknowledging their commitment to the community.


Proportional Allocation for Starfleet:


Adjust the allocation for Starfleet Season 1 to ensure a more balanced distribution that doesn’t disproportionately favor new participants, perhaps by lowering the percentage allocated for the airdrop.


Improved Communication and Transparency:


Enhance communication about the allocation plan to ensure clarity on the rationale and potential impacts. Provide a detailed breakdown of how each allocation contributes to the community’s growth.


Refinement of Starfleet Mechanism:


Evaluate and refine the Starfleet mechanism to address concerns related to the “early-exit loophole.” Consider alternative incentive structures that align with the community’s values and objectives.


Community Feedback Mechanism:


Implement a feedback mechanism within the DAO for community members to express their opinions on proposed allocations and governance decisions. This could involve regular surveys or a dedicated forum for discussions.


Gradual Distribution for Long-Term Incentives:


Consider a gradual distribution model for the 30% of $ARB tokens allocated for long-term incentives. This could involve periodic releases based on milestones, ensuring sustained community engagement.


Clear Plan for Strategic Reserves:


Develop a clear and transparent plan for utilizing the 30% of $ARB tokens reserved for future use. This could involve periodic updates to the community on potential use cases or strategic initiatives.


Incentives for Token Locking Renewals:


Encourage existing dLP lockers to renew their token locks by introducing additional incentives or rewards. This can contribute to the continuity of community involvement.


Governance Proposal for Adjustments:


Establish a governance proposal mechanism that allows community members to suggest adjustments to allocation plans. This fosters a democratic process and ensures that community voices are heard.


Educational Initiatives:


Implement educational initiatives to help community members understand the rationale behind allocation decisions, fostering a better-informed and supportive community.

For instance, constructing weather derivatives might face initial skepticism but could gain momentum due to heightened awareness of climate change, attracting interest. The tokens issued by such projects will remain native when backed by the DAO from the outset.
Similarly, the DAO can and should explore ambitious projects, providing a platform for native builders to experiment with.",3
20298,Ken_x3,2023-12-30 15:50:21,"Interesting overarching sentiment, @Blueweb:

We must offer assistance to a team striving to create something with minimal odds of success but permitted to persevere in its development.

In my opinion, this is a huge challenge for builders in the space but moreso the incentive structure around protocol innovation feels to be completely backwards. It is far easier for a developer, venture studio, or VC-backed entity to fork and deploy on new chains as opposed to spending 12-18 months focusing on innovation. This is actually one of my biggest concerns of where the space is heading as quite frankly the application layer isn’t developing quick enough as it stands.
You see a handful of mavericks taking on the challenge of protocol innovation, but it feels sparse at best. Perhaps Arbitrum is well-placed to support a shift within these misaligned incentives to support those exploring the potential of the underlying blockchain/rollup.
Some further musings on my side: Beyond a traditional incubator model, the opportunity seems to be in supporting these concept/pre-seed/seed stage projects by leveraging the USPs of the DAO. For example, a Web3 incubator could embrace:

Open/flexible contribution from Web3-native talent.
Arbitrum or protocol tokenomics to create longer term synergies.
Rapid GTM testing via user incentives from the DAO treasury.

This approach would give early-stage projects an edge, and at the same time create early-stage stickiness to the chain through support with human resources and intertwined tokenomics. Perhaps this would lead to an increase in native assets within the Arbitrum ecosystem?
As a starting point you could audit attempts from other ecosystems (Parachains for example) and understand what did and importantly what didn’t work, align Arbitrum DAO stakeholders and form a strategy for said challenge.",4
20298,DisruptionJoe,2024-01-04 03:38:46,"To align incentives, would some combination of upfront payment plus ARB with some amount of linear vesting be a better way to allocate these grants?",5
20405,Augustus,2024-01-03 16:54:53,"GM. I am just trying to get ahead of this conversation to improve the likes of the Arbiturm Ecosystem as it expands.
BUY BACKS
Under no circumstances should Arbitrum institute a buy back program to improve the price of ARB. This might sound good but it presents a permanent sell pressure on Ethereum which is the underlying asset of all of Arbitrum Defi. Furthermore, there is no small amount of Ethereum that this is okay with.
I do not agree with this but if you must earn some money on the ether that is earned from sequencers stake it to the beacon chain. This must not be liquid staked with any other entity and if it is liquid staked, this token should only be available on Arbitrum and Arbitrum Orbits as Arbitrum Staked Ether. A certain percentage of the revenue, maybe some 40% could be staked. The supply only grows from the sequencer revenue and should never be open to user deposits. Similarly, the Arbitrum Ether Contract (0x8315177aB297bA92A06054cE80a67Ed4DBd7ed3a) should never be used to stake.
Unclaimed Airdrop
It is a no brainer that the Unclaimed ~ 69,000,000 Arbitrum Tokens should be airdropped to the users of the blockchain. There should be a transaction minimum for the airdrop. If a user has only 10 arbitrum transactions, since the airdrop, I don’t see the need of airdropping to them. The qualifications should be up to date but users should be the target rather than those who received the initial drop.
I think there should be a matched ~69,000,000 Arbitrum Tokens to native projects to further boost activity with app specific user drops. Large prjects like Uniswap and AAVE are also worth boosting as well. I’d also like to see some boosting of NFT activity, although I am unsure how that might be accomplished. There should be some bridging incentives as well.
Orbit Funding
I once had a funny dream that there should be a way to extract a rent from Layer 3s. These applications will likely have amazingly low gas fees and their centralization will likely offer a way to have gas fees paid to Arbitrum in Arbitrum Tokens. However, I would be against this if this proposed some form of forced ether selling.
I imagine that Layer 3s have a significant detachment to the laws set for all Layer 2s by the Ethereum Settlement & Execution Environments. Further Experimentation should be done here.
Gasless Day
Lastly, I think Arbitrum should experiment with a gasless day. I imagine it’ll be expensive but I think we should figure out what that might look like. I saw that Arbitrum Burned some 122 Ether in the last 24 hours with some 200k USD in fees. It’ll be expensive. Maybe we’ll spend 1,000,000 USD in Ether but it is an experience worth offering. It may be worth offering this after EIP-4844, but the logistics should be in place.
If EIP-4844 has been implemented and Arbitrum has been updated by Arbitrum day (23 Mar 2024) then I propose that be our first annual gasless day on Arbitrum. If it hasn’t been implemented, I still think it is a worthy pursuit.
Expenses
While I am heavily in favour of using the Treasury the DAO has to onboard and reward users, I would like to state that I have significant appreciation for the conservative approach Arbitrum DAO has taken thus far. I will promote whatever is best for the ecosystem, however, I do not want to spray Arbitrum tokens everywhere without purpose. As we speak, it is mooning because of the conservatism the DAO has.",1

Priorities for Milestone 2

Work We Will Facilitate

Experiments We Will Conduct

PROBLEM:
Frameworks should aid in our ability to find talent, double down on winners, and cut what isn’t working. There is a fundamental mismatch between the risk taking innovation needed to build capture-resistance and the community led governance of a DAO.
For example, watch 20 seconds of this discussion where they discuss Elon Musk’s ability to blow up rockets vs Nasa.
To build capture-resistant governance we need the ability to run experiments. The DAO has made it known that it prefers frameworks for hiring service providers. This is one of the most likely areas for capture. The issue is that different work requires different types of funding mechanisms. The desire to bucket service providers as one type of funding may seem natural, but it is not the optimal variable to use to determine how we fund the work.
Here are just a few other variables that could influence which funding mechanism is best

Latency of work - How long does it take to see results (research vs discord post)
Broad scope vs narrow scope
Difficult to source or difficult to find excellence
High expertise vs low expertise

There is little difference between resource allocation to service providers, DAO contributors or employees, Firestarters, and other forms of grants or payments. In DAOs, we tend to call any allocation of resource “grants”. In the real world, the term grant generally refers to the type of funding that discounts the requirement for impact. It is generally used to fund innovation that cannot be funded in Milestone or KPI driven ways. The terms and altered definitions we use in web 3 make the conversation noisy.
For example, RPGF is a great meme, but there isn’t much new about retroactive funding. There is another type of retroactive funding which evolved before the web 3 culture which is commonly used for milestone/kpi driven work. It is called paychecks. It’s this system where people do work, then retroactively get paid for it based on their employer’s high context impression of their work. However, we haven’t solved how the community led governance might perform as well as an employer or manager yet.
1293×819 89.9 KB
We even have retroactive paycheck funding for public goods. It is called government salaries. If you’ve dealt with a government, you know that they aren’t known for hiring go getters.
Ghostbusters - The Private Sector
So how do we get frameworks in place which double down on winners and cut what isn’t working?
Solution
Tighten up our iterative learning cycles while increasing allocation amounts. This needs to happen under the facilitation of some group with broad and long term context so experiments are iterative and learning is compounded.
We need to increase the amount available for experimental funding because there needs to be enough available to iterate enough times to find the best solutions.
We need to take some big shots as well. Tightening iterative cycles of defining needs, funding work, evaluating results, and sanctioning or boosting based on results lets the process play out faster, meaning we find solutions faster. Our best bet to do this is to involve other experts in the space as grant program managers.
Plurality Labs has started and would love to continue that process. In order to truly test what mechanisms work, we will need to scale the amounts funded by an order of magnitude.
Why?
Because the systems don’t currently exist and/or if they do, we have not found the right combination or stack yet. This is an evolutionary game. We cannot be expected to simply intelligently design the future. We must take shots on goal trying new systems to see what sticks.
Question: How much should we aim to allocate?
Disruption Joe had 17 one hour calls with delegates last week. It seems like Plurality Labs has broad support for moving on to milestone 2. There also has been broad support of our idea to extend milestone 2 to cover all of 2024 as opposed to 6 months).
There isn’t clear support for Plurality Labs to allocate 30 million ARB which we had posted several times during conversations in Milestone 1. Some delegates thought that is too much and some said it makes perfect sense.
For those that said they aren’t sure they would support PL allocating 30 million ARB in 2024, their reasoning can be categorized as:

They need to review our Milestone 1 allocations first
They can review the work here
They would prefer us to have a smaller increase maybe 1.5 or 3 times the size of our first milestone.
People are asking us to fund clear needs right now and we are fully allocated. We are suggesting we could do much more AND that there are things we think should be done that we couldn’t with a significantly smaller amount.
The would prefer us to have a few Tally votes throughout the year.
This does not allow us the same freedom in experimentation. That might be ok, but we don’t think it is optimal for Arbitrum. Remember that these funds go to the PL-ARB Grants Safety multisig which has 4 delegates and 2 PL team members and the DAO can clawback funds at any time.

We hope to find the solution to capture-resistant governance, but if we didn’t, Arbitrum would still end up with a well funded ecosystem.
This conversation is not about Plurality Labs service fee (that is what the proposal will do). For this conversation, let’s discuss allocation amount independently. We are here to solve a problem. A larger allocation amount gives us more shots on goal and the experimentation happens in tandem to quality ecosystem funding.
With 30 million we would be able to:

Increase allocation sizing to high performers
Hire higher quality people to work for workstreams because they can expect there is funding available to keep paying them if they do their job.
Fund the first steps of big bet projects
Allocate funds to “competitor governance design frameworks” in a way that avoids redundancy and allows us to learn what conflicts will happen while being able to coordinate effective resolutions. (One of these could be the funding needed to compliment the Grants DAO legal funding offer from the foundation.)

A Potential Split of Funding

3 million to high context workstreams aligning with delegates on priorities and doing the research to prioritize what we should fund
3 million to high context specialist sharing skills across workstreams (marketing, data, etc)
12 million in funding for the workstreams to allocate throughout the year. Each quarter workstreams suggest “campaigns” that are narrow in scope and have clearly defined outcomes.
6 million in doubling down on successful Plurality Labs milestone 1 programs
6 million in funding new competitive governance (Imagine we select two programs to operate at the level we did in milestone 1)

Think of us as Dad holding the bike seat while you ride. The training wheels are still on. Do you want Dad to see you ride once and then take the training wheels off or do you want him to be confident that you are ready? More funds available means more opportunities for us to truly understand what works.
The DAO should fund multiple grants programs outside of what PL does. We loved seeing the community support STIP and would love to see a gaming STIP! However, tightening iteration cycles and conducting directed experimentation requires programs where PL is in the approver seat.
The more experimentation that is centralized under the PL program, the more learning we can do. Yes, this seems counter-intuitive, but there would still be billions in the treasury which is not centralized in our program.
And again, the experimentation happens at the same time as DAO needs are getting funded. If Arbitrum DAO wants to go heavy on winners, we hope you will allow us to do the most we can to drive this ecosystem forward. You still have our promise to work ourselves out of a job!
Which of the following scenarios would you rather see (assuming the PL fee is acceptable)?

5x increase & 1 year term - A proposal to send 30 million ARB to the PL-ARB Grants Safety multisig which would roll over any funds left at the end of the year. (Lowest PL fee)
5x increase & 6 month terms - A proposal to send 15 million ARB to the PL-ARB Grants Safety multisig with another Tally vote to ask for more after 6 months if it is smart to do so. (Slightly higher PL fee)
1.5x increase to start w/ critical amounts earmarked and ability to “refill” - A proposal to send 10 million ARB with an amount (maybe 3 million ARB) earmarked for workstreams to have a full year of salaries available and PL simply run another Tally vote when more is needed. (Highest PL fee w/ bonus structure at refills)

Which of these seems like the best option?

Here are a few of our top priorities for Milestone 2
The Work We Will Facilitate
All of our work will involve continuous improvement of our ability to sense and respond to enable growth. We’ve baselined our success metrics, but the number one metric of our success is the value of Arbitrum governance. However, we need to connect that value to being a citizen.

SENSE | Improving Communication for Understanding the DAO’s Needs
Problem: It is hard to maintain context and awareness of what is happening in the DAO and how to participate. DAO members don’t have a place to go to find out:

What they need to know to maintain context
What the DAO needs them to do
What opportunities exist for them to offer value

Solution: Provide aggregated communications on ThankARB.com segmented to personas. Reward those who consistently do their “civic duty” with reputation. Use ARB rewards to incentivize weekly check-ins. Increase the number of people with context and ready to mobilize.

Create Segmented User Personas (Delegate/Builder/Grantee/etc)
Aggregate Communications
Build a Weekly Communication Cadence
Measure Weekly Active Users (WAU) & Monthly Active Users (MAU)

RESPOND | Coordinating the DAO’s Response in Allocating Funds
Problem: The proper structures don’t exist to create positive-sum interactions and establish goals with long time horizons. The DAO does not currently have:

A process for hiring
A legal structure for efficient KYC/KYB
A governance structure for driving alignment & prioritizing how we spend
Known next steps or pathways for contributors
Onboarding contributors

Solution: Expand on the success of Firestarters to take the next steps in going from 0-1. Plurality Labs role includes being a facilitator for designing a well functioning DAO.

Design participation pathways. Firestarters to Workstreams to Campaigns
Design legal, technical & governance frameworks (in collaboration with foundation and delegates) that incentivize long term thinking, reduce circles of influence from forming, and provide checks & balances for accountability.
Involve delegates in the formation and testing of structures
By having Plurality Labs facilitating the emergent structure of how workstreams are formed and held accountable, we avoid a coalition taking power and not spreading it.
Ensuring the composability of other DAO grant and procurement structures

GROW | To Grow, We Need Effective Collaboration
Problem: The DAO hasn’t found a way to identify and mobilize expertise when it is needed to ensure positive sum outcomes. Frameworks focus on allowing anyone to participate rather than identifying outliers and continually elevating the performance of the DAO. The DAO is not currently capable of:

Identifying and validating expertise
Providing checks and balances for grant program manager decisions
Reasons for contributors who aren’t delegates to participate
Retaining collective knowledge about grantees & grant programs
The ability to assess impact in credibly neutral ways
Clear definitions of Arbitrum citizens

Solution: Build user profiles over time via a combination of survey techniques, data analysis, and testing to enable the DAO to identify expertise, double down on winners, and cut off poor performance in a credibly neutral and community led way.

Building user profiles over time using implicit and explicit information
Conduct community led review experiments alongside control groups
Identify engaged DAO members willing to provide adequate effort
Identify expertise in reviewing high value contributions
Make reputation data available on an open data substrate allowing open interpretation
Continuously evaluate & Iterate

DAOs are complex by nature, thus they require complexity aware solutions based on a continuous practice of sensing and responding in order to grow. This process is what we will facilitate to ensure the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Priorities for Funding in 2024
In January we will host sessions with delegates to determine our funding priorities for 2024. We learned from the GovMonth experiment that we gathered good info and the community appreciated it, but we need better validation from the delegates as the decider.
This does not mean that the Thank ARB priorities are the overall priorities of the DAO. The delegates will determine the overall priorities and Thank ARB will fund within these priorities as a subset of the total acceptable funding areas. It will allow us to execute experimental funding faster knowing we have alignment.
Potential Big Bets
We think that we can support many of these big bets! For some we could directly fund the ideasand we can also help guide big proposals to figure out how to get the votes needed.

The big bets discovered in the Arbitrum working here
Making Arbitrum a home for builders with an Accelerator framework giving builders a mentor network, services, and a pathway to investment
Figuring out how to continuously fund the DAO operations and maybe even grants on yield and/or revenue

Better Contributor Pathways
Most DAO members we talk to want to be a good Arbitrum citizen. They simply don’t know how. In addition to defining the personas and pathways, we can extend our understanding of users to help the intrinsically motivated remove starting friction.

Onboarding services, dashboard & experiences
Clear onchain structures for different allocation mechanisms
tARB reputation for doing your “civic duty”
Partner with quest providers hired by protocols building on Arbitrum to drive new citizen traffic

Focus Areas for Experimentation in 2024
We aim to conduct experiments in these focus areas that we feel are most likely to yield results.
Heirarchy of Outcomes
A DAO attempts to use technically & politically decentralization to achieve a goal. That goal is the top of a hierarchy of outcomes which the DAO catalyzes. It will change incentives into action and the DAO will grow in the direction of the incentives. Capture-resistance happens when the pie gets bigger with more participants. This is only possible if the participants are incentive aligned.
Pending the delegates’ discussions in January, the Vision, Mission and Strategic Priorities can serve as this high level alignment. This must include a positive feedback loop between the value of ARB governance and the number of active governance participants.
Contributor Pathways
Our Firestarters program was an undeniable success having a hand in sparking STIP, Security Audit Providers RFP process, ARDC, and the Treasury and Sustainability working group. Now what? We need to provide the next steps and long term pathways for contributors to go from zero to 100. And it all needs to be onchain.
High Context Workstreams
Someone needs to maintain context over time. Workstreams can do this for us. There are known issues which need to be addressed such as:

Tendency to bloat or hire more and more
Inability to hold individuals accountable
Lack of continuous feedback and communication
Tendency to become silos of information

Elected Campaigns
Workstreams that don’t bloat would need some funds available to grant to the ecosystem to participate in discovery and building of solutions. Plurality Labs will be there to push the needle towards participatory and community led solutions when possible.
Meta-Allocation Governance
How might we involve the community in allocating how much should be available for each outcome campaign? How much should be available overall? How might we fund the entire DAO using yield from our treasury? How might the DAO agree on ways to allocate governance over the next year or two to intentionally rebalance power to provide truly neutral digital public infrastructure?
Competitive Governance
One of the best ways to spark results is competition. Could we allow a few service providers to construct governance frameworks that can be tested with smaller allocations?
Already Funded Work You Will See In January 2024
Strategic Priorities
When we conducted the #GovMonth experiment to derive a Vision, Mission, Values and Strategic Priorities. We made a mistake. Our process did not include a special consideration of the largest delegates. This is a disservice to the voters they represent. In January we hope to rectify this oversight via a delegate campaign to surface the outcomes they would like to see.
We did use our #GovMonth strategic priorities to guide our funding during milestone 1 along with consistent interaction with delegates during our weekly workshops (but not specific feedback about the derived priorities). These priorities should be regularly checked and updated.
In January, we will conduct a process to identify legitimate strategic priorities with these delegates. Once we are confident in the legitimacy of the strategic priorities, we can then being the process of allocating funding to workstreams and outcome campaigns.
January Project One - Delegates Thank ARB
This campaign will include user research talking to delegates about what information they need and how they need it delivered. Delegates will have the opportunity to be rewarded for their participation in surveys, workshops, and other key value creating activities which will help us reconcile their interests with the #GovMonth results.
January Project Two - Reviewing All Funded Grants
Every ARB that has been spent by the DAO will be reviewed by the community along with two independent control groups. As we identify those who are willing and capable of honestly reviewing grants, it will create more opportunities for the community to be involved. Imagine:

Decentralized and automated milestone payouts
Decentralized review of eligibility and eligibility criteria
Massively increasing the DAO ability to process grant applications
Dashboards allowing anyone to compare grants programs
One place to send someone interested in a grant
Automated process operations for delivering compliant grants
Continuous evaluation of impact relative to intended outcomes

Interesting feedback. I had considered everything that we are discussing here to be part of that discussion. The opening statement to the problem we are discussing is:

The desire to bucket service providers as one type of funding may seem natural, but it is not the optimal variable to use to determine how we fund the work.


Are you looking for exact experiments we will conduct in decentralizing components of the system? We intentionally left this vague at this point. Here is what we intended as stated in the discussion from AIP - 3.



AIP - 3 [Non-Constitutional] Fund the Arbitrum Grants Framework Proposal Milestone 1

Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3
The overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.
Prior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures… The same process will occur before Milestone 3.
Milestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. By the end of Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for the entire process to run autonomously onchain.


We had to work with the foundation to create systems for compliance which ended up with us not being able to fund anything until November, most not until December. This meant that programs intended to start in Oct/Nov had delayed start dates and therefore finish dates.
I understand that it would be better if we had fully completed all programs and had a final review before asking for Milestone 2 funding, but we believe there is enough corpus of work for people to review here to be an intelligent decision about the direction they would like us to go.
Have you ever had someone ask you how much it will cost to do something and they want you to do it for less? This conversation isn’t about the amount Plurality Labs is charging. I’m directly asking delegates to consider allowing us to allocate an amount that I think would best position us for success in finding solutions for capture-resistance.
What would you like to see?



 thedevanshmehta:

After the 1st milestone, what programs if any can be now delegated to the DAO without Plurality Labs managing them? If none, which programs do you foresee the DAO managing by itself at the end of milestone 2?


I’d say none right now which as was the intention of milestone 1. The programs I foresee being managed by the DAO by the end of Milestone 2 is almost all of them. For milestone 3 we would have more of an “admin switch” type of relationship to how we manage the funds, though there may still be some unresolved experimentation.



 thedevanshmehta:

I’ve voted for option 3, a 1.5x increase from milestone 1, on the grounds that more is not always better. As we now know which programs work better than others, I’d like details on what experiments will NOT be repeated in milestone 2 as they were deemed to be a low RoI in milestone 1. I’ve not seen enough reflections on failures from the 1st milestone and how flab will be cut by doubling down on those that worked at the expense of those which were found wanting.


We won’t know which programs we won’t do in milestone 2 until we:

Review grant success/impact. This is happening in January, then will be continuous thereafter.
Review program success. This has to happen after programs end. Any that resolve before Jan 15th will be in our Milestone 1 report  which will be posted in February.
Align strategic priorities with delegates

The point of this post is to gauge if we have earned enough trust from the DAO with the work that has been done so far to ask for the amount that we feel would best empower us to provide capture-resistance and would offer the DAO best results as far as unleashing us to make maximum impact.
We don’t want to post a proposal with an amount that the DAO doesn’t support. We do want to have this conversation to figure out what the best path forward is.",3

 DisruptionJoe:

Have you ever had someone ask you how much it will cost to do something and they want you to do it for less?


I didn’t mean to cost cut for the sake of it, but probe more deeply into whether we’ve done the public exercise of cutting the flab by removing projects and activities deemed to have had relatively less impact.



 DisruptionJoe:

This meant that programs intended to start in Oct/Nov had delayed start dates and therefore finish dates.


But this is important context I missed, as the late start affects timelines for gauging success

Not just me but all the other delegates too appreciate how involved you are with the Arbitrum ecosystem. Your daily involvement with the DAO has put you in an irreplaceable position of connecting capable people in your network with tasks that need to be done for the DAO.
You have earned the trust of the DAO for sure, we are just asking for more involvement into how the number of 30 million ARB came to be, or in your own words



Proposal: Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program

show why they are making the decisions they are in how the proposal is drafted.


Overall, it looks like we have to take a leap of faith with plurality labs for milestone 2; you have earned that in my view, and I’m going to hold you to the committment you are making for milestone 3!

This timeline won’t work. The evaluations of all the grants happens throughout January. The Milestone 1 report will be in February. Many of the programs end in March or April. Any programs done before February will be evaluated in this way. However, the ones that finish after cannot be assessed and our team runs out of paychecks at the end of January.",5

20037,naugustin,2023-12-12 20:43:22,"Dear Arbitrum Community,
TL;DR: Spend 5 minutes on our research https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DAOs, and gain valuable insights into your participation dynamics. Understand the motivations behind contributors’ involvement with Arbitrum (or lack thereof).
I am currently working on a joint research project with Andreas Eckhardt (University of Innsbruck) and Victoria Reibenspiess (Washington State University) focusing on participation dynamics in DAOs. Active and voluntary contributions are crucial success factors for DAOs, and understanding why people participate and what keeps them committed can be immensely advantageous.
Therefore, we are inviting you to participate in our 5-minute survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DAOs
In addition to providing monetary incentives, we offer a “management summary” for each DAO with more than 40 participants in the survey. This summary provides insights into your unique participation structure, offering valuable information to better understand why people participate and remain committed to Arbitrum. It can aid you in developing better strategies tailored to your specific needs.
Your valuable insights would significantly contribute to my PhD research!
Thank you for considering it! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
Best regards,
Nils Augustin (University of Innsbruck)

14637,animal,2023-05-23 17:44:49,"Dear Arbidrum forum members,
I am writing this letter seeking assistance regarding a troubling issue I encountered with my ARB tokens. Recently, I saved up 400 ARB tokens with the intention of unlocking the loan in Radiant. However, to my dismay, the tokens have vanished without a trace. This unexpected loss has brought me dangerously close to liquidation, and I find myself in a state of helplessness. I have reached out to various sources in search of an answer, but regrettably, I have yet to receive a satisfactory explanation.
I want to emphasize that I did not authorize or sign any transaction related to the disappearance of my ARB tokens. Additionally, when I checked my Metamask transaction history, there is no record of any such transaction taking place. This situation has left me utterly perplexed and concerned about the security of my assets.
In my pursuit of answers, I stumbled upon two transactions associated with my account, which I believe might hold some crucial information. The first transaction hash is: [1]. The second transaction hash is: [2]. Upon reviewing these transactions, I noticed that the “Interacted With (To)” field mentions the contract 0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548 (Arbitrum Foundation: ARB Token) [1].
Furthermore, I observed that the second transaction seems to be missing the color from the logo, which raises additional concerns [2]. I am hopeful that someone knowledgeable can shed light on these matters and guide me toward a resolution. I am determined to prevent my account from being liquidated, as I firmly believe in the potential of web 3 technologies. Over the past three years, I have consistently added 100 euros to my balance each month, and yet my current balance is less than 500 euros. This incident has dealt a severe blow to my morale, as it was the first time I felt a sense of affirmation in my decision-making process.
I kindly request your assistance in finding answers to the following questions:

What could be the reason behind the disappearance of my ARB tokens?
How can I retrieve or recover these tokens to avoid liquidation (If can off curse)?
Why does the second transaction lack the logo’s color, and could it be related to the issue at hand?
Why the contract I interact says Arbitrum Foundation? Is it fraud? and if yes can we do something more active to prevent this for happening ?

I sincerely hope that someone within the Arbidrum community can provide valuable insights and support. Your expertise and guidance would be immensely appreciated in helping me safeguard my assets and restore my faith in the platform.
Thank you for your attention and consideration.

From the docs, this consists of 1.162 Billion airdropped to users, and 113 million in grants to DAO’s building apps on Arbitrum.
However -  when looking at the holders of ARB on Arbiscan, the circulating supply appears much higher. The top 100 holders alone, excluding all contract addresses including multisigs, hold around 3.8 billion ARB.

19579,hunt_nft,2023-11-16 07:06:11,"In simple terms, Hunt NFT can do the following:


Participate in raffles for popular NFTs on the Ethereum mainnet while being on the Arbitrum network. Simply purchase bullets to enter the raffle, and your chances of winning is equal to the ratio of the number of bullets you purchase to the total number of bullets available.


You can create raffles for the NFTs you own on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base networks.


If you don’t win the raffle multiple times, you will earn bullet shells. You can use these bullet shells to purchase NFTs in the bullet shell store.


Imagine this:
You are in the jungle, hunting for animals. One particular monkey catches your interest. Armed with a hunting rifle, you take aim and fire three shots. Eventually, you hit the monkey, making it your prized trophy. You still have three bullet shells in your hand.
Now, let’s imagine that instead of a real monkey, it represents NFTs, such as “Bored Apes.” Firing a gun is equivalent to participating in a raffle by purchasing bullets, and the bullet shells you receive are the rewards for your multiple participations. This is Hunt NFT!
Let’s enjoy this Hunt game to the fullest!

Let’s take an example: Eric owns BAYC #1 on the ETH mainnet and wants to use his own BAYC #1 to create an NFT raffle on Hunt NFT. The following events will occur:


Eric approves his BAYC #1 to Hunt NFT.


Eric deposits his BAYC #1 to the SubBridge contract on the ETH mainnet.


The HuntBridge contract on the Arbitrum receives the message and mint hBAYC #1, which is then sent to the huntGame contract to start the raffle.


When a winner claims his prize NFT, the hBAYC #1 is burned. Simultaneously, a message is sent to SubBridge on ETH mainnet, which sends the actual BAYC #1 to the winner’s address.

19306,sam.ng,2023-11-05 17:13:15,"Hey,
It would be cool to delve into the key objectives for the DAO in 2024. One topic I find interesting is the concept of power distribution within the network. Today, “technically”, the Security Council has the power to make an upgrade at any time, has implementing a “High Alert Mode” been considered? This would be triggered in emergencies, such as if the network fails to produce valid blocks for a set period, say “x” hours.
The “High Alert Mode” could be a feature integrated in the L1 contracts, designed for rapid response upgrades. Key points for this feature might include:

The Security Council would only assume its full authority during High Alert Mode.
Activation of this mode would be strictly reactionary, triggered by system failures, and not by direct human intervention. Thus, increasing trust minimization and adding an extra layer against wrench attacks and regulatory changes, while still allowing for an upgrade via multisig - but only under specific conditions.

Another engaging topic is sequencer decentralization. The ARB staking proposal adds some ambiguity here imho. It’s not entirely clear whether new sequencers would be required to stake ARB for participation. Could the DAO vote to elect new sequencers and decide how to distribute sequencer revenues? Such a governance and revenue distribution model seems particularly suitable for Arbitrum (i.e active and opinionated governance) compared to other PoS systems.
Finally, with the launch of Orbit mainnet and the ability to switch the DA layer when deploying your Orbit chain, there’s a lot of potential for new use cases like gaming and socials within the Arbitrum ecosystem (which is gud). However, the trust assumptions required for an optimistic rollup with off-chain DA might risk asset safety for users. To mitigate this, why not introduce more modular options? For instance, given that Orbit chains can leverage Stylus and that RISC Zero is Rust-compatible, developers could have even more possibilities to innovate.
These are some initial thoughts I hope can be explored at the Arbitrum DAO Sessions.",8

12560,Mickeymrdt,2023-03-30 06:53:51,"Hello Arbinauts, We love to share experience in indonesia.
Arbitrum is one of the blockchain platforms that has recently gained popularity in Indonesia. The platform offers high-scale solutions and lower transaction costs compared to other blockchain platforms. Therefore, many blockchain communities in Indonesia are interested in participating in this platform.
In recent months, the blockchain community in Indonesia has taken the initiative to form communities to learn and promote the use of Arbitrum. They have conducted various activities such as webinars, online discussions, and meetups to share knowledge about the platform. Additionally, they often perform airdrops, which are giving tokens for free to community members as a form of appreciation and support.
The airdrops provided by the Indonesian community have successfully attracted many people to use the Arbitrum platform. With the free tokens provided, many people become interested in learning and trying to use this platform. Many of them then started to develop applications and smart contracts on the Arbitrum platform.
The Indonesian community not only provides free tokens to members but also provides guidance and support to develop applications and smart contracts. With this support, many community members have successfully developed interesting and useful applications and smart contracts.

2023-03-30 13.45.11720×1280 107 KB

Currently, the blockchain community in Indonesia that is active in the development and use of the Arbitrum platform continues to grow. They have the same vision to promote the use of blockchain and related technologies in Indonesia. It is hoped that more people will be interested in joining this community and utilizing the Arbitrum platform for the development of innovative and useful blockchain applications and solutions.

19130,DisruptionJoe,2023-10-24 18:00:09,"ThankARB: A Strategy, Framework, & Platform for Arbitrum’s Success
Coherence, Coordination & Competency via Community
We completed a participatory design process open to all 600,000 token holders to align on Vision, Mission, Values, and Strategic Priorities. Now What?
Plurality Labs  Gov Month 20231414×2000 296 KB
This post is designed as a compliment to the “executive level” strategic framework decided upon by the community. (Review the GovMonth report here to see how it was made.) Priorities are a starting place, but real strategy involves more than just a view of where we are going. It cuts through the fog to create clear lines of sight. It clarifies where we have leverage to create the change we want to see.
ThankARB Strategy
Strategic priorities are abstract visions of where we want to go. They are inspirational. Consensus creates buy-in as diverse perspectives can all see their importance.
A strategy is a deep understanding of why we are choosing a specific path to get there. It is operational. It is saying, “this is specifically where we will focus our resources and why”.
The ThankARB strategy will:

Guide the design of the grant framework by Plurality Labs
Assist in coordination amongst other interested parties
Offer direction for other interested parties such as voting delegates and future grantees
Be updated to reflect the conversation with the DAO on the ThankARB platform
Continue to be based on our understanding of Aribitrum’s DAO, ecosystem, industry, and external market factors.

The ThankARB strategy will not:

Be the only strategy adopted by the DAO
Be enforced as a rule similar to the constitution
Be exclusively available to Pllurality Labs granted programs

What we are presenting is neither a ruleset which must be enforced or an exclusion of other potential strategies. It is a clear declaration of the way Plurality Labs intends to grant funding assisted by the ThankARB platform. It is also an invitation for others to opt-in to a framework which provides coherence, coordination and competency to a community-driven ecosystem.
The strategy realizes that our greatest asset is our community. Afterall, this is why Arbitrum has a DAO. It is also why our strategy is only imposed on OUR own actions and for those who self-regulate to work within our framework. Such individuals can be grantees aligning their actions. It can mean other grant programs approved by the DAO. It can mean the foundation and its key service providers having clear insight into the intentions of the DAO, thus being able to strategically compliment our efforts.
ThankARB is our strategy at Plurality Labs and we invite you to join us.
ThankARB Strategy Framework
The strategy we are presenting has three components which combine to form the “kernel”. The kernel reduces infinite complexity in how we will achieve our goals. It is composed of three parts: a Strategic Diagnosis, a 4C Strategy Policy , and Strategic Actions.
Strategic Diagnosis
These are the three items we see as the critical issues and leverage points around which a strategy can be designed.
Current Lead in Markets & Tech
Arbitrum has a nice green and yellow pie in a sea of pepperoni (red) on L2 Beats security summary. It has over 50% market share and around 500 protocols building on it. A market share of this size puts us in a unique position wherein anything we do for the community, we do for us.

The DAO has a multi-billion dollar warchest. We have more developers than most chains, but we don’t currently know how to best mobilize them for the benefit of the ecosystem. These advantages might be thought of as having the “high-ground”. How do we maintain this position?
Dichotomy of L2 Competition
Arbitrum faces competition as a provider of blockspace with fair sequencing from both L1 and L2 projects. While the L1’s could be seen as competition to Arbitrum, the L2s can be seen as co-opetition. They present a challenge as an alternative for developers and users, they are also critical to the success of Ethereum providing both decentralization and public goods support. This dichotomy makes it critical for Arbitrum to understand who it is attracting and why.
Another way of viewing this is that all blockchains are in competition with web 2. In this framing, we might be inclined to consider that competition is not our highest concern. Perhaps, the competition is less an economic competition for blockspace and more a technological race to develop the technology that best guarantees the neutrality of digital public infrastructure.
Decentralization as a Risk & Benefit
Serving sequencer fees to the DAO and hosting critical multisig elections via smart contracts are hallmark characteristics of Arbitrum’s DAO and founding values. Decentralization is not only a desire, but a critical requirement of the technology AND its governance. Arbitrum provides the ideal technology stack to ensure a user who puts their assets in the system and interacts with smart contracts is maximally protected from the whims of the system operator.
This neutrality is not an option, but a requirement which must be a priority of the DAO. History saw Facebook rug Zynga about a decade after AOL rugged developers in the same way.
At the same time, DAOs are notoriously bad at keeping focus. By continuously keeping our collective eye on the ball, we reduce the risk that we forget our core promise to builders.
4C Strategy Policy
The policy should define actions which should be taken while not defining how they should be done. Like guardrails on the highway, these provide boundaries for acceptable behavior.
Community * Coherence * Coordination * Competence
Bringing coherence to our community in a way that enables better coordination thus driving competency to where it is most needed.
All actions taken by Plurality Labs will be driven through this lens. As you read about the strategic actions, return to the 4C strategy policy and think about how it shifts your perspective.
Strategic Actions
Finding competency for specific actions requires coordination. Coordination requires the participants to have context or coherence. Coherence is imposed on a system through design and engineering. The ThankARB platform will be used to provide needed incentives and validations to empower the Arbitrum community with the data required to intelligently evolve.
Our strategic deployment begins with Sense, followed by Response, and then Evolve. Once started, this progression continues as an ongoing cycle.
Within each objective, there are three problems we aim to address. Solutions will emerge through a combination of the Plurality Labs team, experiments executed, and programs funded.
Objective 1 - Sense
Understanding, legitimizing, and communicating the needs, desires and capabilities of the DAO

How might we understand the needs and desires of a large decentralized ecosystem?
How might we communicate learnings to the community to maintain context over time?
How might we use collective intelligence to deliver competency & specialization?

Example: “Regular DAO” sets their strategic priorities with 5-10 people presenting a vote to ratify (or not) the results of weeks of workshopping. They don’t know if they have representative samples and the broader community intelligence isn’t harnessed in the creation of the proposal.
Juxtapose this with our #GovMonth campaign wherein almost 20,000 participants generated ideas and then we heatmapped the support for each idea eventually arriving at 4 strategic principles, cross-validated using multiple statistical and data-driven methods.
The usual way of doing things would have them make a forum post where maybe 100-200 people know that we have ratified priorities. We will be doing this step differently too.
Objective 2 - Respond
Create a modular suite of funding structures which best achieve the desired outcomes

How might we best match allocation methods to best serve intentions?
How might we balance the need for long-term context holders with decentralization?
How might we design clear pathways to success for funded grantees?

Example: We know that retroactive public goods funding is great for funding public goods, but not as good for incentivizing entrepreneurs. Quadratic funding is great for sourcing new grants but direct grants allow us to double down on high performers. Streams are great to maintain high context when needed, but elections for hiring prefer popularity & charisma over expertise. Different allocation mechanisms are needed to produce a thriving and balanced ecosystem.
Objective 3 - Evolve
Empower the DAO to make data-driven decisions using an open data infrastructure

How might we understand the data & data structures needed to decentralize evaluation?
How might we score value creation independently from execution of work?
How might we reduce bias to ensure the best perspectives gain prominence?

One of the biggest funding gaps identified in this “State of Web3 Grants Report” is evaluating grant funding performance. While evaluating at all is a start, we aim to provide an open and decentralized system for evaluating the work done, if the work had impact, and if it was a good priority in the first place.
ThankARB Platform
ThankARB uses the advantages of a community to enable the Arbitrum ecosystem to execute at a high level. Plurality Labs can facilitate this strategy to make capture-resistant governance possible. This is how Arbitrum will ensure its core promise to developers - that they won’t get rugged by the technology on which they are building.
Backed by ThriveCoin technology & team, the ThankARB platform:

Incentivizes minimum viable decentralization for fairness
Incentivizes statistically significant participation for legitimacy
Incentivizes participation in allocation and evaluation experiments
Auto-validates actions both onchain and offchain
Human reviews to ensure auto-validated submissions are quality
Transparent onchain reporting for open auditing

Moving Forward: Funding of Strategic Priorities
The strategic priorities were a result of our first “Sense” experiment. These are the needs and desires of the community and the future areas of funding for the Plurality Labs grants programs. By combining the executive strategic priorities with our 4C strategy policy, we have identified the following opportunities.
Funding of Plurality Labs grant programs will require that they help move forward one or more of the strategic priorities. The opportunities within each priority are guidance for the outcomes we would like to see funded. This can be accomplished through a Plurality Labs grant program, another grant program, or a direct proposal to Arbitrum DAO.
We will work to support proposals that seek to provide outcomes aligned to the strategic priorities below. In our 2nd milestone, we will aim to complement the work done thus far to make meaningful impact in all of these areas, massively scaling the amount of funding the DAO can effectively allocate aligned with our strategic priorities.

How might we create a transparent and auditable substrate for grant evaluations?
How might we test fully decentralized and onchain allocation mechanisms?
How might we setup time/milestone based unlock schedules for grant funding?

Community Participation
Community Conversations

How might we involve the community in regular feedback loops?
How might we establish and validate web 3 native communication channels?
How might we open the grant evaluation process to involve community members?

Retroactive Funding Program

How might we set a precedent that encourages the community to step up when needed?
How might we establish a role for badge holders who evaluate eligibility?

Wayfinding Improvements

How might we build and socialize a go-to page for people new to Arbitrum?
How might we connect inquiries to community members willing to help?
How might we increase the number of quality grant proposals funded by Arbitrum?

Conclusion
ThankARB is a strategic framework for the Arbitrum ecosystem. Plurality Labs will use this framework to guide how it allocates grant funding and how it designs a grant funding framework. We invite others to join our strategy, however, the DAO always maintains the right to approve funding outside of our program, framework, and to follow a different execution strategy.
We aren’t looking to ratify this strategy, the strategic priorities, or the Vision, Mission, & Values we have presented because if they are indeed legitimate, the community will opt-in to participating and continue to support us.
Communities are full of competent ideas and people, but they lack a strategy to leverage these assets. To find and leverage competency, a community must coordinate. To coordinate, they require coherence in understanding where, why, what, and how. ThankARB will provide this.
Arbitrum has a unique market leading position. By accelerating the pace at which we can competently execute we will ensure the promise of Arbitrum to developers, the value of Arbitrum governance to the community, and the success of Ethereum.
We thank the Arbitrum community for the opportunity to drive a grants framework serving its success. That is why we are calling our overall program ThankARB.",1
19242,GFXlabs,2023-10-30 11:06:29,"Could someone with mod powers pin a thread that lists ongoing votes?
It’s very easy to miss when a vote goes to Snapshot or Tally, especially when the only indication is an update to the original thread, but never in the comments (example).
It would probably improve participation if there was a single place on the forum to list and draw attention to any ongoing votes. Ideally each vote’s notification on the thread would be deleted upon closure and the thread would be locked to prevent random spam comments or debates about the merits of a proposal occurring on the notification thread rather than the proposal thread.
Thank you in advance. Also interested in any alerts others use. We used Senate, but that is winding down and doesn’t send alerts anymore.",1

12835,KLYK,2023-04-17 07:56:10,"Arbitrum is a type of technology known as an optimistic rollup. (CoinMarketCap)
Optimistic rollups are layer 2 (L2) protocols designed to extend the throughput of Ethereum’s base layer. They reduce computation on the main Ethereum chain by processing transactions “off-chain”, offering significant improvements in processing speeds. Unlike other scaling solutions, such as sidechains, optimistic rollups derive security from Mainnet by publishing transaction results “on-chain”, or plasma chains, which also verify transactions on Ethereum with fraud proofs, but store transaction data elsewhere. (ethereum.org)
So it sounds like a Decentralized CBDC, or a DBDC (Decentralized Bank Digital Currency). Is that where your interest are?",2

The idea of this post is to try to understand the possible win-win scenarios of a partnership for Arbitrum and get community feedback.
Where do I see value for Arbitrum ecosystem in partnership with EXMO:
1/ Onboarding all the 1mln+ users of EXMO to Arbitrum via creating addresses for them and incentivize deposits / withdrawals of assets on Arbitrum. Specifically, let users buy USDT, USDC, ETH and other assets via debit/credit cards, Google/Apple Pay and other payment methods choosing Arbitrum blockchain as a preferred one. Update the existing “buy crypto“ pages (https://exmo.com/buy-crypto) to make 50k monthly users aware of this solution;
2/ Pair most of the altcoins on EXMO with ARB to boost the ARB trading volume;
3/ Reduce trading fees for users who hold a specific amount of ARB on their balance;
4/ Launchpad for Arbitrum protocols. Let the normies take part in the IEOs of the protocols to be launched on Arbitrum. Which in turn creates an incentive for devs to build on Arbitrum first to get exposure to normies;
5/ Boost the TVL of Arbitrum via supplying users’ assets to the lending & yield generating protocols deployed on Arbitrum. Currently, our users supplied $2.5mln+ of assets to Gearbox DAO lending pools;
6/ Integrate stablecoins deployed on Arbitrum to the B2B acquiring solution. We’re building our own payment provider that will enable merchants to accept fiat and receive stablecoins. We can make Arbitrum assets a preferred way to onramp fiat.

18521,Mysterymen,2023-10-10 01:44:20,"Abstract:
This proposal recommends the allocation of 500,000 $ARB tokens, equivalent to 0.005% of the total supply, to acknowledge and reward the outstanding contributions of Arbitrum community members known as “Arbiters.” These contributors have played pivotal roles in Arbitrum’s development, from translation and publicity to community support and protection from fraudulent activity. By establishing a transparent and equitable reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, we aim to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication, fostering the growth of our ecosystem.
Motivation:
The Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:

Recognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum’s development.
Demonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.
Establish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.
Inspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.

Rationale:
The Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in shaping Arbitrum over the past two years. These dedicated individuals have contributed significantly through a wide range of activities, including translation, promotion, event organization, community guidance, safety assurance, and collaboration with other communities. These efforts have been essential to the success and vibrancy of the Arbitrum community.
Partial contribution value
Since 2021-2023, the work and contributions made by Arbiter are too numerous to list and quantify individually, and the data provided are statistically estimated due to the lack of prior targeted data counting and retention.

Provided millions of help to Arbitrum community users and developers. It allows Arbitrum team members to focus more on the development of technology, and also allows millions of Arbitrum community members to get answers to all kinds of questions and needs feedback. (Anyone can view the help and contributions of the arbitrators on the arbitrum Discord server, wechat groups, and other language communities, etc.)

2, Arbiters are online 24/7 (in Odyssey and Guild activities related to many arbiters are 16 + hours online, for community members to provide the most immediate, high-quality help) arbiter two years, has been involved in the maintenance and management of the community order, to report and stop more than 100,000 times of the scam, to ensure that hundreds of thousands of members of the community are able to get help in a timely manner and to keep the server safe.
3、Establish Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and other Arbitrum local communities, such as: Chinese more than 10 WeChat groups, WeChat public number, microblog, Coinhub, and other media (due to policy reasons, a number of Chinese media has canceled the account)
The establishment of language communities has further expanded Arbitrum’s influence, attracted more than 100,000 users and developers to choose to use Arbitrum, and promoted the prosperity of the ecosystem.
4、Translate and proofread more than 50 Arbitrum articles, arbiters in various language areas edit, typeset and publish Arbitrum daily information more than 2,000 times, publish more than 300 articles and blogs, explain more than 50 videos, and all kinds of accounts with a large number of real fans and readers, for hundreds of thousands of users around the world to provide a quick understanding of the use of Arbitrum and the information and guidelines.


arbiter has provided community optimization, management, operation, and promotion suggestions for arbitrum more than 300 times, making the system of Arbitrum publicity, service, promotion, and operation more perfect, and allowing Arbitrum users, developers, and ecosystem projects to get better service experience and help.


dock 30 Arbitrum AMA, more than 20 events, more than 100 docking projects, affecting hundreds of thousands of community members, attracting more than 50 projects to choose an arbitrum network for deployment.


Some Arbiters have their own communities, and as KOLs in Twitter and famous communities, they vigorously promote Arbitrum through their own influence, posting blogs and all kinds of information, and their continuous influence involves hundreds of thousands of crypto community users. This has brought great enthusiasm and new users to the Arbitrum community.


arbiters has been accompanying and witnessing the prosperous development of the Arbitrum community and ecosystem, continuously carrying forward the spirit of the Arbitrum community and promoting and marketing Arbitrum.


From 6,400 wallet addresses at the initial mainnet launch to 1,270,000+ wallet addresses now, including the growth of on-chain TVLs and a thriving ecosystem. Helped and assisted Arbitrum Discord to grow from tens of thousands of members to now 460,000, providing millions of high quality help, all kinds of Arbitrum promotion and publicity with millions of views.
The following document is the basis for some of the contribute saved
[arbiter Simple example table of contributions in different categories - Google Sheets]
Specifications:
Beneficiaries:
Arbiters: Comprising the most dedicated contributors to the Arbitrum community over the past two years, recognized for their exceptional and humble service to the Arbitrum community.
Distribution of Incentives:
The Arbitrum community requests a total of 500,000 $ARB tokens, to be evenly distributed among 25 of its members, recognizing their past work for the Arbitrum community.
Calculation: 20,000 $ARB tokens per member x 25 Discord Arbiters = 500,000 $ARB.
Wallet Address Collection and Distribution:
Arbiters’ contributor wallet addresses will be collected through a specified process, ensuring accuracy and fairness. If the proposal is approved, the Arbitrum DAO will disburse rewards to each Arbiter contributor’s address, following thorough verification and confirmation.
Future Plans:
Upon the successful implementation of this proposal, we will continue to enhance Arbiter contribution methods, ensuring the sustained growth of the arbitrum community.
arbiters will continue to translate blogs, do publicity, organize AMAs, hold offline activities, provide community suggestions, optimize community services, maintain community order, provide high-quality help to the community, actively connect with various activities and projects, and help promote cooperation with other communities. On the basis of arbitrum, actively participate in the arbitrum Ambassador Program and explore more ways to contribute, and continue to provide value to the broader arbitrum ecosystem.
Our goal is to continually contribute value to arbitrum and collaborate with the broader community to foster a vibrant and thriving arbitrum ecosystem.
As arbitrum continues to evolve, we will also be able to really demonstrate our knowledge of the protocol and help show more new users that arbitrum is the optimal scaling solution for Ethereum.
Milestones
When the arbitrum discord server exceeds 700,000 members,or when TVL passes $3b,or when we have helped community members more than two million times, or when we have made significant progress in various types of outreach and publicity. We are committed to transparently communicating milestone updates and displaying data about what arbiters are doing or contributing.
After this proposal, we will pay attention to the statistics and retention of examples of contributions made by arbiters, and data. This will facilitate more detailed examples and data presentation at the next milestone.
Conclusion:
The implementation of a robust reward system via the Arbitrum DAO is crucial for recognizing and appreciating the invaluable contributions of Arbiters to the community. This initiative will reinvigorate community engagement, foster openness, and encourage sustained participation, ultimately ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Arbitrum community. Transparency, fairness, and continuous improvement based on community input will be at the forefront of this endeavor. With this proposal, we are confident in building a more collaborative, innovative, and dynamic Arbitrum community that embodies the values and spirit of our ecosystem.
Your insights are valued and essential in shaping the future of our community. We welcome you to provide feedback and engage with us.",1

Article: The Arbitrum Foundation
The Arbitrum Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to promote and develop the Arbitrum technology, which is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. The foundation was established in 2020 by Offchain Labs, the team behind the development of Arbitrum.

What is Arbitrum?
Arbitrum is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to improve the scalability and performance of the Ethereum network. It uses a technology called Optimistic Rollup, which allows for faster and cheaper transactions while still maintaining the same level of security as the Ethereum network.
Optimistic Rollup is a layer 2 scaling solution that works by aggregating multiple transactions into a single batch, which is then verified on the Ethereum network. This allows for faster and cheaper transactions, as the majority of the computational work is done off-chain. However, if any fraudulent activity is detected, the transactions can be rolled back to their original state.

The Role of the Arbitrum Foundation
The Arbitrum Foundation was established to promote and develop the Arbitrum technology, as well as to support the community of developers and users who are building on top of it. The foundation aims to provide resources, education, and support to anyone who is interested in using or developing on the Arbitrum network.
One of the main goals of the Arbitrum Foundation is to ensure that the Arbitrum network remains decentralized and secure. To achieve this, the foundation is working on developing a governance model that will allow for community involvement in the decision-making process.",3

There are quite a few blockchain projects that aim to connect with nature, but this one caught me off guard. It has a “Discover to Earn” concept where users get rewarded for walking in the forest, identifying edible plants, mushrooms, and water sources, and sharing this info on their app.
It’s funny to think that you can earn by simply marking locations of wild edibles on their map. It’s definitely an unexpected twist in the crypto world, combining nature exploration with blockchain technology.
What do you guys think? Does this quirky project have any potential? Let’s discuss!

I recommend implementing a CAPTCHA and rate-limiting system on the forum to prevent spammers from sending automated messages. Although this has not yet become a problem, I have noticed similar behavior on forums that use Discourse. Spammers can send large quantities of messages using different IPs and usernames. By putting the appropriate measures in place beforehand, we can prevent the need to deal with this issue later.
With the advancement of LLM, bots can now contribute to forums and send messages that appear legitimate but have malicious intentions and embed dangerous URLs. Some even try to use XSS and other techniques to gain control.
Although this may cause some inconvenience for some users, implementing these measures will have overall advantages and help protect everyone. Thank you, admin.",1

16595,LowPolyDuck,2023-09-20 18:15:07,"Heya ARB ! Duck from Taho here …
TL;DR
Taho is launching our DAO in early 2024 on top of a browser-based map control game. Think: Settlers of Catan, but with gauges. We’ll be launching on Arbitrum One.
In Q4 2023, we’re doing a closed beta of the game + dapp on testnet with 5 partner DAOs. For obvious reasons, we’d love to welcome Arbitrum DAO!
With this point we’re looking for input on the onchain behaviors Arbitrum DAO would like to incentivize in connection with our beta launch.
Background
About Taho
Taho began as a community-owned web3 wallet, incubated by Thesis. Our founding team has previously built Casa, MetaMask, Fold, Thesis, Threshold.
Our current traction:


200K+ users have tried Taho


150K+ Discord


50K MAU


$150K+ in Gitcoin grants


Our goals in launching this specific play-to-govern DAO design are to:


Make the web3 user experience less lonely, more fun, and more multiplayer


Make it easier for DAOs and web3 projects to engage their communities


DAO & Game Design
The Taho DAO is played, not governed. It’s the game of settling a mysterious Island on the Net and battling for emissions.
The Island is subdivided into 24 realms vying with one another.
The guardians of the realms collectively form the Taho Council. They own game parameters, as well as all core DAO functions (grants, treasury management, etc.).
1600×1037 122 KB
How it works
Four times a year (at the end of every Season), emissions flow to all active realms on the Island, who in turn distribute it to their citizens:


The largest ones (measured by stake) receive the greatest emissions for their citizens


Inside each realm,citizens may claim emissions according to the experience points they’ve earned that season


How to play


As a Guardian - you create, grow, and defend your realm. Your goal is to entice users with exciting and profitable quests. Your growth will be blocked by neighboring realms, so you’ll need to execute multi-day raids against neighbors (and fend off their attacks!), to keep leveling up. Over the course of future seasons, we plan to introduce cross-realm alliance mechanics as well, encouraging community-to-community collaboration. We expect DAOs, projects, communities, and even social groups to act as Guardians.


As a Nomad - realms will compete for your attention. You decide where to become a Citizen and then complete quests to earn experience points. If your host realm is under attack, you can help defend it… or abandon it and sell your experience points on the black market.


Quests
Quests can be made up of any queryable onchain activity, for example:


Burning funds


Deploying contracts


Using specific dapps or protocols


Holding specific NFTs


Wallet
The Island is your overworld and the Taho wallet is your HUD. Users will track your active quests inside the dapp, as well as the in Taho wallet. Credibly neutral metagame.
Arbitrum DAO Alignment


Over 50% of Taho users are regular Arbitrum users


Over 130K Taho users/addresses have bridged funds to Arbitrum


We’re launching our DAO on Arbitrum One, these mechanics just would not be possible from a gas perspective on Mainnet


The Q4 Beta
The goal of our beta is to ensure the game is fun and understandable. And also to get the right projects in at the ground level.
Specifically, we want feedback on:


UI/UX


Is this as fun as our playtests tell us it is?


How can we make this as powerful a tool as possible for DAOs like Arbitrums’


Beta partners
We’re inviting just 5 partner DAOs to the beta:


Each partner gets a spot on the map


They can invite their communities to participate


They get the chance to launch incentive experiments (quests)


They get an early seat at the table for feedback and helping inform overall direction


The Opportunity
There’s no cost or time commitment needed for Arbitrum DAO members to evaluate our beta mechanism.
What’s needed from Arbitrum DAO:


A few onchain behaviors you’d like to incentivize in Q4. We will use these to write quests that beta participants can engage with. (We’ve included a few ideas below to get the conversation started)


Feedback on how we can best invite ~1,000 members of the DAO to participate (our current plan is to share a link here and on Discord for users to sign up using a custom Deform


Here are our working ideas of onchain behaviors the DAO may want to incentivize:


Delegating $ARB


Completing at least 1 on-chain transactions on Arbitrum per week


Bridging to Arbitrum One or Arbiturm Nova


Contract deploys


Participation in Arbitrum Odyssey?


Some additional suggestions from speaking with DAO members:

Voting weighted by vote weight
Bridging net wealth to arbitrum
Generating fees

16595,Sooryavanshi,2023-09-21 11:56:27,"""Hello @LowPolyDuck LowPolyDuck,
Thank you for sharing the exciting details about Taho 2’s upcoming DAO launch and the Q4 Beta on Arbitrum One. We’re eager to explore potential collaboration opportunities with the Arbitrum DAO. To help us better understand and align our efforts, could you kindly provide more details on the following:

Specific Onchain Behaviors: We’re interested in learning about the specific onchain behaviors or actions that the Arbitrum DAO is keen on incentivizing during the Q4 Beta. This could encompass actions like delegating $ARB, completing on-chain transactions on Arbitrum, bridging to Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova, deploying contracts, and participating in Arbitrum Odyssey.
Alignment with DAO Goals: It would be valuable if you could elaborate on how these incentivized behaviors align with the overarching goals and mission of the Arbitrum DAO. For instance, if the DAO’s objective is to enhance user engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, we’d appreciate insights into how these behaviors contribute to that goal.
Additional Suggestions: If there are any additional suggestions or innovative ideas you have in mind for incentivized behaviors that could mutually benefit the Taho 2 project and the Arbitrum DAO, we’re open to hearing them.
Logistics: Understanding the logistical aspects is crucial for effective collaboration. Could you share insights into how you plan to implement these incentives within the Taho 2 game and Dapp? This might include details about the mechanics of the quests and the rewards structure.
Open to Discussion: We’re enthusiastic about the prospect of collaborating and fine-tuning these incentivized behaviors to align perfectly with the interests and preferences of the Arbitrum DAO community. Please let us know if you’re open to further discussions and how we can best facilitate that.

Your insights will be instrumental in ensuring a successful partnership between Taho 2 and the Arbitrum DAO. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best regards",2

16595,rhizo_michael,2023-09-25 23:32:08,"You can think of each realm as a subDAO governed by the guardians. Guardians can be elected, overthrown, etc.
Glad to hear on the raids. WoW was definitely an inspiration 
Full transparency - we’re still exploring alliance mechanisms! Nothing we’re happy with mechanism-wise yet.
Great final question. Nomads only have governance power while they’re staked in a realm. If they don’t want to join any of the existing realms… our hope is they create a new one",8
16595,Noa,2023-09-28 00:45:48,"I’ve been reading the project, and among the points, I find the combination of governance and online gaming interesting. I believe it will lead to increased community participation, primarily by motivating it through a clear incentive system.
As constructive criticism, I would suggest providing more specific details on how the gaming and governance mechanisms will be implemented. It would be helpful to include concrete examples. The game of incentives can potentially lead to speculation rather than genuine community involvement. Care should be taken to ensure that users are motivated by a desire to contribute rather than just rewards.
Regarding scalability, it would be wise to project how the platform will handle an increase in demand and traffic as it experiences exponential growth.
In terms of transparency and governance, I would emphasize the need to establish a clear and transparent structure to avoid centralization in decision-making within the DAO.
One question that remains is regarding the distribution of rewards in the testnet for $TAHO. Have you already defined how it will be distributed? And for participation in the testnet, how will access be granted?",9
16595,LowPolyDuck,2023-10-02 20:24:13,"Thank you ser ! A pleasure to see you here 

The game of incentives can potentially lead to speculation rather than genuine community involvement. Care should be taken to ensure that users are motivated by a desire to contribute rather than just rewards.

This is something we’ve thought about at length, its a super important call out. From what ive been able to gather personally; questlines that promote tvl based [or time based] metrics are more resistant than strictly volume based ones.
Theres probably going to be a bit of variety in the various questlines offered by realms until a solid meta is in place.

Regarding scalability… project how the platform will handle an increase in demand…
…In terms of transparency and governance, I would emphasize the need to establish a clear and transparent structure to avoid centralization in decision-making within the DAO.

Scalability and transparency i can address at once. The scalability of individual questlines is hard to nail down [especially if a ton of data is required to be collected]. We’ll likely see things try and fail to scale-- there are great lessons to be had from platforms like galxe; not every desirable action is consistently scalable. And transparency is going to tie into all of this-- if it just so happens that a realm is attempting to forward a questline that would be impossible or broken, the citizens can see and veto that

One question that remains is regarding the distribution of rewards in the testnet for $TAHO. Have you already defined how it will be distributed? And for participation in the testnet, how will access be granted?

Not exactly yes, but not exactly no ",10
16595,rhizo_michael,2023-10-02 20:29:50,"Thanks for this Noa!

100%. Each realm is effectively a subDAO. The Council (aggregate of leaders of each realm) = decides game parameters, controls treasury, executes ‘global’ DAO actions",11

Following our previous update, Syncvote has unveiled additional examples of different DAOs, including:
Gitcoin Governance Process
Uniswap Governance Process
Managing a DAO involves more than just governance; it encompasses a multitude of daily operations governed by structured processes. Ensuring these processes run smoothly necessitates manual oversight, which can be both expensive and prone to issues.
I propose that we engage in a discussion to investigate the challenges Syncvote could address in this context. I would greatly appreciate your input on potential next steps to advance this proposal. Your personal insights would be invaluable.",3
11764,suga,2023-03-25 00:17:26,"It is a little dissapointing that on the chain that “real yield” was pioneered, the token released does not implement a mechanism to fall into that category.
Token holders want to OWN the protocol. And that means getting a cut of its revenue…
Governance is also a JOB, wich should be compensated for. if not, its prime for bad actors to take care of governance.
If they are not getting a stream of revenue, token holders have bad incentives to participate in governance. Their incentive basically rn is “make price of arb go up”.
This all is resolved with value accrual for the token from the sequencer fees and it has many more pros:


permisionless and decentralized validators, making the network more secure and fair.


real yield and value accrual for token.


part of the fees generated by the sequencer can also be directed to the treasury, creating a sustainable funding source for the network’s development and maintenance. This can help to ensure that the network remains healthy and robust in the long term, without having to rely solely on funding from current ARB holders.


I also feel like Arbitrum would further differentiate itself from its main competitor this way (Optimism).",1
11764,CryptoNick,2023-03-25 19:57:41,"If revenue were to be generated on the Arbitrum chain, it would most likely result in an increase in gas fees. However, low fees are a core feature of Arbitrum and introducing revenue would go against that principle, potentially leading to a decline in adoption of the chain.
Instead of focusing on generating revenue, Arbitrum should prioritize building a strong and sustainable platform that empowers the projects building on it. By doing so, it can attract more developers and users to its ecosystem, which in turn can help drive its growth.
If you’re interested in revenue-generating DAOs based on arbitrum, there are a few options. I suggest you go read about those instead.
edit:
Introducing revenue by holding it’s tokens would classify it as a security, which brings a lot of legal and regulatory complications. I don’t assume I have to tell you this is bad.",2
11764,suga,2023-03-25 21:46:12,"

Revenue is already being generated and kept for themselves. A privileged set validators hand picked. Or do you think they are running validators for free ?


Then every other POS blockchain (including ETH) would classify as a security, because this how they operate.

11764,CryptoNick,2023-03-25 22:25:17,"

Revenue is already being generated and kept for themselves. A privileged set validators hand picked. Or do you think they are running validators for free ?


Some trusted validators are being paid to have a node, yes. These parties include trusted entries in the industry and some have significant assets on the chain may choose to validate in order to protect their investment. I don’t believe in paying users for running a validation node, bitcoin doesn’t seem to need to pay it’s users. Why should we?
The ARB token should be for the government, not creating revenue. This could satisfy one of the points of the Howey test, which could mark its status as a security. Furthermore, if your proposal turns real, then it could be classed as a security because validators will receive rewards from themselves and others validating the Arbitrum network, as there is an expectation of profit “derived from the efforts of others.”
Although this depends on the country. NYAG has been looking into classifying ETH as security; Especially since they turned POS. I don’t believe in an ARB that generates revenue for its users. The government is to create the best conditions for the chain and for projects to be built on. We should ensure the lowest fees possible.",4
11764,suga,2023-03-26 03:49:17,"

Why do the validators should not be permisionless?


Why, in your model, ARB token holders would vote for the good of the chain if they have nothing to win from it? Why would they care if they dont have any financial incentive? Its like being a business owner but you dont get its revenue. (hint: they allways have a financial and they will act bad, for example diverting funds to 3rd party things that benefits them or whatever. It would just like an ad-honorem politician. )


**Best way to make the chain sustainable is that the voters are aligned with long term success of it, and the best way to do it is through staking / veLOCKING / give revenue etc. **

I really dont care if 1 nation-state out of 200 thinks its a security or not. This is crypto. Its a new system to break from the rigged one, and it should be properly aligned.

Why do the validators should not be permisionless?



It’s my understanding that currently validation is permissioned, but Arbitrum is on its path towards permissionless validation. Which is why they annonced a bunch of expanded validator set.

The crucial property, however, is that anybody can; becoming an Arbitrum validator requires no special permission (once the whitelist is lifted), only that a user runs the open source validator software (and stakes Ether when/if they need to take action). Quote A gentle introduction to Arbitrum | Arbitrum Docs




 suga:


Why, in your model, ARB token holders would vote for the good of the chain if they have nothing to win from it?



Essentially, there is a need to differentiate between the Arbitrum Chain and the various projects that utilize it to build Dapps. The success of the projects is dependent on the success of the chain, as it generates traffic, which generates revenue. However, if the chain is driven by the desire for profit, the projects will indirectly bear the cost. This could lead to decreased adoption rates, as a potential solution may be to raise the gas fees. This is counterproductive, as people were attracted to this platform due to the lower gas fees in the first place.

I really dont care if 1 nation-state out of 200 thinks its a security or not. This is crypto. Its a new system to break from the rigged one, and it should be properly aligned.

Okay, your point is noted. However many seem to go in the same footsteps as America, and projects which are based in the USA would be subject to the same laws. I think it’s impossible to say how much I disagree with your objective on this.",6
11764,BigC,2023-03-26 08:14:32,"This is active question and rampant in any network, recent launching program are kind of private. To me arbitrum success is not dependably linked to the its network nodes operating system but its convenience with fee and running fast request.
gmx, gns and Vela are highly consuming the 80% of the network activity imo for handling big wave of traders, which is not able on other chain. That’s already a success.
There are exchanges and other Dapp offering ARB staking already for incentives. But there’s no staking platform made by the foundation for exclusive earnings. That’s really  upsetting and may have hidden responses. ( regulation probably)
Also i think the ecosystem is mostly rolled by the developers and people with keen eyes in the ecosystem. Why would they get rewarded for taking decision. :))

11764,DisruptionJoe,2023-03-28 17:11:54,"veLocking is cool. Here is a mechanism I mention that is similar.



Active Governance

I’d love to see this. I’m a big fan of Quadratic Weighted Staking.
To utilize governance tokens, $ARB holders would have to stake their $ARB to “charge up” (yes, like turbo in NBA Jam!). Let’s say that staking for 3 months gives your 80% of your governance weight. 1 year would give you 90%. A logarithmic curve.
Flexible Voting would allow people to LP and earn yeild while staking for governance.
It is called “Quadratic” because the voting power is the square root of $ARB tokens held times the “charge up” coefficient. This makes the preferences of many more important than the few.
Additionally, by forcing staking commitments to vote, it creates a natural sybil resistance because bad actors are forced to play into positive sum game theory.
I’d love to propose this to governance sooner than later.

THere’s certainly no need for a needless token at a dollar 20 american per token… that’s just fleecing people unless the point is that retail will get dumped on by massive airdrop farmers (which is the case).

I did see the sybil issues. Those happen. I do think it could have been handled better, but that is coming from a person who spent the last 2 years fighting sybils at Gitcoin.

Article: The Arbitrum Foundation
The Arbitrum Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to promote and develop the Arbitrum technology, which is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. The foundation was established in 2020 by Offchain Labs, the team behind the development of Arbitrum.

What is Arbitrum?
Arbitrum is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to improve the scalability and performance of the Ethereum network. It uses a technology called Optimistic Rollup, which allows for faster and cheaper transactions while still maintaining the same level of security as the Ethereum network.
Optimistic Rollup is a layer 2 scaling solution that works by aggregating multiple transactions into a single batch, which is then verified on the Ethereum network. This allows for faster and cheaper transactions, as the majority of the computational work is done off-chain. However, if any fraudulent activity is detected, the transactions can be rolled back to their original state.

The Role of the Arbitrum Foundation
The Arbitrum Foundation was established to promote and develop the Arbitrum technology, as well as to support the community of developers and users who are building on top of it. The foundation aims to provide resources, education, and support to anyone who is interested in using or developing on the Arbitrum network.
One of the main goals of the Arbitrum Foundation is to ensure that the Arbitrum network remains decentralized and secure. To achieve this, the foundation is working on developing a governance model that will allow for community involvement in the decision-making process.",2

15895,DisruptionJoe,2023-08-16 12:24:44,"Thank you! Our AIP-3 Funding the Arbitrum Grants Framework passed Tally with over 98% of the vote yesterday. We are already moving full-speed ahead to implement our first initiatives: GitCoin grant rounds, September Gov Month, and so much more.
Part of our latest work has been to collaborate with the Arbitrum Foundation about the best structure to receive funds for the proposal. To fully focus on serving the Arbitrum community in exactly the ways that we proposed - but with fewer operational needs and increased tech and support capability – we chose to incorporate Plurality Labs, Inc. as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ThriveCoin, Inc., which will retain full operational independence.
Here’s a bit more about this exciting news:

There are no material changes to the proposal you just voted for.
It’s the same Plurality Labs team listed on the proposal (Disruption Joe, Shawn, Pepperoni Jo3 and Mary) that was entrusted with the support of the Arbitrum DAO community will be performing the same services at the same costs.
Our Plurality Labs team will perform the same work for the same outlined service fees - with the same level of operational independence.

ThriveCoin adds capabilities that will help us better support Arbitrum DAO:

ThriveCoin’s Thrive Protocol auto-validates, auto-rewards, and auto-records on-chain any contributions to the DAO. We can use this.
ThriveCoin has experience driving impact at scale for top DAOs, including: Optimism, ApeCoin, Bankless, ShapeShift, Aavegotchi and more.
ThriveCoin is already integrating its protocol with our service providers and grantees to incentivize better grant-giving.
ThriveCoin is providing support and best practices to help us ensure the success of our work together with Arbitrum.

ThriveCoin will not receive grants funding or program manager fees, and Plurality Labs maintains independence in decision-making for our proposal:

The Plurality Labs team will continue to have independence in our work on behalf of Arbitrum DAO.
The Plurality Labs grant funding and program manager fees for this grant will be allocated at the discretion of Plurality Labs and used exclusively in support of Arbitrum DAO.
A September #GovMonth promotion has been planned by the Plurality Labs team since early August. Planning for this included ThriveCoin as a Grant Program and is where the talks began.
We have planned to use ThriveCoin for #GovMonth. We would like to bill at the same standard rate ThriveCoin bills other DAOs – 20%. For #GovMonth this would max at $20k and be a simple service provider fee.

A quick record of events:

August 2: Patrick at Arbitrum Foundation asked Plurality Labs for entity information to begin a KYC process. We assessed how best to form Plurality Labs.
August 8: Plurality Labs and ThriveCoin began active discussions about forming Plurality Labs as a subsidiary of ThriveCoin, adding to our operational capabilities and significantly reducing execution risk.
August 13: Plurality Labs formed as a subsidiary of ThriveCoin – while maintaining our independence in serving Arbitrum DAO.
August 14: Our Tally vote closed with Plurality Labs earning 98.35% of the vote. We are already moving forward full-speed on our work to serve the DAO!

Communication with Large Delegates:
During the KYC process, we had ongoing conversations with large delegates about the opportunity to form Plurality Labs as a subsidiary of ThriveCoin. The general feedback was similar to our assessment: it’s a big net positive for everyone involved.
Summary

Thank you for voting for our proposal. We are so excited to serve you.
Our proposal is the same and our team is the same.
With ThriveCoin we now have more capacity and tech to better serve Arbitrum DAO!

We’re excited to start getting ARB in the hands of builders to create enormous value for our Arbitrum DAO ecosystem!

Introduction
SEED Latam is an ecosystem that aims to promote knowledge and critical thinking about Web3 in spanish, as well as empower the future Web3 leaders.
image1035×582 79.5 KB
Our History
SEED Latam has its origins in DeFi LATAM. SEED Latam, as we know it today, was born as DeFi LATAM in early 2020. At that time, the ecosystem was very different from what we know now. Along with the DeFi Summer, the idea of ​​creating a study group among technology enthusiasts interested in Blockchain emerged. Soon, that group evolved into a community focused on studying protocols and platforms that emerged during that time.
The gathering of those initial individuals who regularly shared their knowledge transformed into a network connecting dozens of countries and cities on Telegram and Discord. The community became a knowledge multiplier. From the beginning, collaborative and cooperative learning was promoted within it. Some members specialized in different Web3 topics. Groups were formed, segmenting and deepening knowledge to the point where spaces were created for communities and projects to thrive.
image1280×721 106 KB
Workshop in our ETH Latam BA side event with Chainlink and The Graph
Over the months, the “Core” and “Hardcore” teams were formed, with more than 15 people participating in the decision-making process. What characterized DeFi Latam from the beginning was a respect for the ethos.
You can find attached the DeFi Latam 2022  file, which compiles the activities of DeFi Latam during 2022.
Our North: Ethos above all
Since its inception, DeFi Latam has advocated for critical thinking through education. We do not endorse scams or collaborate with blockchains, projects, or protocols that are not aligned with our core values. Our priority is to foster critical thinking within our community.
We have a long-term commitment to the values of decentralization and education, and we avoid reacting to momentary trends or fads within the crypto space. We firmly believe that the ecosystem should be built on a solid foundation, which is why community members and the actions we undertake are aligned with our Ethos.
Collaboration, Cooperation, and Evolution
Last year, a significant part of the Core team, Hardcore team, collaborators, and community members took part in ETH Latam, the first and largest event in Argentina. It was an immense joy for the people in the region, as amidst the crisis, we celebrated a hopeful spirit fueled by the motivation that blockchain technology gives us.
image1280×719 87 KB
For Latin Americans, technology is a tool that helps us overcome socioeconomic barriers and allows us to build and be part of this paradigm. We also participated in Devcon, collaborating with ETH Global and ETH Latam Bogotá.
Amongst all these activities, we found a limitation: our name. Despite the recognition we had gained for our work, being known as “DeFi Latam” was constraining us. We didn’t want to be identified solely as a community focused on “DeFi.” At that time, the Spanish-speaking Optimism Español and Layer communities (both founded by members of DeFi Latam) had grown, engaging in educational activities that were aligned with our ethos.
image1280×721 123 KB
Our watching party - The Merge
Considering the context and aiming to encompass a broader spectrum, we decided to find a name that truly represents us. Thus, SEED was born during a community call. S.E.E.D. Latam, which stands for Sovereignty, Education, Evolution, and Decentralization. We started identifying ourselves by what we truly do: SEED, the seed of communities, projects, and now delegations. Some are part of our history, while others coexist and work closely with us. From SEED Latam, groups have flourished, such as Layer2 en Español, Optimism en Español, and Mujeres en Crypto, among others.
Lastly, It’s important to highlight that DeFi Latam hasn’t ceased to exist as such; it continues to exist as one of the communities that are part of the SEED Latam ecosystem.
Our Bylaws
We have established the foundations of our bylaws in order to establish the guiding principles and provisions that guide our operation at SEED Latam. We are highly committed to complying with them. We strive to build a much broader and diverse ecosystem to establish the pillars of what we believe in: an organized and transparent model for anyone to build and benefit from SEED Latam.
It is a public document that outlines our ethos, mission and values, code of conduct, team structure, treasury, delegate or governance representative election and accountability, grants management, delegation fund handling policy, among other things. The bylaws can be accessed in both English and Spanish.
The team and its new stage
The DeFi Latam team started with a group of five members in the Core team.
In response to the professionalization of SEED Latam, the growth of the community, and participation in governance, we decided to reorganize earlier this year.
In this process, Cryptochica, left her role as team leader and took on a new role as Governance Coordinator. On the other hand, Candela Fazzano, who previously led the Women in Crypto community and communication for DeFi Latam, assumed the role of Community Leader at SEED Latam.
These changes, along with the addition of new members, are made with full confidence that the ethos and mission of SEED will continue intact. Today, our Core team consists of seven members and other active contributors.
We have attached here a map of the SEED Latam ecosystem.

SEED Latam and its participation in governance
Currently, we are dedicating our efforts to the governance vertical as we are strongly committed to our mission. Through governance, we aim to amplify the voice of Latin America and promote participation. To achieve this, we need to be actively involved in decision-making processes to contribute value to the ecosystem. We advocate for a critical and objective perspective from our role as representatives. We consider the impact that decisions made within the Latin American community can have on users, developers, protocols, local institutions, and all those interested in the Web3 ecosystem. You can watch our Arbitrum governance calls in this link.

Transparency in SEED Latam: multisig as the pillar of our transparency
In pursuit of greater clarity, funds are held in a multisig. Collaborators and core team members participate in the multisig. This means that every transaction must be justified, and multiple signatures are required to ensure maximum transparency, security, and custody of our funds.
By requiring approval from multiple signatures for any transaction, we promote a decentralized approach to asset storage. This means that no individual has full and exclusive access to the funds, even as a core team member, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to our assets and potential attacks or misappropriation. With this methodology, we aim to strengthen trust in our operations.
The team’s costs, multisig addresses, and treasury information are publicly accessible and available in our bylaws for anyone who wishes to review them.

Our contribution to Arbitrum
""Before the official launch of Arbitrum Español, we started working on translating the documentation of Arbitrum DAO into Spanish for all Spanish-speaking users. We found it important to have the governance documentation translated into our native language, so we could provide those attending our calls with support links in our original language. Later, when Arbitrum Español was officially launched, we offered this content as a contribution. It was a great joy for us to know that we now officially have a space in our native language.

Team building: The importance of SEED Latam’s culture - “CaSEEDta”.
The Governance Day and Ethereum Argentina event provided a remarkable opportunity to bring together a team that spans across various corners of Latin America. Recognizing the importance of this occasion, we offer a co-working space for members of the delegations, collaborators, and the SEED Latam team during those days. With over 10 individuals making use of this space, it not only functioned as a place to work but also as a vibrant hub for networking and collaboration. Named as the “CaSEEDta”, this space felt akin to a home for our team. At SEED Latam, our ethos is of immense value and has defined us from the beginning. Alignment within the team is paramount, as we wholeheartedly support our principles and constantly emphasize the importance of contributing to the Latin American ecosystem. Therefore, this meeting was geared to reinforce these ideals, ensuring that each member of the team shares and embraces these same values in their journey.
This in-person gathering empowered us to strengthen our coordination efforts and gain a deeper understanding of the unique contributions of each delegation. Furthermore, we were thrilled to welcome visits from protocols and diverse Argentine communities, enriching the experience both professionally and on a personal level.
This interaction proved pivotal, fostering connections among different working groups within the team. It also marked the inception of in-person governance discussions, allowing us to address challenges and chart the future path of SEED Latam. Those days were marked by intensive work and added significant value to the community.

Ethereum Argentina: Our participation
The Governance Day took place within the #EthereumArgentina framework, the most significant event in the country held in the heart of the Crypto capital: Buenos Aires. It brought together individuals from various parts of Latin America and global projects.With over 3,000 attendees, 110 speakers, and 20 workshops. The event echoed the vibrant spirit of last year’s ETH Latam. SEED Latam’s involvement was active right from the start, much like in the previous year. A substantial portion of the team volunteered for the event, contributing their efforts to various areas in the lead-up to the event.

Some of SEED Latam’s core team had the privilege to participate in talks such as “Ethereum Criollo: Building from Argentina” by Romina Sejas, and the online interview with Vitalik Buterin about the present and future of Ethereum, account abstraction, rollups, and his vision of the crypto community in Argentina, hosted by our delegate Joxes. Among others, there were workshops led by NicoProducto and Joxes, as well as participation in panels with Pedro Breuer.
Furthermore, we were able to engage with the community through the booths we shared with Optimism en Español and L2 en Español. There, we spread the word about our work in the delegations and reached out with a survey for people so that they can tell us how much they know about governance.

I’m stoked to be part of the Arbitrum DAO through the airdrop! It’s amazing to see comments from folks from all over the world, as excited about this DAO as I am.
I truly hope we all stay active and help create a lasting decentralized space. We can learn from other governance experiments happening too. I believe the biggest mistake so far has been the high entry barrier created by complex and attention-demanding governance structures, which prevent people from participating as “layer citizens”. Althought it is necessary such complexity for the growing and safety, small but relevant ways for everyone to participate is essencial. Fair, decentralized governance is a complex issue that isn’t just for techies or finance pros to tackle. Everyone it’s important and no matter their background or the abbility to express themselve in English. We all have a unique expreience and if we all feel a part of the DAO, some positive system may emerge to change things.

11556,takeabreath,2023-03-25 06:37:51,"Hey @DrMath.eth, thanks for your post. As Arbitrum DAO is quite new, I think it’s important to be asking questions like these and find solutions that contribute to the long term success of the DAO.
I think in order to gain an active community, the onboarding process for potential community members (or potential contributors) should be smooth and effective in retaining talent and ensuring they can find where they fit in Arbitrum governance.
I really like Samantha Marin’s article on onboarding potential DAO contributors, she has a lot of interesting ideas on how to onboard contributors that I think would benefit Arbitrum DAO to utilise. I’ll be talking about some points inspired by this article.
The goal of onboarding contributors should be to ensure they have confidence [on where to contribute within the DAO] and knowledge [on governance purpose, process and communities/teams/workgroups in the DAO].
To achieve this, potential contributors should be exposed to all aspects of the organization.
They should initially be exposed to the purpose and principles of the DAO. Then, they need to understand the governance process, how to get from the ideation phase to the implementation phase. They should also have an understanding of the social structure of the DAO (who does work within the DAO, how work is being done in teams/workgroups, potential contributor possibly choosing a team to work with).
Most of these points are already explained within the constitution, however, where the constitution is located is probably one of the last places persons being introduced to Arbitrum DAO are exposed to. I think that potential contributors should be exposed to the purpose, principles and governance process of the DAO through a sticky’d thread on the forum and at least one read-only channel on discord (this is simple to implement, and makes sense to do so).
On the topic of the social structure of the DAO, this has a less clear solution. It may be worth speaking about this further, as it will allow contributors to understand the organizational structure and where they can fit in without becoming too overwhelmed by the amount of posts in the forum and discord.",3

I think the best way to keep the community active is to make sure that we keep the community going in the right direction. As individuals, we need to try to help others as much as possible, flag scammers and get them the heck out of here, and keep the ideas flowing :).",4
11556,DrMath.eth,2023-03-25 17:19:10,"Thank you for your comments. I understand that there are no right or wrong answers, only ideas to explore and experiment with.



 AssetBackedNFTs:

We all need to pick the most promising ideas to find killer dapps and other proposals that increase demand of ARBI tokens


I agree it’s good for demand to grow for Arbitrum block space with killer apps, but token demand should grow toguether with incentives to hold. A DAO token should have a lower market value than the personal value for being part of a community that offers unique, non-transferable benefits. Incentives can be created to discourage selling while maintaining freedom . This ensures long-term sustainability.



 takeabreath:

I really like Samantha Marin’s article on onboarding potential DAO contributors


Thanks for sharing! I’ve learn some interesting concepts like:
Self-selection and purpose fit : Culture fit can lead to radicalization and unhealthy alienation, while purpose fit focuses on achieving common goals.
Talent scouting is necessary, but it should seek diverse, hidden talents beyond digital, language, cultural, and economic barriers. Philosophical profiles with a broad knowledge range are also valuable. I recommend the book Range by Davis Epstein.



 takeabreath:

Most of these points are already explained within the [constitution]


All members should read and discuss the constitution, as its values need to be actively pursued. These values are a clear purpose, and there is no long term Arbitrum without them.



 takeabreath:

On the topic of the social structure of the DAO, this has a less clear solution. It may be worth speaking about this further, as it will allow contributors to understand the organizational structure and where they can fit in without becoming too overwhelmed


I believe members don’t need to know every detail of the organization, just have a broad understanding and a comfortable space to contribute based on their interests (I’m following the end game plan on Make and It’d be impossible to me learning everything about MAKER, that’s precisely why the plan make sense itself). Many DAOs lack of porpouse for part-time, limited-scope members and that is a lose of very valuable knowledge and contributions for the community. In a tokenized DAO, there’s space for different degree of membership and even people holding a few token should be able to find value for them.

16435,creedanew,2023-09-16 05:50:43,"Introduction
Community member tnorm recently proposed an Incentive Program aimed at enriching projects on the Arbitrum network. While promising, tnorm’s proposal may disproportionately benefit well-established projects at the expense of smaller, innovative, and underfunded initiatives. This counter-proposal aims to address this gap and suggests a more balanced approach.
Concerns with the Original Proposal
Overlooking Underfunded Innovators
tnorm’s original proposal sets stringent criteria for incentive allocation, which, while benefiting projects with high Total Value Locked (TVL) and trading volumes, leaves out smaller but innovative projects with TVLs in the range of $50k-$200k.
Established Projects: Do They Need More Incentives?
It’s not that established projects don’t deserve support, but they likely already have a substantial user base and are generating profits from transaction fees. Do they really need additional incentives? Further bolstering them could result in a lopsided ecosystem, turning Arbitrum into an exclusive club with barriers too high for most new entrants to climb.
If the primary Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for these incentives is to boost user engagement with already established projects, the initiative may miss its mark. These projects already have a large user base; further incentives would likely only drive transaction volumes and temporarily inflate TVL due to the ‘incentive effect.’
Risks of an Exclusive Ecosystem
Concentrating incentives and resources on established projects risks turning the Arbitrum network into an exclusive club, closed off to smaller initiatives and new entrants. High barriers to entry could stifle innovation, limit diversity, and ultimately reduce the platform’s competitiveness and resilience.
A Revised Approach: Introducing the ‘Innovation Grant’
To address these issues, I propose the introduction of an ‘Innovation Grant’ or ‘Underdog Fund’ within the existing Incentive Program framework.
Benefits

Holistic Ecosystem: This ensures a diverse and inclusive platform, inviting a broader range of talents and ideas.
Resilience: A diversified project portfolio can offer a buffer against market volatility and ensure Arbitrum’s long-term competitiveness.

Implementation

Require Detailed Project Plans: To understand the scope and feasibility.
Mandate Transparency: Through regular updates and transparent reporting.
Conduct Technical Audits: To ensure the codebase meets quality standards.
Assign Advisory Roles: Involve Arbitrum Foundation or community members in an advisory capacity.

Conclusion and Call to Action
Let’s use these incentives to help smaller, promising initiatives rise to prominence instead of concentrating resources on projects that have already established their place. This way, we create a balanced ecosystem essential for the long-term health of the Arbitrum network.
I invite tnorm and the community to consider these additional insights for a more comprehensive and effective Incentive Program. Thank you.


Agree with Creedanew’s Argument
Agree with Tnorm’s Proposal

15986,gauntlet,2023-08-23 18:10:36,"Gauntlet is excited to announce an engagement with the Arbitrum Foundation to support the migration from bridged USDC.e to native USDC on the network. As part of this project, we created this initial report to summarize the problem and our approach. In the coming weeks, we will publish a full methodology and recommendations for the migration and discuss these with the community in a live AMA.
Overview

This document serves as a starting point for the Arbitrum community to reach consensus around the risk(s) and tool(s) needed to support the USDC.e migration.
The framework developed in this document is expected to lay the foundation for future methodology on systematic way(s) to think about asset migration(s).


How to Conduct a $1B [or larger] Risk Transfer of Stable Asset(s)

$1B of ARB.USDC.e is nothing like $1B of Dogecoin.
[at least] 750X this volume trades on a daily basis in the FX Market.
You could find market maker(s) willing to quote entire blocks of a similar risk profile.
The big difference here is the underlying liquidity.
USDC.e doesn’t possess the market depth that exists in FX either publicly or privately.


Problem Statement
The Arbitrum community is seeking to transition its USDC.e stablecoin usage into USDC. In effect, it seeks to deprecate bridged tokens in favor of native tokens. While Circle has released the CCTP protocol to facilitate risk transfer(s), uncertainties remain around the success of this asset migration / stablecoin deprecation. This report outlines a universal framework for thinking about risk(s) at the ecosystem level to better guide the community. Success equates to both the minimized use of bridged tokens in favor of native USDC on the Arbitrum L2 going forward and protecting the community throughout this process.

2. Why Native Token(s)?

USDC v. USDC.e [ or: native v. bridged ]
All else equal, we should prefer native USDC to bridged USDC.e.
It’s simpler and more secure.
What are Bridged Tokens?
Bridging technologies, such as the Avalanche Bridge, facilitate the transfer of assets between chains. For instance, the AVAX bridge allows risk to transfer between Ethereum and Avalanche. If a user has stablecoin sitting on ETH i.e. ETH.USDC, that user can [via the simultaneous creation of an asset and a liability through ledgers on the backend] spawn AVAX.USDC.e collateral which is equivalent (barring pricing and liquidity consideration(s) among other things) to the original asset in the sense that it can be unbridged back to ETH.USDC.
Simple how?
Native tokens reduce dependencies. Instead of collateral depending on the dynamics driving another chain, it only depends on Circle and the management of the reserves. Further, USDCe. is deployed by the Arbitrum Foundation, while USDC is deployed by CENTRE.
Secure how?
Native tokens do not have the same risks that arise from cross-chain dependencies.
What’s with the Get-Up, Chump?
The Avalanche Bridge uses a set of validators that approve transactions before they are finalized on the Avalanche network. The transition to native USDC required a reconfiguration of the Avalanche ecosystem’s infrastructure and a reassessment of the methodologies employed in stablecoin integration. This transition involved not only technical adjustments but also strategic decision(s) regarding liquidity management, tokenomics, and ecosystem development.
As events like the Multichain MPC bridge hack make apparent, there are many technical and security risks around bridged assets. These incidents underscore the importance of not only robust security measures, but also comprehensive risk management in the migration process. While the AVAX migration is not fully successful [yet], this historical precedent shows the opportunity to consolidate liquidity, streamline stablecoin usage, and enhance the overall utility of USDC within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The community can take lessons from the AVAX situation when thinking about the deprecation of bridged tokens.
On Success & “The Migration”
Adoption Curve(s)

ARB.USDC.e [on a 2-9 month horizon]
Since Gauntlet began monitoring the one-to-one, unbounded migration of USDC.e on ARB (§A.1), nearly $150M (17%) of the USDC.e has been unbridged. By ‘unbridged’ we mean the USDC.e collateral that has been removed from the Arbitrum L2 and been restored to the Ethereum L1. While most of this collateral (75+%) has shifted back into the ecosystem in the form of ARB.USDC, some has transitioned to different ecosystems. **This is expected. Unbridging is validation that early adopters see the value of transacting in native token vs. bridged token.
While we expect this trend to continue in the short term, there is a natural limit to this process. There is substantial uncertainty on the specific path that the Arbitrum community will decide upon regarding the deprecation of USDC.e collateral. As a result, we must condition expectations accordingly. For the purposes at hand, we benchmark against AVAX.USDC.e while still considering the trend of adoption in technologies over the last 100 years (§A.2).
The success of this migration will depend on the security of the bridging platforms, the liquidity of the assets being migrated and the overall market conditions. The migration also highlights the need for ongoing research and development in the areas of stablecoin integration, blockchain interoperability, and DeFi ecosystem risk management.
Aligning Expectation(s)
(A) Initial Market State - [Snapshot on 2023-08-16]

(B) Complete Migration Market State (< 1% probability) [unattained on AVAX]

(C) Equivalence Market State (40-60% probability) [~2 months on AVAX]

(D) Native Asset Preference State (20-40% probability) [~4 months on AVAX]

(E) Bridged Asset Preference Market State (0-40% probability) [~1.5 months on AVAX]

On Market Risk(s)
Relevant Dimension(s)

Price: Risk of asset prices moving unfavorably.
Liquidity: Risk of being unable to buy/sell assets in expected fashion.
Volatility: Risk of unexpected price changes.
Flow: Risk related to asset flow and redemption requests.
Credit: Risk of counterparty failure.

There were shortfalls in the USDC.e migration on Avalanche across several dimensions of risk. While we will go in more detail in our future methodology report, the main drivers of bridged token migration(s) are price and liquidity. As we investigate the safety of the ecosystem with an eye towards minimizing the negative impacts on LP’s, we find that the community needs to come to agreement on broader aspects of system, incentive and mechanism design.
On Metric(s)
There are two initial directions on which we can analyze the state of the migration: (A) the dynamics that drive the USDC/USDC.e. exchange rate (B) user level behavior around token adoption. We provide an initial outline of (A) in §A.3 and an initial outline of (B) in §A.4 as well as ways to think about the mechanism(s) of risk transfer in §A.5. In view of leaving technical and mathematical detail(s) for later community engagement(s), we outline the central question(s) that our framework has been designed to answer:

Is the relationship between USDC and USDC.e on Arbitrum stable?
Are users able to transact both tokens for size?
Has a given user interacted with USDC yet?
Has a given user begun migrating from USDC.e to USDC?
How far along the USDC migration is a given user?

On Challenge(s)
Without seeking to spread FUD, we outline several challenges the community could face as it seeks to migrate USDC.e collateral into USDC on Arbitrum. In view of looking at risk at both the ecosystem and microstructure level, we can separate between ‘Macro’ and ‘Micro’ risks.
Macro Risk(s)

Disjoint Migration Process
a. Stop(s) / Start(s) relative to rapidly changing liquidity conditions
b. Halt(s) due to risk management around concentrated protocol exposure(s)
c. Uncertainty of user behavior due to insufficient metadata
Bridging Problems
a. CCTP has unexpected behavior
b. Unexpected Lag(s) in Risk Transfer(s)
USDC.e asset(s) being unbridged from Arbitrum without being onboarded back onto the L2
Knock-on effect(s) of asset flow in the context of unbalanced ecosystem incentive design
a. “Blowing out your shorts in an attempt to help out your longs”
Faulty mechanism or system design causing either (A) Circle, (B) ARB users or (C) protocols on ARB to unnecessarily lose collateral
Complicated UX dis-incentivizing USDC.e laggards from adopting USDC

Micro Risk(s)

Stable Asset(s) / Exchange Rate(s) becoming Unstable
a. 2023Q1 Gauntlet USDC De-Peg Analysis can be found in §A.10
Cross-Protocol Pricing Discrepancies due to Nonstandard Oracle Usage (§A.11)
Liquidity Drying Up / Pools Becoming Unbalanced
a. Users being liquidated / unable to transfer assets
i. Distribution of liquidations on Arbitrum can be found in §A.9
b. Protocols may preemptively liquidate given implied market depth
c. No “lender of last resort”
Elevated likelihood of both liquidations and insolvencies if protocol parameters are not suitably conditioned on volatility expectations in context of public and private liquidity
Token Transfer Issue(s) / Cross-Chain Asset-Liability Mismatch(es)

On Future Work
Ecosystem risk management is a game of (A) identifying, (B) analyzing, (C) communicating and (D) adjusting the relevant protocol levers to minimize holistic negative impacts on LP’s. While the early adopters of the migration continue to shift collateral into the new USDC, the community needs to take further action needs taken to further action to facilitate the rest of the process. As we have outlined above, the primary gradient(s) of market risk are (1) price and (2) liquidity. However, the community needs to make considerations about (3) volatility, (4) flow and (5) credit in the context of suitable design to comprehensively map out risk(s) at the ecosystem level. Incentives shapes adoption likelihood, mechanisms shape adoption success, and system design shapes feasibility.
Community Engagement
In view of supporting this framework, Gauntlet will be doing an AMA with the Arbitrum Foundation in the next couple weeks. Further, we will release a Methodology Report that extends this framework to a comprehensive analysis after community feedback. Further announcements coming.

§A.2: Adoption Curve Slope(s)
Adoption curves are getting steeper over time due to increased network effects. However, not all adoption curve converge to 100%. While some curves converge to 100 - e, others converge to 100 - c where 0 < e << c < 100. This is due to structural constraints around adoption for a given technology (you can’t build fiber wires everywhere). While these constraints vary with the product [e.g. GPT vs. electricity], there are reasons to believe - in general - that we should align expectations based on what adoption curve(s) are expected to look like given technological constraints and forward looking view(s) on network effects.
§A.3: Exchange Rate(s)
§A.3.1: Definition(s)
appendix1705×96 11.2 KB
§A.3.2: Context
The ‘exchange rate’ is to be understood in the same way as exchange rates in the FX market. The most important dimension is stability. Stability can be characterized by (A) the relative prices and (B) the volatility of the rate.  When deprecating volatile assets, we need to adjust expectations accordingly. Further, liquidity considerations are implicit in exchange rate stability.  A necessary condition of exchange rate stability is the ability to transact the relevant collateral in a stable fashion for size. This can be (A) fully automated or (B) done via the backing of market-makers. If a fully automated solution is decided upon, some entity must be assigned the equivalent capacity of ‘Central Banker’ to ensure there is sufficient collateral [of either token] in the pool. If liquidity dries up and there is no entity and/or mechanism to backstop liquidity, the migration can fail. This is why in traditional financial system(s) there is usually a ‘lender of last resort.’
§A.4: Some Atomic User Characteristic(s)
§A.4.1: Definition(s)
formula2695×194 16.4 KB
§A.4.2: Context
A more precise characterization would index on time, factor in dynamic prices/liquidity and analyze transactions atomically. We abstract from these dynamics in the initial migration report, but may add complexity depending on future Arbitrum community consensus.
§A.5: Mechanism(s) to Support Migration(s)
Implicit in a migration is some mechanism that facilitates risk transfer(s). There are two main ways that this mechanism can be backed. §A.5.1 is via an implicit extension of credit. §A.5.2 is via the creation and redemption of the assets into common liquidity. We go into more detail on these market mechanisms below. Let D be the deprecating collateral,  T the target collateral and C common liquidity [usually, C = USD, but C can be ETH].
§A.5.1: Extension(s) of Credit
§A.5.1.1: A Useful Analogy
When you sit down at a restaurant and run up a tab, that restaurant is implicitly extending you short duration credit. That is, they underwrite the debt until you pay for the meal.
§A.5.1.2: A Mechanism Specification

Transfer of D from user to custodian
Transfer of T from custodian to user

§A.5.1.3: Context
In the ARB.USDC.e situation, [credit] risk is being specifically underwritten given the dependency between counterparties. If the custodian fails to transfer back T, the user is subject to counterparty failure. If an adversarial user sends defective units of D and the custodian does not detect its insufficiency before sending back T, the custodian is subject to counterparty failure. In most situations, the asset transfer(s) in this framework would be (relatively) instantaneous and the risk is primarily on the custodian who creates a synthetic long D / short T position that is flattened once the custodian receives the D collateral in its account.
§A.5.2: Creation(s) / Redemption(s) [CR/RD]
formula3704×136 10.8 KB
§A.5.2.2: A Mechanism Specification

Transfer of D from user to custodian
Redemption of D into C
Creation of T from C
Transfer of T from custodian to user

§A.5.2.3: Context
The tradeoff here is that the we give up instantaneous transfer for minimized credit risk. While the collateral still goes from user → custodian → user, instead of D being instantaneously swapped for T (from the user’s perspective), we introduce some lag and a mechanism that can spawn and collapse collateral of heterogeneous type(s). This mechanism [CR/RD] converts D into common liquidity C and then uses that to create units of T that are sent back to the user. As removing risk is generally more complicated than adding risk, the bottleneck for most assets is (2) particularly when there are features like bridging that need to be undone from the standpoint of the custodian.
While this may seem like an tangential set of concepts more tied to ETF Arbitrage in TradFi than Asset Migration(s) in Web3, it is particularly important in the case of bridged assets. In particular, we cannot assume in general that the un-bridging of assets will occur instantaneously. Rather, we should expect a lag (which can be variable depending on smart contract design). Due to this lag, we should not think of credit provision in the atomic sense like we can do for things like Flash Loans on Aave. Instead, we should think of credit provision on a longer horizon. As a result, the community needs to achieve consensus on how it plans to manage credit risk(s).
§A.6: Metadata
Beyond transparency, distributed consensus & anti-censorship among other useful properties, Web3 infrastructure allows ecosystems and protocols to spin up new assets to track metadata. A concrete example is an LST like stETH where that token tracks the metadata tied to the staking of ETH with LIDO DAO. It is a contingent claim, not a first class citizen as far as collateral goes. Given this powerful ability to spawn tokens to track metadata, the community should think more deeply about what they would like to track about their users and how tokens tracking metadata can be used to get a more robust picture of ecosystem asset migration.
§A.7: Incentive Optimization(s)
Positions have inertia. By default, we should expect risk to remain where it is absent outside incentives. While superior technological innovation (e.g. native vs. bridged tokens) is one such incentive, in general this will not be sufficient for 100% adoption. In a Web3 context, adoption is a function of decentralized coordination. In addition to metadata, the community should investigate other dimensions of smart contract design that can be used to speed up adoption (e.g. IR research, structured rewards / airdrops, rebates, community equity tokens, etc.)

Vertex offers 3 categories of markets: (A) Spot, (B) Perpetual Futures and (C) Money Markets. While some of the initial parameters for Spot and Futures markets have been documented, risk management of this protocol is more complex for two main design reason(s):

Vertex aims to achieve 10-30 ms transaction speeds (competitive with CEX). To facilitate high-frequency marking of positions on the platform, it intends to use Stork as a pricing oracle.
Vertex offers ‘Universal Cross Margin’ which is similar in principle to E-Mode in Aave V3 but a larger diversity of collateral is involved. We need to factor in additional risk dimensions like flow.

Abstract (TL;DR)
This report outlines a three-fold focus:


A framework for lending protocols that aligns with the changes in liquidity pool (LP) positions as a result of the initial recommendations
a. For Radiant & Aave: Reduce LTV & LT for USDC.e by 3% weekly after initial liquidity analysis is conducted


Initial recommendations for liquidity requirements, including suggestions about liquidity pools and GMX recommendations.
a. For GMX: Decrease Target Allocation for USDC.e (numbers below)
b. For GMX: Increase Target Allocation for USDC (number below)
c. (Not in Scope) For Arbitrum: Incentivize liquidity for a USDC/USDC.e pool


An alerting plan around USDC.e and USDC given the prescribed deprecation plan for USDC.e in lending protocols, aiming to ensure a smooth transition for users and providers.


Protocol Recommendations
GMX Tranching Recommendations
USDC.e Target Allocation 30.0% → 27.5%
USDC Target Allocation 3.0% → 5.5%
As the largest liquidity source for USDC.e in the Arbitrum ecosystem, this initial recommendation will serve two purposes:

Initialize the transition away from USDC.e in the GMX V1 pool
Provide data on how liquidity providers and trading volume respond to protocol changes.

We will monitor the changes and fold the analysis into our future recommendations based on the methodology below. We are also planning to review the buffer amounts for each of these assets on GMX V1 in the near future.
Liquidity Pool Considerations and Recommendations
USDC/USDC.e swaps on ETH.ARB should be stable, cost-effective and have low volatility.
(Not in scope, NIS) Gauntlet recommends to incentivize a liquidity pool [ which we will refer to as POOL ] with a robust set of lever(s) to adjust liquidity provider fee(s), in order to facilitate the USDC/USDC.e swap for global users. We recommend the Arbitrum Foundation and broader community push towards a concentrated, one-stop, solution to establish the market depth and mechanisms needed to successfully facilitate the migration from USDC.e on ARB. The example linked below is a current USDC.e/USDC pool with approximately 4.5M of TVL.
https://info.uniswap.org/#/arbitrum/pools/0x8e295789c9465487074a65b1ae9ce0351172393f
Aave and Radiant recommendations
We propose a weekly 3% reduction in the Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold (LT) for USDC.e on both the Aave and Radiant platforms, aiming to encourage users to switch to USDC. Alongside these adjustments, we plan to communicate with the respective communities in advance of any expected liquidations due to these changes. These recommendations will be made after collecting and analyzing preliminary data on changes in liquidity. Please take a look at the methodology section below for more details.
Introduction & Summary of Previous Report
In our Initial Migration Report, we outlined the following as the most relevant dimensions of market risks in context of the active ARB.USDC.e migration:

Price: Risk of asset prices moving unfavorably.
Liquidity: Risk of being unable to buy/sell assets in expected fashion.
Volatility: Risk of unexpected price changes.
Flow: Risk related to asset flow and redemption requests.
Credit: Risk of counterparty failure.

For this methodology and recommendations report, we want to highlight the trade-offs between a fast vs. slow migration, provide explicit bounds for liquidity, and identify user migrations to consider.
Towards a Proposal: Additional Detail
Some Prescription(s)
While these recommendations are ultimately up to the community to agree on, we want to highlight that the intention of these mechanisms is to ensure the net edge of asset swaps remains around 1 basis points (bps) (100 bps = 1%). While incentive optimization is out of scope of Gauntlet’s current engagement with the Arbitrum Foundation, we note to the community that edge levels in crypto (especially for stablecoin transfers) are often thought of in % when they should be thought of in bps. The issue is often the lack of competition that allows liquidity providers to charge more than they should. From an ecosystem perspective, a necessary condition of a globally optimal asset migration is minimized transaction cost. Put simply, ARB users shouldn’t have to pay much net-net to transfer USDC.e risk into USDC. As a consequence, liquidity provision of the USDC/USDC.e swap shouldn’t have that much “juice.”
What do we mean by “Juice”?
Juice is edge capture. Markets are profit-driven and the entities that provide liquidity to them do so for profit-driven intents (or they blow-up). As a result, an activity like asset swap liquidity provisioning needs to be profitable for the entities engaging in it [usually market makers, but we can’t deny that retail flow loves to punt here]. Game theoretically, these entities want their businesses to be as profitable as possible. As a result, they will “charge a lot” (e.g. wide spreads, front-running, other forms of indirect market impact, etc.) until someone else comes in specifically to compete against them. This emergence of competition and eventual “race to the bottom” (Howard Marks Memo) shows up in all liquid asset classes (Stocks, Bonds, Commodities, FX, Derivatives &c). There is no reason to expect anything different in cryptocurrency markets [SEE: US ETF Market Structure].
If the Arbitrum community wants to be forward-looking, it should condition expectations about market maker(s) and transaction cost(s) accordingly.
Localizing to the USDC/USDC.e Asset Swap
Barring weird market events, stablecoin prices are generally within [0,1]. As a downstream consequence of real numbers (or division algebras, if you will), for any two stablecoins X, Y their exchange rate E = X / Y can be any non-negative real number E. In the context of the Arbitrum USDC.e migration, what we are particularly concerned with is the USDC/USDC.e exchange rate which will be referred to as ER. In an ideal case, ER = 1 at all times. Not only would this require an ungodly amount of liquidity (more than needed for migration success), but in the same way as expecting 100% USDC.e deprecation on a medium term timeline is unreasonable, so is expecting ER = 1 at all times. A more suitable target is  where. In effect, we expect the exchange rate between USDC and USDC.e to be normally distributed around 1 with variance to the tune of a 5 vol asset.
State of the Migration
In this Methodology & Recommendations Report, we will consider these methodologies in context of the USDC.e Migration at both the protocol and ecosystem level. We begin with fresh mark(s).

Protocol Level Recommendations
Objective
The objective for this section of the report is concentrated around mitigating risks & ensuring the stability of the ecosystem throughout the migration from USDC.e to native USDC on the Arbitrum Layer 2.
Risk Mitigation in Lending Positions
Objective
To ensure that lending positions involving both USDC.e and native USDC do not expose the ecosystem to outsized risks.
Lending Protocol Methodology
Our recommendation framework is summarized below.
We will suggest decreasing LT and LTV on USDC.e by 3% per week on Aave and Radiant to promote the migration to USDC. To accompany these changes, we will message communities when liquidations are expected as a result of the proposed.
An example alert can be seen below:

Attention: As of date, the data shows that the following accounts would be liquidated if these param changes were adopted.  The list below specifies the USD value of collateral that borrowers would need to supply to reach a health factor of 1.1, on the assumption that their account’s composition of collateral types remains fixed.

Supply and Borrow Cap Changes
For lending protocols with supply and borrow caps:
Depending on the community preference, we propose a conservative supply and borrow cap of 80% of the circulating token supply on-chain or an aggressive borrow cap will be 120% of the circulating token supply on-chain.

It should be noted that while the total_supply metric refers to the maximum number of tokens that can be generated, the circulating_supply metric provides a more accurate measure of the liquidity that is currently available in the market. This is due to the fact that the circulating_supply metric takes into account the tokens that are in circulation and readily accessible for trading, while the total_supply metric encompasses the entire quantity of tokens that can exist, regardless of whether they have been released to the market or not.""

Liquidity constraints for liquidations
Of the 400+ liquidations that have happened on the Arbitrum blockchain since March 1, 2023 involving USDC.e, no significant liquidations have atomically swapped out of their positions. Below is an example of a liquidation that happened in June of this year. Below is the transaction flow of one of the largest liquidations of USDC.e in this time period. As a result, our borrow and supply cap changes are far more relaxed than Gauntlet’s general borrow and supply cap methodology. https://eigenphi.io/mev/eigentx/0xbfd3f31b9cb2e044e6be5303f0f683589fb47d7163f87f864eee4aa3e87fa4a6

Liquidity Provisions and Support for Liquidity Providers
Objective
The objective for this section of the report is concentrated around identifying potential risks to liquidity providers and defining alerts for each potential risk when possible
Real-Time Monitoring
A real-time dashboard will be developed to monitor trade volumes, liquidity pools, and price discrepancies between USDC and USDC.e.
Notifications and Alerts
Alert mechanisms will be set up to notify liquidity providers of substantial shifts in trading volume or liquidity conditions, thereby enabling them to adjust their positions in a timely manner.
Prioritized Risks
Macro

Complicated UX could dis-incentivize USDC.e laggards from adopting USDC
USDC.e asset(s) being unbridged from Arbitrum might not return as USDC
Bridging problems
Disjointed migration process
Any knock-on effect(s) of asset flow in the context of unbalanced ecosystem incentive design
A faulty mechanism or system design causing either Circle, ARB users or protocols on ARB to unnecessarily lose collateral

Micro

Liquidity could dry up or pools could become unbalanced
Stable Asset(s) / Exchange Rate(s) could become Unstable
Likelihood of both liquidations and insolvencies could increase if protocol parameters are not suitably conditioned on volatility expectations in the context of public and private liquidity
Potential cross-protocol pricing discrepancies caused by nonstandard oracle usage
Token Transfer Issue(s) / Cross-Chain Asset-Liability Mismatch(es)

Preliminary Definition(s)
NIS: “NOT-IN-SCOPE”
SWAP: USDC/USDC.e ; ER: the “effective price” of SWAP
TOKEN: the “effective price” of asset T ∈ {USDC, USDC.e}
For a given asset T:
DPGT is the de-peg threshold.
LIQT is the liquidity threshold.
BUFT is the liquidity buffer.
POOLT is the current amount of tokens in POOL
Methodology
Below we summarize strategies for responding to potential risks as they pertain to the dimensions of market risk identified above.
Price
Event(s)

USDC.e goes below 1
USDC goes below 1
ER trades above 1 towards $\infty$

Response(s)

If TOKEN < (1- DPGT) for asset T, alert that T is de-pegging
If ER >> 1 and ER’ > 0, identify if there is a pricing issue that is increasing demand (at the microstructure level) for the USDC leg of SWAP then alert accordingly
If TOKEN >> 1 and TOKEN’ > 0, identify if there is a pricing issue that is increasing demand (at the microstructure level) for TOKEN then alert accordingly
[NIS] If ER << 1 and ER’ < 0 and there is no heightened credit risk to Circle, conduct automated creation of USDC collateral and supply liquidity to deepen SWAP depth in POOL
[NIS] Design embedded reactive mechanism like Aave Killswitch

Liquidity
Event(s)

USDC liquidity in POOL dries up
USDC.e liquidity in POOL dries up
Relative liquidity between USDC and USDC.e get “out of whack”
Liquidity Providers pull out of POOL

Response(s)

If POOLT << LIQT, alert that T’s liquidity in POOL has dried up
If POOLT ≥ LIQT  AND POOLT < (1+BUFT)LIQT, alert that T’s liquidity in POOL is in the process of drying up
[NIS] Liquidity Provider / Liquidity Taker Wallet-Level Tracking & Analytics
If POOLT > (1+2*BUFT)LIQT, alert that POOL has excess T collateral
[NIS] Dynamic fee adjustment in context of maker/taker behavior
[NIS] Queuing Structure of Liquidity Provision (viz. price-time v. price-pro-rata)

Volatility
Event(s)

USDC volatility spikes
USDC.e volatility spikes
Liquidity providers pull out from POOL due to heightened forward variance expectations regarding USDC, USDC.e and/or SWAP

Response(s)

Market alerts in Telegram

Flow [NIS]
Event(s)

Spike in volume flowing from USDC —> USDC.e
Spike in volume flowing from USDC.e —> USDC
Liquidity Providers pull out from POOL due to aggressive liquidity taking
Liquidity Takers don’t utilize POOL due to UX complexity
Liquidity Takers don’t utilize POOL due to maker impact /transaction cost expectations

Response(s)

[NIS] Market-Condition-Dependent “White Glove” Risk Management

Credit [NIS]
Event(s)

Circle defaults on its USDC and/or USDC.e liabilities
Market Risk(s) damaging the value and/or access to Circle’s collateral (e.g. TradFi Banking insolvencies, funky duration + curvature moves in the risk-free world, repo market stress, government seizure, etc.)
Liquidity Providers are short USDC and cannot deliver collateral
Liquidity Providers are short USDC.e and cannot deliver collateral
Liquidity providers pull out from POOL due to collateral delivery issues

Response(s)

Market-Condition-Dependent “White Glove” Risk Management

Next Steps

Share GMX, Aave, and Radiant recommendations to their respective communities

As we close our week, our socials continue to grow. Our #GovMonth kick off tweet has over 127K impressions and over 19,000 retweets
The @ArbitrumGrants account now has nearly 7000 followers and Arbitrum now has the third largest PushProtcol subscriber bases with 13000 subscribers.
Now to the real sense and respond results.
To note, we do not receive former week results until the following Tuesday so we will be about a week behind when we report on Friday. Regardless, the results are pretty awesome. Our community is on fire with ideas pouring in, and we love every moment!  We’re beyond grateful for the incredible number and range of voices and concepts shaping ArbitrumDAO’s Vision, Mission, Values, and long and short-term priorities.
Week 1 Results
6717 allow-list linked accounts Retweeted our Kick-off announcement
10519 accounts from our allow-list signed up for Push
5921 accounts from our allow-list voted in ALL 4 Domain Allocator Shapshot polls (well over 10% of the vote total on each election)
17764 Submissions from our allow-list came into JokeRace (roughly 4450 allow-list addresses)
But here’s the twist: Alongside the gems we asked for, we’ve stumbled upon some submissions that took us on a deep and laughter-filled ride.  These entries might not have been what we expected, but they sure got us thinking and chuckling:
• “A man is not old until regrets take the place of dreams.”
• “Better to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly.”
• “Jack feell off his bicycle and got hurt. A beautiful young nurse asked him to fill forms. Jack finished them and gave them back. “Anything else? The nurse asked. “Yes.” Jack thinks for a while and said “I’m a bachelor.” 
We can’t thank you enough for the wild ride of relevant and delightfully irrelevant entries. Together, we’re learning, laughing, and building something extraordinary! 
On a more serious note, tune in next week when we’ll share data-based, emerging themes across all contests.

These bi-weekly facilitated sessions are open to all delegates and teams/individuals contributing to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Hosted workshops will use design thinking to understand the problems we are facing, align our conversations, and find better solutions.
In past meetings we have explored both bringing topics for discussion and letting the topics emerge from the participants.  The blended model seems to be working, so for our next call we will do a scripted 20 min exercise followed by emergent topics.
Regardless, we are committed to making these meetings less about information sharing - and more about issue exploration & next step identification.

16167,shawn16400,2023-09-04 18:11:00,"The Arbitrum DAO is excited to launch Arbitrum #GovMonth!
An opportunity for $ARB holders to express their views all while earning their share of 100,000 $ARB via ThankARB AND a chance for Arbitrum builders to grab over 90,000 $ARB in Grants. In addition to getting funding in the hands of the best builders, we believe that “sensemaking” is an important starting point and often under-rated part of DAO governance. This is our chance to get it done right.
TL:DR What is #GovMonth?
GovMonth starts with meaningful governance participation and as an $ARB token holder, your voice matters. Many grant programs fail to evaluate how effectively their DAO spends its grant funds. We believe that is initially caused by a lack of clarity / alignment on how and what the DAO prioritizes, often leaving evaluation to a small group of insiders or broader elections without much focus. GovMonth changes that. And it rewards contributors too.
During #GovMonth, we have 3 primary goals

Align the DAO on it’s North Star Strategic Framework, strategic priorities & how to reduce friction and barriers in the ecosystem
Gain statistically significant response levels to influence our DAO native design process
Begin tracking meaningful governance participation as monthly active users of the DAO

GovMonth concludes with the “Arbitrum on Gitcoin Grants” program where we will allocate most of teh 105,000 ARB that was dynamically assigned to five different domains by the community during the Gitcoin Domain Allocator Round. The funds +the donations will go to the builders, creators and community members in the Arbitrum community.
ThriveCoin: The Epicenter of #GovMonth Challenges 
We are ecstatic to announce our partnership with ThriveCoin, a pioneer in community governance rewards. From incentivizing DAO contributions to propelling campaigns with Bankless and BAYC, ThriveCoin is a force to reckon with.
 Your One-Stop Hub: All the rewardable actions for #GovMonth are centralized on our ThriveCoin landing page. Make sure to visit thankarb.com for a seamless experience.
 Stay Updated: For real-time updates and announcements, follow @ThankArbitrum on Twitter.
 Why It Matters: By channeling ARB rewards through ThriveCoin, we are not only incentivizing participation but also amassing invaluable data for future grants.
 Don’t Miss Out: Your ARB treasure chest is just a click away!
What’s happening this week?
This week we invite you to participate in six challenges to shape ArbitrumDAO’s strategic framework.

Sign up for ThriveCoin

Share your thoughts on our:

Vision - 4,000 ARB Distributed through JokeRace next week.
Mission - 4,000 ARB Distributed through JokeRace next week.
Long-term strategic priorities (focused on innovation and growth) - 4,000 ARB Distributed through JokeRace next week.
Short-term priorities (where can funding help reduce friction and remove barriers to progress) - 4,000 ARB Distributed through JokeRace next week.
Vote on snapshot for the Questbook Domain Allocators (make sure you vote in all 4 categories) - secure your piece of a 10,000 ARB pie up for lottery.

Our sensemaking process allows us to crowdsource intelligence; it encourages open and transparent communication.
Only with your active participation, can we gain a deep understanding of community needs, and preferences making it more likely that a strategic framework is meaningful and user-friendly. When a diverse group of people participate, we gain a wide range of creative ideas, sparking innovation that might not have been possible in a more top-down process. Finally, we believe that when you have a say in the process, you’ll feel a sense of ownership and engagement with the final strategic framework.
In short, the community wins and you win too.
In closing…
This week is just the start. The remainder of this month we distribute another 90,000 ARB to builders via the newly launched Gitcoin Community Round platform, we will have deeper conversations using Ethelo, we will continue to experiment with DAO native communications platforms like Push (formerly EPNS) and run more JokeRaces while you (our community) continue to earn your share of 100K $ARB via ThankARB.

If snapshot has already been taken of participant,

how is that going to encourage new participation?
Incentives bring in new and curious minds, doesn’t this cut out new participants?
Shoudn’t this have been retroactive instead?
Couldn’t any other sybil method be used or combined with snapshot?
",3
16167,prose11,2023-09-06 16:48:15," Prose from the incentives side here -
Thank you for your insightful questions. I understand your concerns regarding the potential participation limitations on the snapshot during ThankArb Season 0. Here’s a detailed perspective on our rationale:

Embracing New Participants: We sincerely appreciate newcomers and want to emphasize that our program is explicitly designed to be inclusive. An excellent example of this inclusivity is our Jokerace contests, which have an open submission policy. The top 10 submissions, chosen based on community votes, can receive rewards. This means that new participants and existing ARB holders can actively contribute. Note that only those holding ARB before Aug 15 are on the allowlist to earn rewards.
Balancing Priorities: The decision to base rewards on the August 15th snapshot was made to acknowledge and give priority to our loyal ARB holders. This approach enables us to gather valuable insights and data from those already invested in the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Sybil Concerns: Your concern about potential Sybil methods is valid; we take this seriously. The snapshot method was chosen to balance preventing fraudulent activity and fostering inclusivity. We are committed to transparency and plan to release a comprehensive report after this season concludes. This report will provide an in-depth analysis of the method’s performance and explore alternative ways that may be considered for future seasons.
Future Opportunities: It’s important to note that Season 0 is just the beginning of our journey. We are eagerly looking forward to welcoming new participants in the upcoming seasons. Even if you do not qualify for Season 0, acquiring and holding ARB tokens now will make you eligible for rewards in Season 1 and beyond.

Your feedback is invaluable as we continually refine and improve our initiatives. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to bring them to our attention. We are fully committed to ensuring fairness and inclusivity in our ecosystem now and in the future.",4
16167,ModalQuant,2023-09-07 06:58:09,"Agree with @thinkDecade that the structure of these incentives shuts out new participants to the ecosystem. While it makes perfect sense for the community to prioritize long-term token holders, that priority should be reflected in something like an 80/20 budget instead of all the incentives going to token holders. Beyond Season 0, a more balanced incentive structure would encourage people from other ecosystems to come and participate.",5
16167,shawn16400,2023-09-08 13:21:54,"


 ModalQuant:

Beyond Season 0, a more balanced incentive structure would encourage people from other ecosystems to come and participate.


I really like this idea - it echoes my sense that web3 has not even come close to truly unlocking the potential power of the network.  In web3 we have the ethos, we have open source, we have the desire to share, but we still reinvent the wheel in every. damn. DAO.
To the 80/20 idea, I am on the fence.  The governerd in me says “yes! lets open token gate participation for holders of any value aligned token!”.  The Econ-MBA in me says “dude, we are nuts not to use our own token for gating”.  And the weary-web3 side of me says “my twitter feed is so full of crypto-bot-crap that if we don’t find better ways of stopping sybils bots and air-drop farmers, web3 is going to be crushed by spam”.
So.  This is to say, I hear you. And we have not figured out the ideal mix of inclusion vs. spam protection, but stick with us.  We are learning and every season we will get closer to getting it right.",6

In reality, that is all just eye-candy. Let’s talk real work.
DAO Mission, Vision, Values & Priorities
Thanks to people like @criptonita.lens, @tekr0x.lens, @handlefi.lens, @4165306.eth, @02211.lens and many many others who submitted entries on Jokerace, we have LOTS of data to help guide our Strategic Framework.

Let’s do the numbers:
Long-term Priorities to Enhance Growth and Innovation Entries: 2345
One idea that we are seeing consistently: Ecosystem Diversity: including developers, users, projects, investors, and researchers.
Short-term Priorities to Reduce Friction Entries: 2668
One idea that caught our attention: Raise awareness of the benefits of Arbitrum and Layer 2 to overcome the inertia of users accustomed to using Ethereum directly.
Vision Statement Entries: 2215
One idea that we are excited about: We ignite a global movement - where decentralized governance and personal expression emerge as the guiding light for equity and inclusivity.
Mission Statement Entries: 2276
We’re seeing smart suggestions like this come in: To bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized future, ensuring that our solutions are not only cutting-edge but also approachable to all.
Looking to next week:
It’s another break-neck pace - here are a few highlights:

Announce the winner of the 10K ARB Snapshot raffle

TL:DR
The Arbitrum DAO is excited to launch Arbitrum #GovMonth! An exciting opportunity for all $ARB holders to express their views on hot topics all while earning more ARB. We believe that “sensemaking” is an important starting point and under-rated part of governance.
We’re thrilled to provide over 200k $ARB to participants in Arbitrum #GovMonth. This includes:

(Up to) 100k $ARB rewards for participating in sensemaking

DAO Native Vision Mission & Values
Strategic Priorities for Grant Program Funding
Hot Topics (Liquidity Incentives, Delegate Pay, Licensing, & Conflicts of Interest)


+$100k allocated to builders using the Gitcoin Grants platform

Using the output of the “Gitcoin Domain Round” we will distribute +100K ARB
Funding will be allocated to each of the following domains:

Education, community growth & events
Gaming
Developer tooling on Nova
New protocol ideas
Open category - for all other ideas





Why Governance Month Matters
At the heart of our Arbitrum community are its members. Your opinions and ideas are crucial in guiding the DAO toward a future that aligns with your expectations. This is your chance to directly influence decisions that impact our collective journey.
Your direct input will help us to recommend a vision & mission statement, prioritize funding strategies, set boundaries for spending, and build pipelines of ideas and information. All of this will be used to create a best-in-class grants program and jumpstart a new era of governance participation in decentralized & autonomous organizing.
How To Get Involved
Follow us on @ArbitrumGrants to keep track of the latest news. Once kicked off, you will be directed to the full list of actions you can take which will reward you a portion of the 100k ARB being deployed using ThriveCoin event tracking & automated distribution. Each sensemaking tool has its own “meaningful contributions” where you can progressively earn more by participating more “arbSense” which is used to track the points.
We have carefully selected a suite of DAO-native tools to better understand how the DAO wants to spend its treasury. These include Jokerace.xyz, Snapshot.org, Ethelo.org, Thrivecoin.com, push.org and Gitcoin.
What’s in scope for Arbitrum GovMonth?
During the month, there will be four primary concentration areas:

Building the Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission & Values
Defining the short and long term priorities for grant funding
Building a pipeline of the best web3 builders
Defining Arbitrum ecosystem stakeholders & communication paths

For more information on why these concentration areas are important - see the Plurality Labs proposal.
Let’s Shape Our Future Together!
Arbitrum GovMonth is a celebration of our community’s diversity and collective vision and your involvement is pivotal. Join us for GovMonth on September 04 to 29 as we embark on this exciting journey of collaboration and growth.
Kick off is just around the corner, so mark your calendar, spread the word, and get ready to contribute to the future of our community!

15458,iamoracle,2023-07-18 00:10:45,"Hello Community,
We are seeking feedback on a proposed incubation program for blockchain product development. The program aims to facilitate collaboration among native builders and launch their products on Arbitrum. It will run for six months and involve 64 participants with prior experience in product management, software development, and related fields. Participants will work in teams to build 16 different products.
At the end of the program, there will be a competition to determine the top four teams. Members of these teams will receive $20k, $15k, $10k, and $5k, respectively, while the remaining participants will receive $2k each plus cloud credits.
Benefits to the Ecosystem:

Increased number of builders
More innovative solutions

These are answers to some of the questions that readers might have in mind:

Why not a hackathon?

Unlike a hackathon, this program is designed to provide more long-term support to builders and help them develop sustainable products.

How will the program measure its success and impact?

During the incubation program, participants will develop solutions that address real-world challenges in DeFi, logistics, and other related areas.

Why is the duration 6 months?

As highlighted above, the program is designed to produce usable products. The longer time frame will ensure that we can deliver quality.

How do we ensure the security of the proposed funds?

To ensure trust and transparency, we will use a single milestone system. Funds will only be made available once the products have been fully launched on Arbitrum.

How will participants be selected for the program?

We will select people with prior experience in product management, software development, and related fields to increase our chances of success.

What will be our success metric?

The success metric will be the number of usable products launched on Arbitrum by program participants, as well as any other positive impact on the ecosystem that results from the program (e.g., number of people using the product, number of new users onboarded into the ecosystem).
Please leave your suggestions and questions.",1

We empower builders to push the boundaries of the blockchain ecosystem, forging ahead into uncharted territories. At the culmination of the program, exceptional teams will be distinguished and feted for their extraordinary work. While some members may receive incentives, all participants will be recognized for their unwavering commitment and dedication to the program.

We like the overall idea and we’d get behind a program that provides long-term support to builders on Arbitrum. It’s also important to note that such a program wouldn’t be conflicting with the current grant frameworks being discussed/voted on if they pass.
With that in mind, we’d like to see some additional information in the RFC before forming an opinion. The information we’d like to see includes:

Who is going to undertake the execution of the program? We’d feel much comfortable with a team undertaking the task, instead of an individual.
What makes you suitable to organize such a program? Having some additional information regarding the proposer and their team, if any, would help us better judge their suitability.
What will the operational process of the program be like? How will you handle the legal aspect for participants to receive their money?
What are the criteria that will be used to select participants? Given that each participant will receive $2,000 as stated in the proposal, we believe that selecting participants should be a transparent process.
What are some KPIs to measure the success of the program?

Should you be interested in discussing the RFC and the aforementioned questions further, we’d like to invite you to L2BEAT Office Hours for Arbitrum on each Thursday at 3pm UTC/ 11am EST on Google Meet.
We believe that such a program would benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem by incentivizing more builders to deliver usable products. However, in its current form, this proposal would be better suited as a discussion starter, as it lacks a lot of critical information to help contributors form an opinion and therefore provide comments on the proposal itself.",5

Our legal team is on the ground to help with any legal issues relating to the program and ensure compliance with the law.


We will choose the teams based on their qualifications and experience. Our goal is for each team to create a usable Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within the first three months. During the subsequent months, we will focus on getting feedback from users and improving the solution. It’s important to note that we will only reward projects, not individuals.


Our success metrics include the number of usable products launched on Arbitrum by participants, user adoption rates, and the revenue generated or Total Locked Value (TLV) within the projects.

15771,Soby,2023-08-08 22:18:55,"The $ARB token has been live for nearly 6 months and the DAO controls ~43% of the token supply.
It is my opinion that the DAO is overcorrecting and limiting the ability of the Foundation and larger Arbitrum ecosystem to be successful as a reaction to the controversial AIP1.
I find it frustrating that there have been no grants passed or incentives assigned to grow the ecosystem.
The Arbitrum ecosystem has seen such amazing growth without any token incentives/grants, but we cannot stay competitive without well thought out incentives that are beneficial for both the DAO and larger ecosystem.
For instance, last month there was Camelot proposal that should’ve passed. The liquidity mining incentives would’ve attracted new users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, supported liquidity for Arbitrum projects, and benefited the DAO by growing the ecosystem.  Most delegates said they support the proposal but are voting “No” because there are grant frameworks that are being worked on. These grant frameworks are a few months away. Worth mentioning that two of the largest delegates Abstained from the vote.
As a DAO we seem to be stuck, but we have such an amazing community that could do so much more if we empower them. So committed to process we’re not willing to act. It’s frustrating and as a large delegate, I’m making this post to hear how others are feeling. The lack of progress has been frustrating. We went from amazing momentum to nearly none.

It seems to me that simple solutions breed centralisation, centralisation breeds complex solutions that end up killing decentralisation at the root.
Essentially:

it is better to wait once for formalisation by grants than to solve everything all the time “ad hoc”
It is better to keep DAO-principles at once than to give a lot of power to the Foundation
It is better to learn to develop without grants and then growth with grants will be quite good

Our Plurality Labs proposal hasn’t finished it’s Tally period yet, but it was approved as was questbooks’. I think we are making measured steps forward as a DAO. Once we get going you will definitely feel the momentum come back. Next week we will have some big announcements coming to start driving things forward.



 Soby:

The foundation has complete agency outside of the DAO being able to replace its directors. They could launch a liquidity incentive program tomorrow without asking us and it would be legitimate via authority versus the DAO needing to find legitimacy through consensus.
Legitimacy through consensus means large delegates need to see a data-driven justification for the spending they do. They need to see a legitimate process setting domains and priorities for funding. There isn’t a shortcut for this kind of work. Below, I will outline how to spark action.
Discovering How to Get the DAO Moving
I facilitated a session last week including participants interested in figuring out how to pass a liquidity incentive proposal sooner than later.
The resulting action steps were for:

Someone to writeup the session for the forum
Put together a working group

Neither of these happened. The participants need someone to be granted authority to drive this work AND that person needs incentive (pay) to do it!
I offered to facilitate the session as a delegate, but didn’t want to commit to further action because it is 1) out of PL proposal scope   2) to see how the participants would drive it forward  3) bandwidth constraints
Since then we learned that Plurality Labs proposal has passed. The actions we will be taking to help build out a framework will be covered in the Long-term solutions. However, we were able to drive some progress this week on the short-term scope with the knowledge that Plurality Labs proposal is passed.
To get caught up with the conversation, the overview will include:

The Short-Term Solution Effort
After poking the fire, the workshop group decided we do need someone to drive the effort. I offered retroactive funding to be made available from a future grant program to get this important work moving if we track hours worked and outcome.
@tnorm has made multiple meaningful contributions during this process and has been active on the forum. The group was in support of him driving this work forward. His goal is to have a proposal on snapshot within 2-3 weeks. We also hope he can provide questions which need to be asked of the DAO for creating a long-term framework.
Plurality Labs Role in Building a Liquidity Incentive Framework
A long-term framework for liquidity incentives must:

Justify the decision to provide liquidity incentives & how much
Identify the principles the DAO has
Be seen as coming from a neutral arbiter
Identify a quantitative methodology for defining success
Minimize the need for delegates to individually grant incentives to protocols

All of these things require multiple rounds of sense-making to gather data that guides and justifies framework decisions.
Plurality Labs has been working on a September Arbitrum #GovMonth promotion which will incentivize token holders for participating in sense-making. (Announcement coming soon! Stay tuned!)",3
15771,axlvaz_SEEDLATAM.eth,2023-08-09 07:34:18,"Hi @Sony!
I fully agree with you that this is the ideal time for ArbitrumDAO to refine and accelerate its processes in order to strengthen the ecosystem. However, any progression must be built on a solid base. It is imperative that we manage our resources well and focus our efforts on areas that will have real impact. Proactive governance is crucial in this journey, and it is paramount to manage incentives carefully to avoid funds falling into the hands of mercenaries and farmers.
Also, the communication gap between ArbitrumDAO and Arbitrum Foundation is a concern. For this reason, the @seedlatam team, led by @cattin, has proposed the introduction of a Governance Facilitator role. This position would serve as a liaison between the Foundation and the DAO. We are confident that this role could have a positive impact, not only in speeding up processes, but also in improving them.




[RFC-3] Introduction of a new role in governance - Governance Facilitator Proposals


Request For Comments: Introduction of a new role in governance - Governance Facilitator
Introduction
In order to improve the order and flows of governance on voting platforms and the forum, as part of the initiatives of a set of RFCs promoted by SEED Latam in collaboration with L2 en Español, we propose the creation of a new role within ArbitrumDAO, the “Governance Facilitator”. This role has already been successfully implemented on other governance platforms such as Decentraland and MakerDAO. 
W…
  

We are committed to laying a solid base at the DAO. We aspire to have it manage a vast number of proposals and, at the same time, become a hub for the main protocols and builders of the Arbitrum ecosystem.",4
15771,toyagev379,2023-08-09 12:21:17,"It’s quite relieving to see someone finally raising their voice.
The reality surrounding the Arbitrum DAO is that the destiny of every vote rests in the hands of a mere half-dozen delegates. This is public and very obvious for almost anyone to reference.
Individuals like @olimpio and @ChainLinkGod, who carry the delegate title, seem to contribute minimally, if at all, to the progress of ongoing deliberations.
A puzzling stance is also taken by Treasure DAO, proclaiming they’ll exclusively cast votes aligned with their own interests. But doesn’t this stance contradict the very essence of being the largest delegate? It’s a point warranting heightened attention. Treasure DAO by itself can decide the outcome of almost all votes - what happens when Treasure want incentives? Should only delegates involved in the gaming ecosystem vote, taking the same position as Treasure?
Moreover, while acknowledging the nascent endeavours of these grant framework collectives, it’s imperative to underscore their vested interest in these matters. The prospect of claiming up to 20% of a grant framework as “cost” is undeniably a lucrative proposition. Naturally, these individuals would expend considerable effort to ensure that ARB grants are funneled through their frameworks. While I do not imply that these people would bottleneck the DAO for their own gain, one must question all scenarios and conflicts of interest that come into play.
Perhaps people think that the DAO has the luxury of waiting, but I can assure you that other ecosystems are making the most of this opportunity. Arbitrum DAO is sending a very loud signal to all builders and chains.",5

Naturally, these individuals would expend considerable effort to ensure that ARB grants are funneled through their frameworks.


The point of us designing a framework is that the funds wouldn’t need to go through a Plurality Labs managed program.
What it will provide is data showing how the DAO feels about certain tradeoffs. Many large delegates don’t want to wield their vote irresponsibly. They want to find out how the DAO feels before casting a vote which may swing the decision one way or another. They may feel that this is more important than speed to the action.
You could also believe that they aren’t taking their responsibility seriously, however, I have gotten engagement from both TreasureDAO and Olimpio leading up to the Plurality Labs vote and I don’t think either could be seen as avoiding responsibility.",6

Understanding Grants Frameworks Design at MetaCamp
1280×960 92.9 KB
Costa Rica is a perfect place to ride the waves, watch the sunset, and workshop DAO grants frameworks.
At MetaCamp, a gathering sprung out of MetaCartel, this is exactly what we did. Magic happens between cooking korean food or tamales for a group of 50, riding motorcycles across the Guanacaste desert searching for volcanoes to climb, 5 hour fishing charters which were unsuccessful in catching fish but totally worth it, playing soccer against the hotel staff, and generally vibing at the pool to eclectic & multi-generational playlists.
Rediscovering your inner child is easier when there are children around. The right environment sparks hope that most people don’t dare to think about. This is what separates the DAO natives, the MetaCampers, from your average product manager. Fearless belief that the solutions could exist. The belief that we can solve many of the worlds biggest problems. And the action-orientation to participate in workshops with some of the brightest minds in the space when we could be doing anything else in paradise.
About Legitimacy
Imagine being in a room with 10 friends trying to decide what to eat. The loudest two people drive the conversations. Introverts don’t stand a chance to be heard. After one of the loud people gets sick of arguing, we all agree to go for pizza… but did we really agree?
If we make decisions like this, some of the people will leave the group. They will find a group where their voice counts. It doesn’t have to be the loudest, but it must be counted.
This is what legitimacy is. It is the thing that keeps the group together across many group decisions. It is the feeling that we are all equal in our voice. It is the feeling that we are respected. It is the feeling that a fair process was followed.
Design thinking workshops can give us a fair process which maintains legitimacy.
Think about democracy. Half the people don’t get their way half the time! So how does a democracy stay together? Why don’t they split up?
Governance processes which feel fair are employed to keep the people feeling that they have an equal voice in the system. There is first the sensemaking, then the decision. In our example of 10 friends deciding what to eat, they could have used design thinking principles to maintain legitimacy.
How would this work? First, all 10 friends would write their preferred food and put it on the wall. Then, we could give each person 2 votes which they could place on the two that they like the best. After counting the votes, a tie could be handled by a game of rock paper scissors.
Is this a good process? Well, rather than arguing for 10 minutes and not having an answer, the group would have participated in an activity (sensemaking process) together. The decision wasn’t made by the loudest or most aggressive person, it was made by a process. If you don’t like the process, you could suggest an alternative to the part which seemed unfair. It might not be the best process, but it gives the group an answer. Most importantly, for the people who didn’t get their way, it allows the scapegoat to be the process rather than another person in the group.
Who knows - maybe the loudest person in the group was only talking the most because they were trying to fill the void left by 10 introverts unwilling to speak up!
The Grants Framework Workshop
1280×960 119 KB
Level Setting & Finding Common Ground
We started by thinking about the biggest problems we’ve seen DAOs have in relation to their grants framework AND thinking about the best outcomes and solutions we have seen so far. After 10 minutes of Spotify’s Retrowave playlist inspiring individual creativity, we then shared our answers with the group.
This helped us level set. Some of the things we heard people say as they listened to others:

I’ve seen that happen before - many times
I fully agree with that
Could you explain more about why that happened
Yep

It was important for us to baseline, to understand that while our experiences differed, the patterns which played out were similar. Almost as though the outcomes were simply following natural patterns.
960×1280 62.8 KB
Each person quickly read through their “heaven & hell” scenarios. As the group listened, people would hear a new theme and add it as a Post-It on our primary wall. At the end, we had gathered all the insights, both good and bad, into one place.
960×1280 92.6 KB960×1280 134 KB
Finding the Root Causes & Major Themes
Next, we split into two groups. Each group was assigned to heaven or hell. Their task was to take all the Post-Its with issues and find 2-4 major themes.

An interesting takeaway was that the themes produced by the problem and the solution groups matched! Even though they were derived independently, identical themes emerged from both sets of input signals.

Decision Variables Create Funding Models
Next, we focused our attention on the variable components of a grants round. We didn’t get to cover all of them, but our teams of two each thought deeply about how they might approach one specific decision type or mechanism.
Pooled funds are distributed using some type of allocation mechanism. You can think of a mechanism as a ruleset that could be coded to elicit predictable outcomes. This is dependent on a few other decisions that are critical components of any grants round.
Here are some examples of decisions that each grant round must grapple with:
Allocation Methods

Proactive vs Retroactive
Delegated Authority: To individuals or councils/multisigs
Collective intelligence: Quadratic funding or voting / Other algorithmic allocation such as Decartography or Jokerace

Different allocation methods are good for different situations. We split into groups of two to tackle understanding which allocation methods are best for what outcomes.
960×1280 155 KB
Grant Eligibility & Regulation

Inclusive or exclusive logic
Criteria

Sensemaking
Amending
Proposing


Disputes & Appeals process
Voter Discovery Sortition

Voter Voice Weighting & Eligibility Regulation

Gating systems
Retroactive Sybil Defense by behavioral analysis
Appeal process

Communications

Sourcing grants
Informing voters
Policy education
Supporting documentation
Support requests

These decisions make up a funding model. When execution of a time or amount based allocation session happens we call this a “round”. The iterative improvement of rounds over time is called a “program”. The person or entity who is driving the process is a “program manager” or a “round operator”.
Funding Models have a variety of outcomes they can drive. Here are some tradeoffs and considerations that one might encounter.

Deliver outcomes vs impact
Representation of minority voices in allocation
Public goods lie on a spectrum
Opportunity costs
Capital efficiency / measurability
Scalability
Precision of allocations
Providing grantees steady funding vs one off
Milestone based allocation

960×1280 81.4 KB
If different funding models drive different outcomes, how do you know which one to use?
This is the key issue most DAO grants programs need to address. There isn’t one funding model that will magically accomplish all of a DAOs goals. A DAO needs to establish a “framework” for its grants program.
Frameworks, Programs, & Rounds
Frameworks
Impact networks composed of both competing and complementary participants require a grants framework to optimally allocate resources. These networks, often DAOs, need the constraints of an agreed upon framework to maximize autonomy and efficacy of programs.
Here are some items to consider when discussing your grant framework

Vision & Mission
Priorities - Short & Long term goals
Values, Principles and Boundaries
Total spending limits
Outcome & Impact evaluation standards
Composability requirements for software

When these components are set in DAO native ways which maintain legitimacy, they open up the door for composability of programs. Many programs, especially those based on a single software, specialize in one funding model.
A good framework will discover the above components, communicate them effectively, and provide space for multiple programs to test their
Programs
Programs can be nested in larger programs. This makes the concept confusing. The difference between a program and a framework is that there is a constant manager of a program. A framework can be set and regularly reviewed for needed updates. The program holds or has access to funds which need to be allocated over time.
Evaluation and iteration funding models happen after rounds. The program is what continues to exist and improve.
Rounds
Time-bound is usually a sign of a grants “round”. The round generally only involves one funding model, but isn’t limited to one.

Arbitrum Grants Powered by Impact Evaluations
This proposal presents a novel funding model for Arbitrum Grants that aims to create a scalable, plural, and transparent system for grant distribution that fosters innovation and rewards hard work.

Key Points

Size funding rounds based on the L2’s economic activity; hold larger grant rounds during periods of lower TVL and transaction activity
Divide each round into 3-5 funding pools for different prioritized ecosystem growth areas
Require projects to submit structured data that facilitates permissionless observation of their activity and impact
Incentivize impact evaluators to review structured project data and submit a recommended percentage of funding for each project
Shift the role of delegates from voting on projects to voting on impact evaluators’ scoring of all eligible projects


Round Sizing Formula
Size grant rounds based on ecosystem economic activity over a time period, i.e., a function that considers $ARB’s total value locked and network transaction activity. More $ARB should be granted during bearish or low activity cycles, i​​ncentivizing and supporting hard work during challenging times.

Funding Pool Parameters
Establish distinct funding pools to support development and growth at different network levels, e.g., separate “infrastructure” and “onboarding” pools. We propose leveraging Gitcoin’s Round Manager, with an initial 3-5 funding pools, including one for individual contributions.

Project Eligibility Requirements
Require grant applicants to provide structured project data that facilitates permissionless observation, including Github repos, social media handles, project wallets, and deployed smart contracts. We propose using Gitcoin Passport to prevent application spam, and the hypercert schema to enumerate contributors, work scopes, and work periods. By implementing these standardized measures, we enhance transparency and evaluation of project eligibility.

Impact Evaluation
Allocate a fixed percentage of each funding pool for decentralized impact evaluators. An “impact evaluator” takes as inputs a set of eligible projects and returns a recommended percentage of funding for each project. Evaluators are expected to rely on open data feeds to assess the eligible projects and submit auditable scoring functions alongside their recommendations. We propose dedicating 10% of funding initially to encourage building and innovation in this area.

Funding Decisions
Delegates make funding decisions by voting on impact evaluators instead of projects. This elevates Arbitrum delegates to address the meta problem of signaling which types of impact they value the most. As the ecosystem grows and diversifies, the work of impact evaluators becomes increasingly valuable to delegates’ network and social capital, resulting in a more scalable and effective system.",4

Jokerace Proposal


Grant Ships Game
This proposal is submitted by DAO Masons, a new service DAO committed to “Helping DAOs Win”. We are a small team of governance enthusiasts who design and implement DAO governance systems. Learn more about us at daomasons.com

Abstract

Grant Ships is an ‘evolutionary grants game’ where Grant Ships (grant-giving subDAOs) compete to best deploy capital in the Arbitrum ecosystem.
The goal is to continually improve how we allocate capital by learning which Ship models are most effective, who the talented actors are, and which allocations resonate with Arbitrum voters.

How it works
The game begins with the election and funding of 6 Grant Ships and a small Referee Team.
At the beginning of each funding season, the Grant Ships are given capital from a common funding pool. For the bulk of each season, Grant Ships are busy screening applications, distributing funds, and reporting results. At the end of each season, each ship produces a Portfolio Report to communicate its progress.
The Arbitrum community then ranks the Grant Ships through a weighted token vote. In the following season, high-performing Ships receive a larger portion of the funding pool, and lower-performing ships receive less.
Inactive Ships or Ships that fail to meet minimum criteria can be replaced by new teams looking to enter the game.
The Referee Team facilitates the game and monitors the Ships’ compliance with reporting requirements by flagging rule violations.

819×532 96.1 KB


Strengths
Pluralistic Design
Pluralism is our primary design consideration. Nearly all of the coordination, creativity, and decision-making is left up to the individual Grant Ships.
Capture Resistance
This game decomposes the traditional, centralized grants-giving committee pattern and distributes power and responsibility among Grant Ships, Referees, and the voting community - each serving as a check and balance on the others.
Accountability
Each Grant Ship is incentivized to monitor, document, and report on progress made by grant recipients. Grant recipients are incentivized to produce results and disclose progress to receive more funding in the following season.
Voter Participation
This game is a spectator sport, designed to be fun to play and watch. This is necessary to ensure the ecosystem stays involved and provides the right incentives and signals.
Adaptive Approach
Through token-weighted voting, Arbitrum DAO creates the selective pressure that forces Grant Ships to evolve. As Arbitrum evolves, so will its grants program.

Tools Needed

Weighted Token Voting Module (could be used in the temp-check phase with Snapshot)
Hats Protocol for building the game’s decentralized permission structure (more details here)
EAS or similar attestation model for ‘Flags’
Gnosis Safe for referee operations multisig


Final Thoughts
This is a new system that we designed from scratch – which is hard to get across in a two-minute read. For more reasoning and specifics, please read more in our FAQ.",5

14560,DisruptionJoe,2023-05-26 15:28:06,"Yes! I’ve drafted a proposal which I hope to share on the forum next week. It is on it’s second draft. I’m starting to socialize it to many top delegates to incorporate feedback before a public posting.
Here is the TL;DR:
The proposal aims to immediately begin funding ecosystem development while establishing a decentralized and pluralistic grants framework which is capture-resistant. It requests 5m ARB which is approximately 0.1% of the total treasury. The project will be led by Plurality Labs, a new entity created by Disruption Joe, former Fraud Detection & Defense workstream lead for Gitcoin.
If successful, this project will:

Immediately increase development building Arbitrum-native applications & protocols
Discover our Mission, Vision, Values in a DAO native, bottoms-up way
Ensure Arbitrum is first choice for program managers using Gitcoin (vs another L2)
Decentralize an onchain grant allocation mechanism to be capture-resistant

Progressively decentralized over three milestones


Establish a set cadence for the community to reliably participate in sense-making
Make governance fun and grow governance participation a key metric

14713,Yuhana,2023-06-01 05:34:45,"After launching its mainnet last year, Arbitrum has seen success as an Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 solution.
Arbitrum has focused on providing investors with a cheap, fast and scalable network, elements that Ethereum is still struggling with despite its Merge upgrade in September 2022.
As a result, developers have flocked to Arbitrum to build decentralised applications (dApps), and it is now ranked the seventh biggest blockchain by total value locked (TVL), according to DeFi Llama.
There is now speculation that Arbitrum will release its own ARBI cryptocurrency, but users are awaiting confirmation from the network.
Before exploring its potential cryptocurrency, let’s first look at an Arbitrum definition.
What is Arbitrum?
The Arbitrum network is a layer-2 functionality, developed by the New York-based company Offchain Labs, which seeks to solve the congestion that the Ethereum network has been experiencing by improving how smart contracts are validated.
The platform leverages the security provided by the Ethereum mainnet but allows smart contracts to run on a separate layer to reduce congestion within the network.
This technique is called ‘transaction rollups’ (explained in some detail by the developers here) and consists of batches of transactions and records that are validated on the lower layer to then be moved to layer-1’s mainnet – in this case, the Ethereum mainnet.
Arbitrum compensates nodes that actively validate the smart contracts powered by the Arbitrum chain (known as aggregators) with ETH and they are responsible for adding the blocks to the first layer – the Ethereum mainnet.
How does Arbitrum work?
The Arbitrum One ecosystem is a layer-2 mainnet which powers smart contracts that will later be validated by the Ethereum network (layer-1).
Fees charged by Arbitrum will be paid in ETH and the development team expects a reduction of around 50 times the usual fees paid per transaction on layer-1. This means that it should be cheaper to run Arbitrum smart contracts than to run them on the ETH mainnet directly.
On 29 May 2021, Arbitrum launched its Beta version and quickly attracted the interest of DeFi app developers, who are constantly seeking to reduce the fees that users incur for using the Ethereum network at peak times.
There is now a bustling ecosystem of dApps on Arbitrum, whether it’s the decentralised exchange (DEX) GMX or liquidity management platform DeFiEdge.
Arbitrum has also seen a range of upgrades to its protocol. Its Arbitrum Nitro update went live in August 2022, which improved throughput and interoperability.",1
14693,brianfakhoury,2023-05-30 15:36:25,"Hello, Arbitrum Community!
I am thrilled to propose a new and exciting project that I believe will not only bring us closer as a community but also serve as a valuable resource for all Arbitrum enthusiasts - the “Arbitrum Almanac”. Inspired by the collaborative and decentralized ethos of the Arbitrum protocol, this project aims to create a comprehensive, community-driven almanac that encapsulates the essence of Arbitrum.
Drawing inspiration from projects like the Carbon Almanac, the Arbitrum Almanac will be a testament to the power of decentralized collaboration and knowledge creation. It will contain everything from technical explanations and use-cases to historical milestones and future projections, all curated and contributed by you, the community members.
But why stop there? The Carbon Almanac also hosts a series of podcasts where volunteers share their insights and experiences while working on the project. Imagine an “Arbitrum Almanac Collective Podcast” where we, the creators and users of Arbitrum, discuss our work, share our ‘aha’ moments, and talk about the future of this revolutionary protocol. This could be a platform for us to share ideas, perspectives, and things we can actually do to make a difference in (and with) crypto.
This is an opportunity for us to pool our knowledge, experiences, and perspectives to create a resource that is as diverse and dynamic as the community itself. Whether you’re a developer, a user, or simply an enthusiast, your insights are valuable and can help shape this almanac.
I look forward to gauging interest and hearing thoughts, ideas, and suggestions on how we can make this project a reality.",1

14685,Purshing,2023-05-29 03:05:49,"Outside of participating in the governance. It is cool, but I cannot imagine risking money in a token that won’t generate revenue in a way or another as the network grows.
Huge PS :
Please exclude law and governments, from the topic. Anyone can create a chain where they don’t care having a token being considered as a security by this or that country and build a superior network : not choosing the best for a chain because of this goes directly against the principle of decentralization and permissionless. In that case one shall just build a faster/cheaper centralized network, as you never know what the law will be tomorrow. It is not a question I ask to lawyer/politician, but to economist/scientist/builders. Thank you.",1
14685,DrMath.eth,2023-05-29 05:36:38,"Great question. A fair economic motivation could be the speculation of potential future profits from the token. Unlike other unsustainable projects where you’re provided with an API via artificial staking receiving the same token that’s depreciating in value,I rather be a part of a project whose incentives go beyond pump and bumb with the stress of sell before the project implodes.
Besides, the value of Arbitrum as a technology will remain or increase as long as a decentralized governance is taking the control. This is a point that people often miss: the true potential of this technology is realized only when it’s decentralized. That’s why, besides attracting token holders who speculate with the token value, it’s equally important to engage users who are interested in participating in the governance, thereby contributing value to the ecosystem. This value will stem from a real economy rather than just speculative activities, influencing the value of the token itself. This could even foster incentives for holders to retain their tokens rather than selling them.",2
14685,brianfakhoury,2023-05-30 15:09:32,"While it doesn’t much to do directly with law, there is a throughline: promises are very hard to make and keep in a fully decentralized and permissionless manner. This is the promise of crypto networks though in the long run, so you’re right in looking to whatever is built into the rules of the network regardless of the law of the land.
In order to pass revenue to the token and be more than just a smart contract on Ethereum mainnet though, Arbitrum has a long way to go (1). However, speculators can project forward, and imagine the case for why the community will have to move toward a profit-sharing model once it’s possible and competitive to do so. Going off this thought experiment then, the presence of future cashflows is a reason to value the token above pure governance value.

Is there a way to check its airdrop eligibility without connecting the wallet, just with the address?


Yes! You can check your airdrop without connecting your wallet by copying the url below and typing your address in after the “=” at the end:
https://arbitrum.foundation/eligibility?address=
Before you press enter, get ready to quickly take a screenshot, as the screen will only appear for a second before disappearing and taking you to the arbitrum foundation homepage. If you miss your chance to get a screenshot and have trouble getting it to load again, open an “incognito window” and try again.
Once you have a screenshot, just paste into paint and look how much it’s eligible for at your leisure



 404SeedNotFound:

If I can prove its my wallet (I can login to an exchange and show I initially funded it and have access to the other wallets it sent/received from), is there any chance I could claim that airdrop and have it sent to a different address?


Unfortunately, I think it is doubtful this is possible :(. I don’t think the arbitrum foundation has the customer service capacity to verify individuals ownership of accounts they are unable to access. Of course, you can contact the team directly via twitter or something along those lines, but I wouldn’t put too much weight in this working out.

I don’t know of anything like this, but I love the idea. If it doesn’t exist, I might try to create something like this.
I DO know that certain wallets will kind of help you finish words when you try to import wallets using a phrase (kind of how google will predict what you are typing when you search). Try importing the phrase using a bunch of different wallets, maybe one of their prediction algorithms will help you recover your wallet. When you try this, make sure to actually type the words rather than copy/pasting, since they will not be able to predict anything if words are pasted.",3

3819,alliestokes013,2023-03-17 09:53:34,"Arbitrum is a layer-two scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to increase transaction speed and reduce fees on the Ethereum network. It was developed by Offchain Labs, a blockchain research and development company, and launched in August 2021.
At its core, Arbitrum is a sidechain that operates in parallel to the Ethereum mainnet. It allows users to move their tokens and execute smart contracts on the sidechain, while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. This is achieved through the use of a unique technology called Optimistic Rollups, which allows transactions to be processed off-chain and then verified on-chain.
The result is a significant improvement in transaction speed and cost, with users able to benefit from near-instant transaction confirmation times and significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum’s mainnet. In addition, developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) on Arbitrum with minimal changes to their existing codebase.
One of the key advantages of Arbitrum is that it is fully compatible with Ethereum’s existing ecosystem. This means that users can seamlessly move their tokens and smart contracts between the two networks, making it easy to access the benefits of Arbitrum without having to learn a new platform or technology.
Arbitrum has quickly gained popularity in the Ethereum community, with a growing number of dApps and projects adopting it as their preferred scaling solution. Some of the most popular dApps currently running on Arbitrum include Uniswap, SushiSwap, and Aave, among others.
Overall, Arbitrum represents a significant step forward in the development of the Ethereum ecosystem, providing a scalable, low-cost solution that can help to unlock the full potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain applications. As the platform continues to grow and evolve, it will be interesting to see how it shapes the future of the blockchain industry. ",1

13871,Frisson,2023-04-14 18:36:07,"No DAO is perfect, but I would argue that the Arbitrum DAO is extremely well-designed and valuable. I think this is an important long-term bullish driver for Arbitrum. We should actively seek to export the beneficial qualities of the DAO to projects in the ecosystem, because it will make Arbitrum grow even faster.
What are the beneficial qualities of the Arbitrum DAO?

Revenue from the sequencer flows into the onchain treasury, which the DAO controls.
Protocol upgrades are controlled by the DAO.
There are safety mechanisms built in (e.g. Security Council) that are appropriate for the maturity of the technology, and (critically) these safety mechanisms are controlled by the DAO.
There is a robust social layer that informs onchain governance via Discourse and Snapshot.
There is a foundation that can move quickly on strategic opportunities that are hard to address via DAO governance, and (critically) this foundation is controlled by the DAO.
The token distribution was fair, recognizing all contributing parties to Arbitrum, allowing for legitimate community control, and aligning the incentives of projects involved in the ecosystem.

I would like to see Arbitrum’s DAO model replicated into the rest of the ecosystem. Today, many of the largest projects on Arbitrum are operated in a somewhat less-than-optimal fashion, without all of the beneficial characteristics described above.
I propose an initiative to support Arbitrum DAOs in transitioning to more robust governance. Anyone interested in working with me on this?",1

You have a point!
In the ecosystem, many DAOs weren’t decentralized at all and much tokenomics are only good for funders, but we alsa have some successful examples.
Maker DAO for instance. They created a stablecoin (DAI) that endured market crashes and developed a complex structure. Now, they propose an endgame plan we should follow to learn from their hits and fails.
I agree that projects on ARB should embrace Arbitrum’s values, and we can promote initiatives in that direction. However, we need to be patient because changes like this takes time and starts with shifting people’s mindset.

I’m hoping to start a discussion around creating long term sustainable revenue for the DAO. Right now there is $2M in ETH sitting in a DAO controlled address as a result of sequencer revenue. I’d like to converse about:

Ways to increase this revenue / if we want to.
How these funds might one day be used.

There are two potential methods for the DAO to increase sequencer revenue:

Update the sequencer to a MEV collecting address (many methods this might be implemented to create value for ARB).
Increase the cost of transacting on the L2 in order to increase the delta between L2 fees and cost to post call data to the L1.

The revenue can be used for countless potential ideas: public goods funding, return to token holders, protocol owned liquidity, incentives and so much more.
Lets chat! ",1
13763,swmartin19,2023-04-11 17:49:29,"To point number 1, I don’t think it would be wise to have a centralized sequencer extract MEV for regulatory reasons, and there is no battle tested infra for shared/decentralized sequencers at the moment. I also don’t think optimism extracts MEV yet given their sequencer is also centrally operated, so this could worsen the user experience on Arbitrum. My gut says hold off on MEV extraction for now.
To point number 2, I would support an increase in L2 fees to get a head start on building up a war chest of ETH. If the DAO is likely to support retroactive airdrops with the foundation’s allocated tokens (this is likely, imo), I think this would be an especially great idea as it would put most of the burden on airdrop farmers that are ultimately extracting from our ecosystem.
A unique idea the comes to mind for Arbitrum would be to use the ETH that accrues from the increase in L2 fees to bootstrap an LSD. The Arbitrum DAO would constantly be accruing ETH staking rewards to the treasury. Some other off the cuff ideas to incentivize this LSDs use would be supporting it as a gas token, using ARB as token incentives to mint the LSD, bootstrapping DAO-owned-liquidity on a ETH/[insert LSD] pair to generate more revenue and ensure strong peg strength, etc. This is obviously just an idea and would need a lot more research… but fun to brain storm nonetheless!",2
13763,Frisson,2023-04-11 17:53:51,"Love this topic. Few understand how valuable this continuous source of ETH revenue is to the DAO.
With that said, a few initial thoughts:

Nitro is by far the most efficient tech in the ecosystem. This probably creates some room to theoretically increase fees.
I believe we should be thinking about the future when EIP 4844 has been implemented and design fees for that paradigm (also probably is bullish for our ability to increase fees).
I think we should always aim to be building our ETH stack over time. In my opinion, ETH is the most bullish asset in the world and it’s great for the DAO to have a healthy stack. It also gives the DAO optionality for spending without selling ARB. This would still leave room to spend ETH, because the sequencer is bringing in so much new ETH over time.
We should start looking into opportunities to stake ETH. This could be a bit tricky given that the DAO is on Arbitrum. Maybe we can do some kind of partnership with a group like RocketPool to build out infra with us?

 MattOnChain:

Increase the cost of transacting on the L2 in order to increase the delta between L2 fees and cost to post call data to the L1.


I am also in support of this, and think that it would be great if we also considered using some of the added fees for supporting projects in the ecosystem.

While most of this discussion has occurred on platforms like ethresearch.ch and Flashbots, transitioning this conversation to the governance forum is a step in the right direction.
However, approaching MEV from the perspective of “maximization then utilization” represents just one point in the potential solution space. I believe this approach may not be the optimal solution, as it could create adverse incentives between users and the chain in the long run.
Preliminary revenue estimates place the L2 sequencer at approximately $100 million per year. This substantial sum will likely continue to grow as more users join the network. Consequently, addressing questions like “Should Arbitrum invest in R&D on MEV-minimization technologies?” may become increasingly challenging.
In light of these considerations, I urge caution when examining MEV in the context of an L2 and its sequencer.",9

Ways of increasing the revenue could consist of

PBS where MEV either flows directly to toke holders, or rather is burned from the total token supply. I prefer the burn as it likely looks better from a regulator standpoint and benefits all holders alike.
Scalar multiple. Applying some multiple to the estimated gas fees paid to the L1. We will likely need to wait until post EIP-4844 before figuring out the specs for this implementation, but as L1 blob fees become 10x cheaper than they currently are, there is plenty of room to use a scalar multiple to generate higher margins per transaction while the user still pays much less than they currently do.

Distributing that revenue

Public goods funding. While Arbitrum is still early stage tech, its imperative that the network fund initiatives that push the network forward. Particularly, this should go towards cases that aren’t particularly easy to monetize from outside sources, but provide outsixed benefit to the network
Return to token holders. Token holders do have distinct power of the wallet address containing sequencer reveneu. As a result, they could vote to return this value to token holders. This could be given out automatically to anyone holding the token, or could be to those who stake their ARB, whether in a PoS type system for a decentralized sequencer, or rather just a lockup.
Liquidity incentives. Depending on Arbitrum’s goals from a liquidity and adoption standpoint, it could be a good idea to use ARB as incentives for particular network behavior. Whether that’s providing liquidity on DEXs, trading volume on perps, or other particular metrics, using revenue to facilitate desired activities could be beneficial for the network.

I’m glad you’re getting this discussion started, and I hope to play a key role in facilitating how cash flow is managed for the Arbitrum DAO.",12
13763,MattOnChain,2023-04-25 15:30:30,"With FIFO ordering MEV is still extracted from users, it’s just a latency and colocation game.

@kydo - I believe this approach may not be the optimal solution, as it could create adverse incentives between users and the chain in the long run. what if maximized sequencer revenue and retuned its proceeds to users? Not out of the question imo. In light of these considerations, I urge caution when examining MEV in the context of an L2 and its sequencer.

Understanding Maritime Law:
In most developed nations, maritime law follows a separate code and is an independent jurisdiction from national laws.

Take ETH staking as an example, assume 20% of token holders will stake their tokens, and earn an APY of 4%, and the staking incentives last for 3 months, token required will be:
1.275B x 20% x 4% x 0.25 = 2.55 Million tokens

Regarding the 750m tokens for Arbitrum Foundation, its not an unreasonable proposal. As the team have said in their clarification, many token foundations have big allocations. Polygon is able to partner with big web2 companies like Starbucks and Nike and pay to get projects like DeGods to Polygon chain. These cant be done without ample funds at their disposal. Polygon controls a huge % of their token supply and there is no DAO, none of the decisions are subject to oversight. All the decisions are made by the team in centralized manner. The same can be said about any other sizeable project in the Defi/web3 space. Its the norm, and not the exception in today’s web3 state.
Another L2 chain, ImmutableX has also been making big payments to companies like GameStop. ImmutableX gave GameStop $100m IMX tokens to further the adoption of ImmutableX.
Immutable granted 56,209,850 IMX tokens, just to one web2 company GameStop to make a partnership.
https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/static-files/713417ad-e18f-4f2c-bc1c-312f536d8b36
As soon as GameStop received the tokens, they dumped a third of it.



Decrypt – 4 Feb 22



GameStop Dumps $47M in Immutable X Tokens Following Ethereum NFT Marketplace...
IMX is down 23% over the last 24 hours as GameStop cashes in a significant chunk of its token grant after yesterday’s announcement.





These are business decisions that are required if any web3 project has to grow today by creating fruitful partnerships with web2 companies.
Similarly, even Optimism Foundation is well funded and they are able to get partners like Coinbase.
Do we wish to see Arbitrum not have any future growth? No.
Crypto especially L2 space is fast heating up with heavy competition. Many projects are in the space trying to tie up web2 companies to move to web3, launch NFTs, tokens, use dapps etc.
Arbitrum is already in partnership with big companies like Reddit.
These things cost a lot of funds to nurture and grow. One cannot immediately put a fixed cost on nurturing such partnerships over the long term. Usually, they are the result of several weeks or months of work, backed by a team that does not have financial constraints.
Presently, Arbitrum is the 4th largest DeFi project in terms of TVL, only behind Ethereum, BSC and Tron. If we have to grow this even further, the Foundation must be able to bring in the kind of partnerships and adoption that other teams like Polygon, Immutable, Avalanche etc are able to get.
Considering these and the need to bring about adoption of Arbitrum chains, so that the Arbitrum DAO can eventually benefit, the 750m token grant to Arbitrum Foundation is not unreasonable. Arbitrum DAO at present controls 42% of the total token supply in its treasury. Making the 750m token grant to  seed Arbitrum Foundation will bring Arbitrum DAO Treasury’s holdings down to ~34% while Arbitrum Foundation will be in a strong position for few years to grow the network, onboard well known partners to the Arbitrum ecosystem and bring about wide adoption of the network, which will benefit the Arbitrum DAO immensely.
The opposition towards the 750m funding to seed Arbitrum Foundation seems to be misplaced. At the moment, many competitors are using this occasion to attack Arbitrum, while they themselves have a big centralized treasury that they control and use to onboard partners. If Arbitrum Foundation is not well funded, the Arbitrum chains and networks will be left behind completely and Arbitrum DAO as a whole will suffer.
However, the main things needed from the team are transparency around actual unlocked token at present, future unlocks and transparency on how they intend to use the 750m tokens. They cannot just claim the tokens are locked, then the community finds out that its not actually locked but has been sold. That is a bad situation that must be completely avoided.",1

They literally subverted the DAO by moving tokens before there was even a vote offered. This is a fact and not FUD. Being complacent is dangerous and every one who voted against this had the same exact concerns.
I love the concept of DAOs, but the people who voted for this and people who say this is FUD are simply not mature enough to have a say in regards to just handing over a billion dollars to complete strangers.",2
13082,enzo7,2023-04-03 10:23:10,"
handing over a billion dollars to complete strangers.

They are not complete strangers. This is fraudulent and dangerous narrative being pushed here.
The team built the project from scratch and grew the TVL to $2-3 billion, and then airdropped $1.5 bn worth tokens to the community. How are they complete strangers to the very project they created? Just ridiculous.
Thats how every other project did too. When you claimed Optimism airdrop, you simply accepted that the Optimism Foundation gets billion dollars worth tokens. There was no vote for that.
People who are spreading FUD are the ones who are simply not mature enough to understand how DAOs work and the requirements of web3 at present. This is the problem with DAOs - random people try to dictate terms, subverting those who actually built the project, who know whats required to take it to the next level. Here, the Arbitrum team is “strangers” while airdrop bag holders are dictating the terms lol.
When you say you love DAO, thats the problem - people want responsibility without offering anything in return. When the team itself proposes a Foundation allocation to further grow the project, everyone is up in arms and preventing the project from growing. This is one of the reasons airdrops are a failed model - way too many people with entitlement and nothing else try to dictate terms.
Projects that never had an airdrop like Polygon, Avalanche, Solana all have foundations with a ton of tokens, and all these Foundations spend their tokens in whatever way they see fit, without any community vote and no DAO that tries to sandbag any reasonable proposal.
Arbitrum’s fault is they literally put it to a community vote, instead of taking the Foundation tokens right at the start like Optimism did.",3

6310,khalabbil,2023-03-19 18:28:55,"Arbitrum’s commitment to Ethereum compatibility is a key factor that sets it apart from other Layer 2 scaling solutions. The Nitro technology that powers this compatibility is a cutting-edge innovation that allows users and developers to experience the benefits of Arbitrum with minimal disruption to their existing workflows. In this article, we will delve deeper into the Nitro technology and explore how it facilitates seamless Ethereum compatibility for Arbitrum.
Nitro: The Core of Ethereum Compatibility
At the heart of Arbitrum’s Ethereum compatibility is Nitro, a groundbreaking approach that utilizes a modified version of Geth, the most widely-used Ethereum implementation. By basing Nitro on Geth, Arbitrum is able to ensure that most of the code running within its Layer 2 environment is identical to that of the Layer 1 Ethereum network. This means that users and developers can continue to use their favorite Ethereum wallets, libraries, and tools when interacting with Arbitrum, making the transition to this Layer 2 solution as smooth as possible.
The Benefits of Nitro
There are several advantages to using Nitro as the foundation for Arbitrum’s Ethereum compatibility. These include:

Familiarity: By maintaining compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and libraries, Nitro enables developers to leverage their existing knowledge and experience when building and deploying smart contracts on Arbitrum. This reduces the learning curve and allows for faster adoption of the Layer 2 solution.
Reduced Friction for Users: With Nitro, users can interact with Arbitrum using their preferred Ethereum wallets, minimizing the need for additional setup or configuration. This makes it easy for users to take advantage of the lower fees and faster transaction times offered by Arbitrum without having to change their habits or learn new tools.
Enhanced Security: By basing Nitro on Geth, Arbitrum can inherit the security features and improvements of the Ethereum ecosystem. As Ethereum continues to evolve and strengthen its security, Arbitrum can benefit from these advancements as well.
Cross-Chain Compatibility: Nitro’s compatibility with Ethereum opens the door to cross-chain interoperability, allowing users and developers to interact with multiple blockchains seamlessly. This can lead to the creation of new, innovative decentralized applications that can leverage the strengths of different blockchain networks.

In conclusion, Nitro is a vital component of Arbitrum’s Ethereum compatibility, enabling users and developers to experience the advantages of this Layer 2 scaling solution without disrupting their existing workflows. By leveraging a modified version of Geth, Nitro ensures that the transition to Arbitrum is as seamless as possible, fostering rapid adoption and unlocking the potential for new, innovative decentralized applications.",1
