14299,Arbitrum,2023-05-03 20:58:02,"The community is encouraged to discuss ideas such as grant categories, forming committees to evaluate proposals, and creating a more open-door policy for conversations. This is an open discussion, and more input is welcome.
This discussion forum was created based on community feedback, with the purpose of providing the DAO with a place to discuss opinions, draft guidelines, and facilitate constructive conversations among everyone at a single location. As it currently stands, all access to the DAO Treasury (regardless of amount) requires completion of an AIP and the process described in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution. This process is designed to take time and require extensive community support before being approved, which can make it difficult for smaller requests that would still benefit the Arbitrum eco-system to receive funding. As we have seen within the community, there has already been lively discussion on how best to address this concern and empower our community towards the best outcomes for Arbitrum. Ultimately, the existence and structure of a DAO-supported grants program is for the community to decide, and this forum is merely to support this process.
It is also important to note that there are legal requirements such as “Know your Customer” (KYC) procedures that have to be completed before funds can be distributed by the DAO Treasury. All proposals can enlist the Arbitrum Foundation to take on the KYC and legal requirements to assist the DAO so that the funds can be safely released.
Finally, it is also relevant to note that the Foundation will be operating a separate and independent grant program. This program will complement any community-led program(s) that are created and will provide additional resources for the development of the ecosystem. More details will be released about this program.
Thank you for your participation!",1

The Opportunity
The global gaming industry is massive. With over 3 billion global gamers (1 in every 2.36 people) and ~$184b in revenue (2023) being driven across the global games market, there is a massive opportunity ahead for the web3 gaming space.
While web3 gaming is still in its infancy, Arbitrum has a unique opportunity to immediately acquire promising builders through a combination of grant allocation and a support network led by experts.
There are several key points leading us to this hypothesis:

Gaming is an easy win for Arbitrum; all the ingredients for success are present. There just needs to be a catalyst to ignite a snowball effect and draw the attention of talented game builders.

Arbitrum currently ranks #7 in total games among network competitors, despite minimal incentives → highlighting that builders have chosen to build on Arbitrum primarily for its merits across technology, liquidity, and access to users
Launch of Arbitrum Orbit and Stylus are additional pieces of critical infrastructure that should attract game builders which, in turn, will increase the number of quality games


The gaming audience is immense, and capturing a fraction of that traffic for web3 within the Arbitrum ecosystem could yield exponential ROI

Industry is currently sized at $272 billion in 2024, and is projected to hit $426 billion by 2029
User base exceeds 3 billion as of 2022


Gamers coming on-chain to Arbitrum will bring a net benefit for all protocols:

The majority of gamers are in the 18-34 year old range, prime for DeFi and typically early adopters of technology


Now is the time to act - gaming infrastructure is maturing, and growth is poised for networks that are ready to support web3 gaming:

“2024 is a growth year in terms of bringing people on to Web3,” Yat Siu (Animoca Games)
Dmitrii Morozov, CEO of GG MetaGame, notes: “The groundwork laid in 2022 and 2023 with alpha and beta stages is coming to fruition, with many titles set for commercial release in 2024, potentially bringing Web3 gaming to new heights.”



Background
The STIP process kicked off various discovery efforts to better support gaming and position the Arbitrum ecosystem for success. As part of these efforts, various builders and gaming experts shared content to help frame the opportunity and also educate the DAO on the standards, ecosystem, and processes that support game development.
One of the first DAO discussions on gaming was presented at an open delegate call focused on gaming, with @karelvuong from Treasure sharing his experiences around building Arbitrum’s gaming ecosystem from the ground up. @Soby from XAI also provided some perspective on why Arbitrum was their destination of choice despite having great working relationships with other chains.
In the above discussions and numerous other DAO related conversations on how we can grow gaming, it is abundantly clear that gaming could provide numerous benefits to the Arbitrum ecosystem as detailed further in the Appendix.
Data across the competitive landscape pointed to several insights:

Leaders and major L2/L1 competitors are aggressively pursuing games and other ecosystem builders with budgets of $100-500 million in grants and other incentives - this was recently showcased with multiple networks pursuing Treasure DAO in their L3 search
Arbitrum is the L2 leader in DeFi but ranks below major network competitors across gaming presence metrics and gaming migration.
Development expenses for Web3 games are anticipated to match or surpass those of comparable Web2 games. This is attributed to the overarching requirement for parity in game quality, compounded by an absence of a defined playbook for marketing and user acquisition, along with a negative stigma among traditional gamers.
The game publisher model, in which publishers provide funding and dedicated hands-on support to game builders, has the potential to catalyze and accelerate growth of web3 gaming on Arbitrum.
Arbitrum DAO’s early focus and current makeup that skews towards decentralized finance was great, but has meant DAO programs often did not account for specific needs of gaming projects.

These insights are further illustrated in the Appendix section below. They point to a need to aggressively grow the Arbitrum gaming ecosystem through support for current and new gaming projects and studios – with the guidance and dedicated resources of experts already working to grow Arbitrum’s dominance in gaming (publishers, game developers, etc.).
Throughout the following months, builders continued to share about their experiences and present gaming topics to the DAO for the purpose of education:

Macro Landscape & Arbitrum’s Peers
Despite Arbitrum’s leadership as the de facto home for decentralized trading with its recent accolades and position leading bridged $ETH and DEX volume, it is still lagging when it comes to gaming.
Arbitrum’s Gaming Presence Across Web3 Networks
Game7 Research published a report covering the State of Web3 Gaming in 2023 on October 15, 2023, and the results are telling. Arbitrum falls in the middle of the pack across several indicators with a gap that will continue to widen unless bold and decisive action is taken.
At the time of the report, Arbitrum was the 7th largest ecosystem by number of games, trailing the likes of Polygon, Solana, Immutable and Avalanche. While the quantity of games in itself is not a meaningful indicator of success, it signals that Arbitrum is experiencing challenges with game acquisition. In addition to attracting new games, it’s imperative to track player adoption and employ quality controls as other metrics of success.
Many of Arbitrum’s peer ecosystems have dedicated gaming arms and incentives used to attract game studios to build on their network, often managed by the associated network’s foundation entity with meaningful agency and capital to deploy towards gaming projects. Fortunately, the Arbitrum DAO is armed with the necessary funds, and is capable of deploying them in a manner that meaningfully impacts the network’s growth. 1600×901 169 KB
Gaming Within Ethereum Layer 2 Landscape
Within the Ethereum L2 landscape itself, Immutable has the pole position with 75% more games building on the network when compared to Arbitrum. While there is a relatively steep drop to third place that tapers off, there has been a concerted effort from other ecosystems to gain ground. The Optimism ecosystem in particular recently hired Ryan Wyatt and Urvit Goel to lead growth and gaming BD. These are the same leaders who are credited with much of Polygon’s early gaming lead as well as the landmark Polygon and Immutable gaming partnership. In short, Arbitrum currently holds second place, but this could change rapidly given the concerted efforts of other chains in growing their gaming presence.

Games Building on Blockchain Frameworks
When it comes to blockchain frameworks (eg. Arbitrum Orbit, OP Stack, Polygon CDK, Avalanche Subnets, etc.), Arbitrum lags in live L3s building atop the stack but comes in fourth in terms of active games. OP Stack currently leads the pack with 25 live networks.
This is not to say Arbitrum is underperforming necessarily. Given the respective launch dates of competitive networks, Arbitrum has shown that even without significant gaming focused marketing or grants, developers are still building new games and migrating from other networks into Arbitrum. This speaks to Arbitrums potential for gaming, especially given its brand recognition, stability, and technology products.
Imagine how the data would look with a significant grant program and experienced publishers working collaboratively with the DAO to source, secure, and market talented teams building upon the Arbitrum network.

Arbitrum has become the de facto king of decentralized finance, but falls far behind in the gaming space - which is both a risk to future network growth and an opportunity to aggressively grow the sector.
About Building Web3 Games
Developing games has incredibly high upside when it comes to potential network effects, but it does come with the risk of being a resource and time intensive endeavor.
This also compounds with the addition of web3 elements. Not only do teams have to create a game that is fun and rewarding, but they must find ways to generate value and integrate complex web3 components that introduce additional risk and resourcing puzzles.
Benefits of Web3
The benefits of web3 in gaming listed below has been pulled and paraphrased from an essay authored by Colleen Sullivan, Co-Head of Ventures at Brevan Howard Digital:

Ownership: Physical and digital experiences have started to blend and we have seen proof points emerge in web2 games that have a perfect use case in web3 as non-fungible assets. If a gamer pays $15 for a skin in Fortnite or Counter-Strike and had the option to own it completely or not, it’s likely they would choose the web3 version of the skin. The same applies in a non-spending context with games like EVE Online, Diablo, or World of Warcraft where items are earned – usually after hours of hard work and grinding. Ownership extends beyond assets though to encompass games themselves in areas of governance as well as creation. Some games also become platforms (ie. Fortnite, Roblox) which allow users to create and contribute user-generated content (UGC). Web3 can allow gamers to have greater ownership in games, contribute to building and extending the game through mods, new game modes, and more.
Composable and Interoperable: In web3, assets (ERC-20s, ERC-721s, and ERC-1155s) as well as smart contracts form building blocks which exist anywhere the internet exists. The dream of “bringing your sword from one game to another game” is a concept that can be brought to life through the power of web3. For games that are build fully on-chain with their game logic built into smart contracts, it allows for the creation of a forever game that exists anywhere the internet exists and doesn’t require centralized servers. For savvy game builders and the right foundation, this allows for new games or expressions to be built atop games. Wallet holdings – which are public – allow for generalized segmentation, allowing builders to port assets and status permissionlessly across games (and beyond as well!).
Onramping Non-Spenders into Game Economies: In traditional games, especially in free-to-play (F2P) games, the lion’s share of players are non-spenders. They might enjoy the game and spend hours in it but they did not spend any money. Per the Newzoo Global Games Market Report 2022, there were ~299 million gamers on console and ~458 million on PC who played but did not spend money. The data is murky on the percentage of gamers who make in-game purchases, but the number 5% is often cited. In web3, if game assets are tokenized and non-spenders are unknowingly introduced to blockchain game economies, wouldn’t it be something if they suddenly became aware that the sword they spent hours grinding to obtain was worth $4,000? Or the token airdrop they received had meaningful value behind it. Non-spender successfully converted.
User-Generated Content (UGC): Blockchains give creators the ability to establish provenance and have digital property rights over the virtual goods they create. These virtual goods could be potentially sold to an eager buyer instantly, effectively enabling UGC on steroids. There has been a growing trend of games moving to Games-as-a-Service or live service models, with many embracing UGC. In these models, contributions of people from all over the world foster network effects and keep content fresh in games.

Cost and Considerations of Game Development
Development Costs
To understand costs surrounding game development, the easiest baseline would be to look at simple digital games from a pure development cost.
Mobile games are often the cheapest, quickest to market games, but also compete in a crowded market. In 2024, the average mobile game costs between $100k-250k, while larger premiere games exceed the $1m mark. Larger, complex triple A titles like Call of Duty often incur costs well above $100m just for development alone.
The cost examples above are without any web3 integrations or components, which can quickly increase costs depending on complexity. For any game with on-chain trading elements, it may be prudent to scope the integration and production of the on-chain building separately. Our estimate is at least a 25-50% increase in costs for web3 development and integration on top of traditional gaming costs.
When looking at the high end of web3 gaming, we can draw some conclusions based on recent launches. Triple A web3 title Shrapnel, launched on the Avalanche network, pulled in two funding rounds and a token sale totaling $37.5m between Series A and Seed funding, and has been in development since at least 2021. However, the game is still in development as of early 2024 and has not released milestones for open beta testing.
While the high capital requirements to build games does not mean that networks should incur 100% of the burden of funding the game development life cycle, in a landscape with aggressive incentives offered by competitive networks and a growing number of talented teams looking for the right ecosystem partner, incentives can make a significant difference for gaming studios.
Development Time
Due to the fast-paced nature of crypto, game developers are encouraged to create value and go-to-market in a shortened timeline compared to the traditional gaming industry. While traditional games in web2 often see development cycles reach 3-5 year mark for larger titles or 1-3 mark for smaller, indie games, the timeline for web3 games is compressed with the emergence of pre-vertical slice game prototypes required to maintain attention and support community engagement post-launch of web3 gaming projects. This means that larger budgets are necessary to maintain quality on accelerated time scales.
Aggressive building means a need for more resources dedicated to development, game design, tokenomics, and user acquisition while also upskilling to incorporate new development paradigms (eg. Solidity and smart contracts) in traditional game development.
Summary of Developer Needs from Chains/Ecosystems

Development
Distribution & Marketing
Liquidity (Players and Capital)
Funding

Incentives and grants are primarily used to support opex, rarely for player redistribution
Given the capital requirements for games and the primary driver for user retention/acquisition being fun - it makes sense to utilize funds for the creation of web3 games as well as onboarding incentives that are more common in DeFi.
Successful games will look different from successful DeFi protocols
Within gaming, there is less focus on yield, being +EV, or value-accrual from trading, and more of a focus on creating an experience that delivers fun and engaging experiences to players. Brand building, fostering a vibrant player community, and forging an emotional connection back to one’s IP is often a priority for titles which adds to the complexity and cost of game building. Beyond the game development process, this necessitates concerted, bespoke efforts towards marketing and creativity that need to be tailored for each individual game.
Current Gaming Landscape on Arbitrum
Despite the lack of targeted incentives for games, the Arbitrum landscape has grown organically and is flourishing across the available ecosystems.
With additional incentives and strong programs like the Gaming Catalyst Program, the current builders and experts can help fuel exponential growth.

The Role of Game Publishers
Game publishers and gaming ecosystems play a crucial role in the gaming industry by providing teams with a range of benefits that often help to accelerate and further the chances of success for game developers, including but not limited to:

Financial Support: Game development is a resource-intensive process, and publishers can provide the necessary funding for developers. This financial support often covers development costs, marketing expenses, and other operational needs, typically in exchange for future economic incentives and alignment through revenue sharing
Expertise and Guidance: Publishers typically have experienced teams with expertise in various aspects of game development, including design, marketing, distribution, and monetization. They can offer valuable guidance to developers, helping them navigate challenges and make informed decisions throughout the development process. On the monetization front, publishers can bring valuable insights into effective strategies, including pricing models, in-app purchases, mint strategies, and other revenue streams both in web2 and web3 contexts.
Marketing and Promotion: Publishers excel in marketing and promoting games to a wide audience. They leverage their established networks, relationships, and marketing channels to create awareness for a game through events, media relations, and driving user acquisition through paid marketing.
Distribution Channels: Publishers have established distribution channels, both digital and physical, allowing games to reach a broader audience. This can include partnerships with major distribution platforms (such as Epic Games, Steam, or the mobile app stores), brick-and-mortar retailers, and other distribution networks that help games reach players globally.
Access to Resources: Publishers can provide developers with access to additional resources such as advanced technology, licensing deals, proprietary tools, or quality assurance and playtesting support. This access can accelerate the development process and give studios an edge that otherwise would be difficult or time consuming to build as an independent studio.

Network Dynamics
Other networks have a huge head start on Arbitrum and have made substantial investments towards gaming through the establishment of dedicated gaming teams and a dedicated allocation of funding.
Per the aforementioned research, Arbitrum recently exceeded Ethereum transaction volume on a 24h basis but is currently ranked 7th in terms of games onboarded. Furthermore, the network does not have a formal gaming incentives program like many network peers.
Comparables of gaming-focused grants and incentive programs across select peer networks (excludes generalized incentive programs; ordered by size):

Immutable: $500m Ecosystem Fund from June 17, 2022 (link)
Ronin: 150M RON or ~$280M at time of writing from January 27, 2022 (link)
Avalanche: $220m fund from March 8, 2022 (link)
Polygon: $190M altogether - $100m fund from July 21, 2021 (link) and $90m+ Polygon Village fund from November 9, 2023 (link)
Solana: $150m grant program from November 26, 2022 (link)
Optimism: $2M retroactive grant to on-chain games from January 11, 2024 (link); excludes generalized incentives allocated to the Ecosystem Fund (including the Partner Fund managed by the Optimism Foundation) and RetroPGF

With the majority of the Arbitrum ecosystem’s funds resting in the hands of the DAO, it is imperative that the Arbitrum DAO community mobilizes to seize the opportunity that lies ahead of us to become the web3 ecosystem of choice for games.
Major opportunity for growth with gaming set to onboard the masses
Gaming as a segment is highly retentive and sticky, and represents an opportunity to onboard a new user profile that is not only underrepresented on Arbitrum but who may be new to crypto overall. As an untapped addressable market of users, there’s an opportunity to bring them into web3 through the lens of gaming and sell them on the wonders of the space.

The landscape is beginning to heat up
Still early days in general and is a ripe opportunity that Arbitrum should seize]

1024×576 36.4 KB
Although the average spend per user may be lower, gamers bring mass network activity and attention to ecosystems.
Gaming is a core use case for Arbitrum Stylus and Orbit
With the rollout of Orbit, teams now have a way to create their own L3 ecosystem built on top of powerful Arbitrum network technology. This advantage is perfect for games looking for performance, cheaper transactions, and curated networks customized for their use case.
Stylus opens the doors to thousands of developers coding in other languages to create their games within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The support for C++ brings on a very popular game development language right into EVM compatibility, lowering barriers to entry for game studios that are often staffed with technical teams focused on one developer stack.
Maintaining Arbitrum’s technology lead and proliferating adoption of its products
Arbitrum boasts an impressive set of innovative technology and products through its Orbit stack which allows developers and protocols to inherit improvements such as AnyTrust and other forms of altDA, EVM+ compatibility via Stylus, BOLD’s next generation fraud proofs, and Timeboost. This is all on top of significantly lower fees and faster blocktimes which is very conducive for the gaming use case.
In particular with Stylus, Stylus contracts are over an order of magnitude faster with significantly lower gas fees due to the superior efficiency of WASM programs. Memory is 100-500x cheaper when using Stylus, unlocking new use cases now that consuming RAM is viable on the blockchain. Compared to using Solidity, WASM programs are much more efficient. There are many reasons for this, including the decades of compiler development for Rust and C. WASM also has a faster runtime than the EVM, resulting in faster execution. Generally, a 10x improvement has been seen for contracts using WASM languages compared to contracts using Solidity. Use cases not practical in the EVM are now possible in Stylus. Computation is over 10x improved. Memory is over 100x improved. Cryptography libraries can now be deployed as custom precompiles, permissionlessly. Stylus applied to gaming will be a significant unlock for what will be possible through fully on-chain games and autonomous worlds. The greatest breeding ground for blockchain innovation has arrived.
Overview: The Three Pillars of Building a Successful, Profitable Game
The three pillars are:

Positive unit economics: Per-capita revenue and cost optimization
Scale: Retention and user acquisition
A healthy dose of fun: Engagement

Positive Unit Economics
Reaching positive unit economics means a game needs to make more money from users than they cost to acquire. The two components of positive unit economics:
User Acquisition: Consistently optimizing user acquisition is critical to bring down the cost to acquire users. This means knowing what a user or cohort costs, where exactly they came from and how they engage with game through their full journey (ie. deep funnel).
Lifetime Value (LTV): Diligently optimizing the game to increase LTV is a key to success. Games will never get it right the first time. Build systems (LiveOps, points programs, A/B testing) that allow optimizations to be implemented quickly. Use your system to measure results using statistically significant user cohorts, then implement the best configuration. Repeat … repeat … repeat … and reach the break-even point where your user lifetime value exceeds the cost to acquire them.
1124×856 200 KB
The path to positive unit economics
Scale
Scale is often thought of as user acquisition. This is incorrect: User acquisition is only one part of the equation, but is often a game’s largest liability.
If this equation is not monitored closely and unit economics measured, a game will scale unsustainably, losing money and will not reach profitability.
Scale = Retention x User acquisition
With the proper systems in place, every user that churns is a data point that moves the game closer to profitability. Incremental optimization is how games go from zero to studio hero.
1234×926 185 KB
Retention is a critical component of scaling sustainably
Healthy Dose of Fun
Fun is a requirement for success but on its own is not sustainable. Fun means user engagement; The actions taken or the frequency of play are example measures of fun. The issue with some Web3 games is they inflate these numbers with financial incentives. This makes their numbers look great short term but is unsustainable.
Example: A game reduced the ROI on farmers, did the engagement of regular users decrease? If the answer is yes, that is critical to know. “I should build a feature that offsets the loss in engagement we’ll see when farming gets nerfed.”
Striking a healthy balance between fun and sustainability is critical to have both engagement and profitability.

How to Measure Success in Web3 Gaming
There are several phases to game development that each have their own measurements of success. As a game progresses through the phases of the game lifecycle it’s critical these measurements for success are achieved at each stage.
Phase 1 - Game Development

Functioning core loop
Game systems are configurable
High quality taxonomy implemented
Core understanding of LiveOps and how it will work in the game
Planning user identities and attribution
Plans for monetization

Phase 2 - Alpha/Closed Beta

What systems did not function as expected, including core loop, liveops and monetization systems
Have all dysfunctional systems been restored?
Game stability beyond 99.5%
What is the NPS (net promoter score) from initial users? Is it above 50?

Phase 3 - Open Beta

What are the initial metrics on retention, engagement, and monetization?
Where did drop-off in the user funnels occur?
What exact marketing channel and marketing creative are generating our best users?
A/B testing implemented and successfully deployed
Are the game optimization mechanisms functioning as expected?

Phase 4 - Game Launch

Incremental and measurable improvements with each user acquisition push to both CAC and LTV
Is our break-even point less than 1-year away?
Which user acquisition channels are working and sustainable and which are not
Is the Cost of Acquiring a User coming down over time? Is User Lifetime Value increasing over time?
What percentage of users are payers?
What response are the users demonstrating to features and liveops?
Have we tested our marketing channels to ensure the economics hold true when scale is increased?

Phase 5 - Growth

Are we trending to positive unit economics?
Have we been reliably exceeding our goals for both the cost to acquire users and lifetime value?
Are unit economics holding true as we scale?
Which marketing channels are performing best
What segmented offers and experiences are being implemented
STATS:

ARPDAU
dX retention
Engagement %
Payer Percent
Session length
DOW frequency



Allocated Grants: Performance Based Milestones
It’s important to keep in mind the complexity and scale of games varies game-by-game. Below are ranges based on averages:
Phase 1 - Game Development
This phase is critical where all foundations of the game are set in place and initial benchmarks for performance are established. If the game design and tooling are not setup properly during this phase the game will struggle to reach break-even.
A grant of $100,000 to $1.5M is recommended depending on the scope and state of the project.
Phase 2 + 3 - Alpha/Closed Beta and Open Beta
Phases two and three are intertwined with their shared focuses on refinement and optimization. It’s during these phases that positive unit economics must be achieved before launching and scaling the game.
A grant of $250,000 to $500,000 is recommended which is lower than phase one because this phase is focused on refinement.
Phase 4 + 5 - Game Launch and Growth
These phases are both intertwined as they’re focused on launch and sustainable growth. It’s critical that as the game scales it’s continuously optimized to reduce the cost to acquire users while increasing their lifetime value.
A grant of +$1.5M is recommended which is the highest given the majority is allocated to launch and user acquisition.

Do they all meet this criteria, or just Treasure? Do you have a list of all eligible “Publishers?”

image928×262 28.1 KB



Regarding commercials between Publishers and Game Studios, I see that the DAO is not allowed to be a party to these deals. Still, I think maybe if the DAO is funding the development, they should also have a part of the deal. Can you make it a flat rev share percent for all deals potentially that goes back to the DAO, or maybe some other economics you think make better sense?


I see in terms of the proposal that it is in bad faith for one publisher to chat with Game Studios under another publisher. Still, most of the games seem to already be a part of Treasure, so it may be difficult to find other applicants. What if a few game studios want to merge to form their own Publisher is that allowed? Maybe instead of earmarking it 80/20 publisher vs. indie, do not enforce an earmark so that indies don’t feel pressured that the only way to receive funding is to partner with a publisher.


Those are some initial thoughts I had, will take a look at some of the other ecosystem grant programs this weekend, as the only one I have intimate knowledge of is immutable.",5

You are missing the other bullet point - we adjusted to allow for outside publishers as well if they intend on building within Arbitrum. Also adjusted the qualification to 1 game that is live for Arbitrum Publishers.

That is out of scope on the GCP but is being discussed as a separate initiative (will share soon!)


Game studios can form their own publisher - not an issue at all. The 20% for independent builders is substantial and we felt like it would be better to establish guardrails to set the budget rather than allowing for publishers to obtain even more funding than 80%.


The Ape community is now on Arbitrum, outside publishers looking to build on Arbitrum can also put forth proposals. I see a lot of interest coming from the publisher side which will = more builders.

21270,froggie,2024-02-16 20:01:27,"Great to see a gaming proposal on Arbitrum! I’ve been following this proposal for a little while now and it seems that it has overwhelmingly been created by publishers and there is not yet enough input from existing games in the ecosystem. Three things I immediately notice from this proposal:

The grant for games in Alpha/Closed Beta is much lower than the grant for games in early development or post-launch. I think this is a mistake. A game’s beta is often when it needs to do the most refinement to find product market fit, and ensure that the game loop is enjoyable to play and there are no issues with the game logic. Many games are in their Alpha/Beta stage for multiple years as they refine to a product that is capable of being scaled to the masses.

The following games all had an Alpha/Beta stage longer than a year:
a. Minecraft
b. FortNite
c. PubG Battlegrounds
d. Rust
e. DayZ
f. many, many more
I suggest this grant amount be increased to 1-1.5M. It should also be considered if the Phase 1 should be decreased, as it often takes games much less time to get an alpha phase together than it does to polish the game for full release. Again, see the examples above. The complete game loop for each game is usually completed in the first ~6 months. The Alpha/Beta phase take the longest to get right.


The proposal seems to have a large focus on the importance of Game Ecosystems and Publishers, but it does not make any note as to how much should be given to Ecosystems/Publishers vs. Games themselves. I think this should be made clear in the proposal so Arbitrum users know what they are agreeing to in advance. Also, there seems to be no mention of how much Publishers would be given per game under their ecosystem, and how much of this grant would be expected to be passed on to the game, or any timeframe thereof.


I think the Arbitrum DAO needs to be very careful about giving a very open grant to Game Ecosystems/Publishers, without ensuring a few follow-ups.


As the proposal currently stands, it seems that these grants could be very extractive to the DAO in favor of publishers/ecosystems. This is because the current proposal makes no mention of how much of the grants given to publishers/ecosystems will be required to given to games within their ecosystem or how much of it will be used to grow games on Arbitrum. In addition, there seems to be no lock-in period, meaning these ecosystems/publishers could easily take the growth from this grant and leave Arbitrum to become a competitor to Arbitrum’s existing gaming ecosystem.
We should be very careful to ensure we are incentivizing publishers/ecosystems only to build and grow exceptional games within the Arbitrum ecosystem. In addition, we should be very prudent about making sure the money given to these publishers/ecosystems makes its way to the games in their ecosystem in a timely and efficient manner, such that the grant is actually used to grow the games within Arbitrum rather than just grow the pocketbooks of publishers.
I suggest the following:
a. Any Ecosystem/Publisher and all future games under their ecosystem that receives a grant be required to stay within the Arbitrum ecosystem for 1-2 years, depending on grant size
b. Publishers/Ecosystems receiving a grant must hit specific milestones in terms of passing on the grants they are given to games within their ecosystems. The milestones should have both time and size requirements, based on the original grant size.
c. There should be multiple Phases for Ecosystems/Publishers (and likely Infrastructure), as there are for games. This way Arbitrum can incentivize new Publishers to join the ecosystem and scope the requirements/grants based on the size and Phase of the publisher/ecosystem.
If we can make sure that these things happen, we can guarantee that Arbitrum will become the leading gaming ecosystem for web3. Otherwise, we are mixing incentives and likely to cause future problems between publishers/ecosystems and Arbitrum itself.",13

Speaking as both a game studio dev who’s received grants and having worked previously at Polygon Studio’s gaming BD team, grants can be hugely helpful to onboard gaming studios. Caveat that incentives / milestones need to be structured well 
I also think Arbitrum’s strength in DeFi pairs well with gaming; studios that start building on Arbitrum will want to stay to launch tokens, nfts, etc. which will cultivate additional economic activity beyond the games themselves.",14

First of all thank you for putting up this proposal, it must have been a lot of work.

Arbitrum is one of the strongest L2 with 1.5 million ETH bridged so far.
Arbitrum has one of the strongest Treasury.
Other ecosystems have granted 200-500 million for gaming grants.

These economics are easily exploited.  Players do not have any control over their game assets, on the contrary, any money they put into the game is totally subordinate to the whim of the developer.  Policing the usage of subsidies is difficult for the same reason, as any developer could programmatically drain the rewards of their own game, under the guise of “legitimate” play.

It seems to me that there is one very big problem with web3 gaming.
Big titles are afraid of losing money if they move to web3. They don’t want to spend money on gas, and also want to sell their skins in games separately for different platforms: PC, XBox, PlayStation, Nintendo.
We need to somehow attract big titles to the blockchain",20
21270,divdaurres,2024-02-27 21:45:31,"Hey guys, Diego, founder of The Beacon here.
As one of the pioneer and leading gaming projects on the chain we are on the frontlines. From here we have plenty of exposure to what other chains are doing. It’s important to mention that most chains are moving very quickly and very boldly. They won’t hesitate on deploying resources and trying to secure for themselves the best builders and projects.
Most of the successful launches you’ve seen lately, took place because those chains reached out to the games, not the other way around. These chains know securing good titles is one of the best ways to position themselves as the go-to chains for gaming. We’ve received offers plenty of times ourselves but at The Beacon we believe in Arbitrum’s future and we believe we can create something fantastic in here.
However, if the DAO overlooks what the other chains are doing and ignores their impact on builders you might risk Arbitrum losing much of its web3 gaming momentum.
It’s not a minor proposal I know, and careful evaluation is always desirable.
However by the time the DAO makes up their mind it might be too late. Everyone else is already deploying funds.
We have fantastic projects and quite the good shot in here to secure Arbitrum as one of the go-to chains for gaming. Let’s not waste it.",21
21270,Rinn,2024-02-28 03:38:08,"There is no comparison between DeFi and blockchain gaming.  Camelot developers cannot tomorrow make their LPs suddenly crash in value because they can mint assets diluting them.  A valid trade is evaluated by the blockchain, not by Uniswap’s centralized authoritative server.  Interest in Aave is funded by fees, not by a blockchain grant.
Other blockchain foundations are FOMOing with absurd amounts of money into this narrative.  Okay.  Are they seeing a return?  UAW and DAU are terrible metrics for reasons evident to anyone who has ever made a bot.  Gaming has fundamental problems with trust, centralization, and insecurity that are not going to be solved no matter how many grants you throw at developers to make unfun games.
All of these listed games have already had their “seed rounds” selling NFTs to hopeful investors.  I’m not going to run down the list to see who has lost all of their money and who hasn’t, but one need merely look at Bridgeworld, Treasure’s own flagship game, to question whether throwing tens of millions of dollars more into the pit is really a good idea.",23
21270,divdaurres,2024-02-28 10:55:25,"When The Beacon launched its demo back on December 2022, we alone composed more than 25% of the total network activity (and our game is not transaction-heavy). Ronin more than doubled their market cap with the pixels launch.
Games have an impact, specially as a UA gateway for the chain. Most of our users had no idea what Arbitrum was when we launched, they joined the chain because of the game
Granted, let’s evaluate carefully who we give the funds to. Most games on the space are not good projects, that’s why we are picking Treasure and XAI to help filter them out, like publishers do.
Seeing ROI on these matters takes time. Games are hard to build and they take time and resources in contrast to building other Dapps.
Just one good game can bring thousands of users to the chain though, that’s the reason gaming is one of the main narratives currently. A good portion of those users remain in the blockchain and rotate to others domains like Defi, and once in the chain, they often become highly loyal to it. It’s also one of the best channels to onboard retail.
Blockchain and particularly web3 gaming are not going to disappear in 6 months, the industry is here to stay likely for years . Go to any mayor event and you’ll quickly realize why brands like Bandai, Square Enix and Zynga jumped in. Gaming is the most profitable entertainment industry in the world, and they see the opportunity
Not too many times a chain gets the option to become the a flagship gaming chain. Builders will go where there is support for them as well as momentum, and other chains are starting to offer that in a fantastic manner.
Arbitrum still has momentum and a fantastic tech stack, but we risk losing that momentum if we don’t maintain it, and once lost it will be very hard to sparkle things up again, specially in contrast to the competition.",24
21270,aepac,2024-02-28 18:58:03,"After reviewing our project lineup, it’s apparent that our strength lies predominantly in publishing, with Treasure being a notable exception for its ability to deliver genuinely engaging and enjoyable gaming experiences. This situation underscores the urgency for Arbitrum to accelerate its initiatives to stay competitive within the blockchain gaming space, a point clearly highlighted in the Game7 report.
To effectively draw in game developers and builders who are well-versed in creating compelling games—a rarity in the current landscape—we must swiftly implement a grant system based on performance milestones. This approach needs to be adopted promptly, within weeks rather than waiting for the next cycle.
Game development that is not purely functional (see GameFi) but also engaging and capable of retaining players is a significant challenge, evidenced by the mobile gaming industry’s dynamics. Where most simply fail despite having plenty of (free) tools available and short learning curve.
Experienced game publishers are key to transitioning Web2 players to Web3 seamlessly. However, the focus on minor details by some DAO members, as seen in draft comments, could detract from addressing these strategic imperatives urgently.
We must take decisive action now to prevent falling further behind. Without a shift in focus, Arbitrum risks being pigeonholed into core De-Fi projects, missing out on what could potentially catalyze significant growth in the crypto sector.
Let’s prioritize strategic actions that align with our long-term vision. Now.",25
21270,thedereksmart,2024-03-01 17:28:29,"I agree with all of this.
I have been a gamer and game dev for over 40 yrs, shipped over a dozen titles, worked with some of the best devs, publishers, distributors etc. Making games is hard. It’s super expensive (even standard indie games cost a lot more than most people even think e.g. PalWorld was $7M. Just think about that) and fraught with all kinds of insurmountable risks.
Though I have been in blockchain since the Bitcoin whitepaper was released, I only started looking at Web3 gaming seriously (while learning to play with all the programming toolsets) during the pandemic when I was bored and trying not to die a horrible death from a virus. I also authored a series of articles specifically about it. Then, to separate it from my Web2 studio, in 2022 I spun up a Web3 startup to publish an MMORPG game (which was already 100% completed but going through extensive visual upgrades) . Then, last month, I spun up another [smaller] team to create a new third-person combined arms shooter based on one of my other IP - also for Web3.
Amid all that, in talking to trusted people in the space, chains, devs, investors etc. do you know what I have noticed? Most of them don’t actually know the intricacies of funding and making games. Most of them just pretend that they do because their bags are at risk and throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks seems to be the plan. That plan continues to fail.
When you design and plan out a game, budget it, put a team together, depending on the game, that’s usually a 2-5 yr commitment. And in some extreme cases - mostly for AA or AAA games - even 10 years. e.g. recently released Hellriders2 took 10 (!) yrs to make. The next GTA title is approaching just as long. And PalWorld - a phenom success - took over 3 yrs. Despite the fact that we have a LOT more tools today than back when I started and when we had to build everything ourselves, it takes longer because most of those tools are more complex and thus take a lot more time - especially for n00bs - to get going. And content creation is an absolute time sink. It’s why you see most games now going with a low poly flat style art theme ala Fortnite et al.
All that said, the primary issue that I have found with anything related to Web gaming is that because it’s mostly about making money via owning stuff than about making and/or playing an enjoyable game, people think short-term. Unless you are staking tokens or NFTs for yield farming, why would you want to invest even $1M to make a game that’s going to take upwards of 2yrs? In Web3, that’s literally a lifetime. And it’s specifically why investors started doing token warrants as part of their deal flow so that they can get some - if not all - of their investment out sooner rather than later. Guess what that does to the token when they unlock.
Since 2020 when investors and chains started throwing funds at every cook who said they could make a game, the failures have been mounting in 2023 as a result because making games is hard; and most of those guys already cashed out and moved on to the next thing.
If you throw $500K at 5 teams to make a game for $100K apiece, you will reap what you sow. And the teams that have no funding, no vertical slice etc. are simply going to take that $100K because they can even though they know it’s completely inadequate to finish their game.
Most of the people doing BD for Web3 gaming don’t actually understand how the process actually works. And those who do, are finding that even the core Web2 principles don’t work in Web3 for some of the reasons I mentioned above.
Take for example the proposal in the OP:


Phase 1 - Game Development
This phase is critical where all foundations of the game are set in place and initial benchmarks for performance are established. If the game design and tooling are not setup properly during this phase the game will struggle to reach break-even.
A grant of $100,000 to $1.5M is recommended depending on the scope and state of the project.
Phase 2 + 3 - Alpha/Closed Beta and Open Beta
Phases two and three are intertwined with their shared focuses on refinement and optimization. It’s during these phases that positive unit economics must be achieved before launching and scaling the game.
A grant of $250,000 to $500,000 is recommended which is lower than phase one because this phase is focused on refinement.
Phase 4 + 5 - Game Launch and Growth
These phases are both intertwined as they’re focused on launch and sustainable growth. It’s critical that as the game scales it’s continuously optimized to reduce the cost to acquire users while increasing their lifetime value.
A grant of +$1.5M is recommended which is the highest given the majority is allocated to launch and user acquisition.


How many serious and experienced builders do you think those amounts are going to attract?
And while I do get the gist there, I have to point out that’s not how game funding - with risk mitigation - actually works. Plus, if you’re going to give a grant, then do that - but with the expectation that it’s money lost the moment it’s paid out. Expect nothing in return.
Here are some examples of Web3 gaming related proposals from our DAO:
(1) This was a $10M ask by Mighty Bear Games to create a publishing arm for the DAO. It’s one of the most comprehensive AIPs that you’re likely to see.
(2) This was a $20M ask by Jonah Blake to create a publishing arm for the DAO. Yet another comprehensive proposal.
(3) This was a $500K (originally a much larger $2M scope) marketing co-op ask for one of my teams - for a 100% completed Web2 game being re-released as Web3; a first of its kind.
(4) This was a $2M ask for a 100% completed game.
(5) This was a $500K ask for a game accelerator. It passed because all their buddies voted for it; but thus far, not a single game has come through there.
This is our DAO’s track record for passing game related AIPs. It’s as bad as it looks.
My point is this. The people voting in DAOs for most things have no insight into how they actually work.  And so, the size of the fund doesn’t actually matter either way. The second part of that is, milestone based funding only works if the producers (at both ends, that being the dev and publisher/investor) actually know what they’re doing, how the milestones are tailored, the criteria for milestone approval and payment etc. It’s not as simple as it looks or sounds. It’s a major op. All that, setting aside the caveats of doling out money via a voting system such as a DAO.
@dk3 made some exceptional points in his missive above regarding the criteria in this proposal and which all but guarantee that it won’t yield the expected results.
Djinn wrote an excellent proposal but which appears to minimize the involvement of outsiders. If the point is to have devs and publishers come to Arbitrum, then what’s the point of having a criteria that says they should already be on the chain? That makes no sense to me - unless I am missing something. He also said:
“The Ape community is now on Arbitrum, outside publishers looking to build on Arbitrum can also put forth proposals. I see a lot of interest coming from the publisher side which will = more builders.”
To me, that’s wishful thinking. For one thing, why would any builder want to go on apechain instead of ARB? The primary thing that apechain creates is competition for ARB. I have no idea where a lot of publisher interest would be coming from just because apechain is on ARB. Plus, the state of our DAO all but guarantees that apechain is DOA because without AIPs passing there’s seemingly no incentive to go on apechain. Plus, you can just deploy on ARB anyway - while also putting up a grant and running through the same gauntlet.
froggie made some other poignant posts as well. Specifically regarding how the funding would be doled out. As I mentioned above, the milestone proposals are entirely inadequate.
People like jlee who know how the grants gauntlet works can draw from a wealth of experience because, like some of us, those people do have the experience required to opine on such things.
I want to callout divdaurres eloquent post which also makes a salient point: chains tend to have a BD team that seek out experienced and credible builders. It rarely works the other way around. I would know because I’ve spoken to quite a few chains who do this - even as recently as last week.
In conclusion, whether the fund is $100M or $500M won’t make a difference if it’s :


going to all the same players already in the ARB ecosystem while already sitting on underperforming games.


if builders - at least the experienced ones - have to go through a daunting gauntlet that is the DAO voting system which has its own challenges, while trying to convince and on-board voters who have little to no understanding of how game dev actually works etc.


When I put up a $2M grant request at my DAO, it was an all-encompassing proposal from the perspective of both a dev and a publisher - and over 87% of the funds were to go right back into the community. Through discussions (as you can see in the link above), and having to explain it numerous times amid much resistance and derision, instead of withdrawing it entirely, I whittled it down to $500K just for the adoption of the token (at the time, we had no intentions of launching our own token)  which would have ultimately led to the game being on apechain down the road.
And it’s not that my DAO, like this one, doesn’t care about games. It’s that, tribalism and favoritism aside, the power brokers don’t; while others only care about preserving the treasury because giving out grants (unless it’s to their friends and contacts) leads to builders cashing out thus further depressing the value of the token. It’s a double-edged sword. And even with the advent of apechain, my DAO basically built a chain for Yuga seeing as even those who would be inclined to use it, aren’t likely to do so without going through the usual gauntlet. And why would they?
The experiences that most of us legacy game devs have had in Web3 is precisely why Web3 gaming continues to attract inexperienced people because apparently the plan is to throw everything at the wall and to see what sticks. Well, what if nothing sticks. Then what? Building a $25M game means that you don’t actually need grant funding because for that kind of money, even if a chain or investor tosses you money, it’s probably going to marketing or UA. And with everything that goes into developing Web3 backends - of which security alone will keep up the most experienced team late nights - when you tell people that even a $1M game probably spends about $250K on Web3 integration alone, they look at you funny. It’s with that type of mindset that we see grants - which aren’t likely to fund games from scratch anyway - not being an attractive proposal for all but the most experienced builders. There’s no getting around that. And chains which already have their own BD or investment team, operate with the same mindset in that some tend to lack the experience and insight required to pick winners or losers. And so, you find that they tend to fund failures while passing on the ones that actually do stand a chance - and vice versa.
Getting DAOs to fund gaming isn’t going to work out as planned; and so, will always yield failure and/r malcontent. Even if, as in the case of this proposal idea, it’s to funnel the money to publishers like Treasure who are already sitting on a list of underperforming (note: a fun game doesn’t mean that it’s making money) games because there no guarantees in an industry that yields a 90% failure rate.
Finally, most Web3 communities tend to be “elitists” in nature; and that just works to keep most outsiders away. The result is a walled garden. What’s the point of having a kitchen full of foodies if you have no cooks?
If this community is serious about gaming on ARB, it needs to re-think the approach while noting that without skin in the game you might as well give the money away without any safeguards.
ps. This is my first time here; and I only opined because a very good friend of mine, deep in the ARB ecosystem, encouraged me to “check it out”, the community was great, and for me to consider bringing  (like my friends over at Neon/Shrapnel, I am likely to deploy both on AVAX) my games to ARB etc.",26

Whether it’s a DAO, a publisher, a distributor, a chain, an investor group etc. it’s the same situation. That being, which bets to make on games and which pool to pick from. Even the best game by the best and most experienced teams tend to fail. In fact, the more experienced and talented the team, the more ambitious the game - and thus the more spectacular (because people expect more from such a team) the failure.
Doing this initiative via a DAO initiative such as this has a substantially high chance of [spectacular] failure.
In fact, since DAOs were a thing, it’s never worked - thus far. And that’s primarily due to growing pains, and also because making games - let alone finishing one - is a very difficult process. For example, TreasureDAO, for all their talent, experience and expertise, they too have found out how difficult it is to curate games - of any kind - and also what it takes to keep gamers playing them. Further, they and the others (Xai, Reboot, Hytopia, Sanko et al) aren’t publishers per se. And so, they simply can’t operate as one because that would imply a structure & process akin to a publisher or distributor in which the decisions and selections is a long arduous process that has no guarantees.
For example, Steam, EGS, GoG are all “publishing store fronts”. You fund your game. You sell it. In fact, only EGS - aside from their highly selective grants program - started the whole thing of pretending to be a publisher when they were doling out copious amount of cash for exclusives (which, btw, didn’t amount to much in terms of adoption of EGS as you can see from here and here) in order to get a leg up on Steam. That didn’t even make a dent. And they have the money to spend and the experienced people to actually pull it off.
Web3 doesn’t [yet] have the equivalent of a publisher or distributor. Not really. All these platforms are just store fronts - just like Steam et al. And when investors and chains gave money to a bunch of people who had zero experience in actually making games - let alone seeing them to market - it created the problem that we’re now seeing. To the extent that very few of us from Web2 are remotely interested in bringing games to Web3 because, optics (trad gamers dislike Web3 games) aside, it’s created just another layer in a process that was already rife with all kinds of insurmountable challenges. I mean, around 14K games release on Steam each year - most of them fail to even make $5K. These are facts and the data is there for all to see - if you know where to look. Start by going to Game Discover Co as they have the best metrics. It’s depressing.
So, while I believe that @Djinn has done a great job of laying it all out, it doesn’t highlight the pitfalls as well as the risk mitigation which would be inherent in something like this proposal. Basically, this proposal is seeking to setup a publishing arm via a grant; while putting those funds in the hands of the same [outfits] currently sitting on distressed game assets. It’s interesting - at least to me - that Dan references Lucas’ article on sustainable gaming ecosystem. Anyone who reads that - even without any knowledge of the gaming industry - will immediately see just how stacked up against the success the odds really are.  And then it goes further by indicating that interested parties need to already be in the ARB ecosystem in order to apply. Though I believe that it’s subject to change, that it was even a condition to exclude game devs outside of the ARB ecosystem all but guarantees that it’s likely to be ineffective in attracting core game devs.
To be clear: Making a game for Web3 isn’t the same as making a trad game. A game is likely to succeed or failure regardless of the target. In the end, it all boils down to the game and the team’s ability to pull it off.
When any game dev goes to a publisher or investor looking for funds - for anything related to games - they’re going to want metrics, a dev plan, a dev schedule, team bio - and now more than ever, a working vertical slice. There are no exceptions here. Setting up a $100M grant to give out money is all well and good, but it’s patently ineffective in every regard if the end result is to curate and fund games that stand a chance.
As I said in the TG channel, Nina Rong and the other authors highlighted games as the primary reason for their pitch to build apechain on ARB. You can read the AIP here. And I quote:



Attractive for a wide range of use cases, with a primary focus on gaming


If ApeChain wishes to house the next generation of consumer-facing applications and games, it must provide a stellar user experience - that begins with low fees and fast transactions.
Yuga Labs is publicly leaning into gaming as a primary vertical for its strategy, including bringing on new partners (1 ) and setting up dedicated communication channels for its gaming efforts (2 ). With ApeChain, the DAO should seek to create a natural home for its ecosystem.





BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:
Horizen Labs will leverage its deep industry experience to advise and guide the ApeCoin DAO and community on the initial development of ApeChain’s ecosystem. These efforts will result in a coherent strategy for ApeChain’s growth, primarily focused on gaming. This proposal marks the initial steps toward realizing that vision.





Working closely with partners to bring best-in-class web3 gaming experiences to the ecosystem.



In that RFP, the ARB foundation - without an AIP (or whatever you guys call it around here), put up $1M per year to build & support growth on apechain - for three years. So, $3M. It’s peanuts, really. And our DAO could have built apechain along the same lines if they were actually serious about it. In fact, Polygon, put up not only the costs of building apechain but also a $3M fund for growth (games etc).
The point that I am making is that people keep throwing out these immaterial sums of money for games as if that’s how experienced people do it. It’s not. You’re not going to put up a $3M fund for games without someone coming to the conclusion that you’re just going to end up curating sub-par games - or give the money to inexperienced pals who are just going to do what they’ve been doing since 2020. That being, flooding Web3 with sub-par games. Then we come full circle.
And that some people believe that a decent mobile game only costs $250K to make is hilarious to me. That’s not even the average. Let me give you an example of the type of numbers that indie and even AA game devs think about when they decide to go make a game. Some years ago, I bought a game that cost the investors $25M+ to make. I wasn’t part of the start, but came in toward the end when we were hired to complete it etc. So, I knew the numbers already. I ended up buying that game for a very low sum, and as of this writing, in total, has already cost me over $8M. And that’s not counting the $3M+ that it’s going to cost me to re-release it as a Web 2.5 (it’s not all on chain) game as I we’re currently working on doing.  Back in Jan, we started to work on a second Web3 game from scratch. You know what an 12-14 month dev time for a team of 6 cost? About $2M. And even so, that’s because 1) we’re using UE5, and 2) it’s based on one of my existing IP for which we previously released a game through Microsoft; and so we already had all the production art assets (though subject to some improvements) needed for this second derivative game. With this, amortized for a start from scratch game, that’s about $4M+ (at best) over a two yr span. I’m not even joking here.
There isn’t a single chain or grantor on this planet that any of us would go to and ask for even $2M to make a game, let alone $10M. Thing is, grants aren’t supposed to fund a game from start to finish. But therein lies the rub. There’s a dearth of decent Web3 games because most the guys making these games aren’t thinking long-term because anything determined to be “long” is likely to be regarded as “longer” when it comes to Web3. And most game devs - regardless of experience - already tend to have a terrible track record when it comes to dev time schedules. Just add a trailing zero to everything. There, fixed it. It’s a process. So, what’s going to happen when all the decent (depending on how you look at it) Web3 games take 2-5 years and a few million Dollars to make? Even if they don’t need any supplemental funding such as from grants and the like?
Asking the foundation for $100M+ to do this, isn’t a path to success, and I can all but guarantee that the result won’t be as expected. Especially as written. Do you want to see what something like this should like if it’s to have some chance of success? Please read the two AIPs by Jonah and the Mighty Bears guys that I previously posted. My AIP (also linked above) isn’t that, because it was co-marketing and not a publishing collab like those, as I wasn’t looking for money to fund the game dev. I just figured that I could push my DAO to embrace games - just like what you guys are doing here. And thus far, every single game related initiative has failed to pass there. Heck, we have yet to see anything from the $500K games accelerator that we funded. And that’s mostly, again, because it takes time.
Creating a $100M pool to curate games is a lot more risky and fraught with insurmountable challenges than just encouraging devs to run the voting gamut whereby they get to layout the game plan, the schedule, the team, the ask etc. And if it’s $30K or $3M, so be it. Taking the decisions out of the hands of the voting members only puts it in the hands of a select few who wouldn’t have the same oversight as the eclectic - though in some regard, inexperienced - DAO voters. Plus, most people have zero confidence in DAO votes anyway - regardless of the merits. So there’s that.
When I look at the ARB grants, I can’t help but wonder why there isn’t, for example, a 100M Gaming Incentive Program, managed directly by the foundation in concert with external teams who have the experience to guide them through funding decisions. I mean, the STIP was a whopping 50M! Similarly, earlier this year, there was an $85M grant program which was handled in concert with a council and advisors - who, I would assume, have the experience to manage that specific program. So, my suggestion would be for something like that to be setup, and with its own council and advisors who have the requisite development, publishing and investment experience - and who aren’t likely to just go give the funds to their pals while ignoring worthy devs - especially from Web2 devs who tend not to have much headway into the tightly-knit Web3 ecosystem, as well as reliable contacts within it.
Disclaimer: We are deploying both of my Web3 games on another chain - not ARB; and so, none of this matters to me either way other than I love opining on things that are within my experience and purview when asked and/or needed. While my [direct] takes tend not to be popular because most of our Web3 degens prefer the rosy WAGMI picture, the least that I can do is just lay it all out because it’s unlikely that most would take that particular risk.",30
21270,Djinn,2024-03-07 00:09:37,"Your sentiments make sense.
We had a several productive discussions at Eth Denver between the Foundation, DAO members, and gaming experts (exPolygon folks, big VCs, former publishers, Fortune 5 gaming peeps) about the Gaming Catalyst, and the unilateral feedback that we received was:

Arbitrum as an ecosystem absolutely wants to support gaming, but it needs to be a sustainable model that encourages great builders with upside for the DAO
The effort does require experts and best-of-class industry folks to make this a success

Both items are being addressed with edits to the draft - which will be published to the forum in a separate post. (The open draft is now about 3 weeks outdated with the most recent suggestions put forth by a variety of industry voices).
Keep the feedback coming guys!",32
21270,thedereksmart,2024-03-08 00:39:42,"Sounds like you got some really great feedback at eth Denver; and those two points are precisely the gist of both of my [lengthy] missives above - as you’ve no doubt noticed.
Let me expand on those two points:



 Djinn:


Arbitrum as an ecosystem absolutely wants to support gaming, but it needs to be a sustainable model that encourages great builders with upside for the DAO
The effort does require experts and best-of-class industry folks to make this a success



Chains don’t need to become something they’re not. They’re just tech stacks. e.g. datacenters host and feature services, they don’t try to be/do anything else. Similarly, service and middleware providers focus exclusively on their strengths. To that end, no chain should strive to do something that they’re not equipped for.
That said, it’s why there’s a separation of things like engineering and foundation in chains. If the job of the foundation is to govern and bring growth to the chain, then how do you define “growth”? Well, as a chain, you define that via adoption. Which means dApps and utility which bring people (needed for growth) to the chain. And do this, you need copious amounts of money and talent. The latter two are why we have a series of zombie chains littering the [blockchain] landscape because you can have the best tech but nobody will use it if 1) they don’t know about it 2) they don’t have an incentive or use case for it.
How is ARB going to support gaming so that it’s sustainable and with upside for the DAO?
Short of giving money out and wishing on a prayer, none of those things are achievable due to all the aforementioned dependencies and insurmountable challenges that come with gaming. Neither the foundation nor the DAO proper can be expected to reasonably perform any of the functions required of a publishing arm. So, what’s left? Treat it as marketing BD and with incentives. Which is basically a “hands off” grants program with minimal entry requirements front-loaded with the usual checks and balances. In other words, no different from how the pre-existing ARB grants already work.
Here’s how I would do it. This is only for mind-mapping and can be revised as-needed.
SETUP



Foundation sets up a grant program similar to STIPP e.g. Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP)


Fund the aforementioned grant program with a $200M test-run
$200M (converted to whatever $ARB is trading at) test-run fund is more than sufficient for indie and AA games. Depending on the success or failure of the inaugural run, this can be automatically replenished every 12-18 months or so as-needed.


Issue the grant (in full) to a separate corp entity (off-shore or not, doesn’t matter) with multi-sigs etc. Lets call it GCP Group
This entity would be completely separate from the foundation and run by people also separate from the foundation. DAOs don’t work for stuff like this. So, don’t even bother with that noise.
For this, put out a 1099 (work-for-hire) notice, then ask for submissions within a set period (e.g. 14 days).
You’re basically looking for people with game industry experience in a development/management role. These are the types of people who not only understand games, but who can also understand precisely what a game dev is saying to them. Given all the recent layoffs in the industry, there are dozens - if not hundreds - of qualified people that fit this role; though most have no intentions of coming to Web3.
After the application term expires, filter through all the applicants and pick 5 people (advisors) from the pool. From that pool, designate 1 person (the most experienced, accomplished etc) as core lead for the group.
Hire with a salary cap of $10K - $25K (paid monthly in $ARB directly to their wallet) based on experience, expertise etc. and for a 12-month (this is a 1099 gig, renewable as-needed) term. This is likely a part-time gig in which you’re basically a glorified producer type babysitter.
You absolutely want game devs who have actually worked on and shipped commercial games. No exceptions. And none of that “I worked on WoW; though I was just the water boy”. If your name isn’t on the list of credits for having been in a development (actual design, coding etc) role of a shipped game, you’re not getting in. No exceptions.
Their monthly fees are paid from the grant - not the foundation. They also setup their own expenses to include legal, admin etc. I would suggest that this group’s budget be set at $2M a year, which would cover any/all operating expenses.
NOTE: Any applicant already part of the ARB foundation, its partners, publishers etc. are automatically disqualified. No exceptions. The reason for this should be obvious; so I won’t spell it out and risk it being taken out of context.


I won’t go into any of the standard setup for ops which include things like multi-sig, best practices, hiring third-parties as-needed etc. But the group needs a specific multi-sig wallet which is used solely for revenue generation.


BUILD

Now you have 5 people sitting on a $200M grant. Lets go spend it!
Setup criteria for games which will be reviewed and funded. I like this part of your missive above. So, I will adopt it in some regard.
To be clear, you absolutely want to attract the best of the best, the cream of the crop games which have an inkling of success within. As we note, 90% of them will fail - but we don’t care about that; and you’ll see why that is.
Each project must submit the following (the group above should provide a template)

Game overview (no need for a design doc as that’s too in-depth and patently boring). Go read Ella’s pitch deck notes to help with your submission via the aforementioned template
Game tokenomics doc
Team Info (if it’s an established team, corp etc. then all you need is the lead and nobody else)
Dev schedule (not to exceed +18 months from date of grant submission) /w clear KPI milestones (tranche payments will be based on these)
Use of funds (clear outline). This has to be separate and must be commensurate with the scope of the game and team e.g. nobody is going to give you a $1M grant just so you can go make a $250K game and spend the rest on meme coins or a Lambo.
GTM plan

SUBMISSION CRITERIA  AND GRANTS
Phase 1 - Early Stage
You have a game idea that you’ve been toying with, then [foolishly] decided that you were going to make a commercial go of it because you believe your game to be in the 10% that’s totally going to make it. Right! Come on down!
– You have everything required in the grant template, somewhat playable prototype etc.
– Release within 18 months
– Grant  Amount: $500K to $2M
– 70/30 rev split w/ GCP group for 12 months
– 2% of [unlocked at TGE] token allocation (if any) goes to GCP group to be airdropped to DAO
Phase 2 - Alpha | Beta
You’re experienced, already ran through the game dev gauntlet, have a game in progress, and need funding for the absolutely insane last mile that never seems to draw near. You have a previously shipped game either solo, in a team, at a corp, whatever. Doesn’t matter if it succeeded or failed - not your problem. You worked on a game. It shipped. Your name is in the credits.
– You have everything required in the grant template, playable alpha | beta etc.
– Release within 18 months
– Grant  Amount: $2M to $4M
– 70/30 rev split w/ GCP group for 24 months
– 2% of [unlocked at TGE] token allocation (if any) goes to GCP group to be airdropped to DAO
Phase 3 - Release Candidate / Final Work Product
You’re way past those n00bs up in phase 1&2. You have a game - an actual freaking game - that’s over 90% completed, bugs galore even, but you’re definitely going to make it - this time; big boy pants and everything.
– You have everything required in the grant template, playable game in final Beta or RC state etc.
– Release within 6-8 months
– Grant  Amount: $4M to $6M
– 70/30 rev split w/ GCP group for 36 months
– 2% of [unlocked at TGE] token allocation (if any) goes to GCP group to be airdropped to DAO
Phase 4 - Migration
You have a 100% completed game, Web2 or Web3, doesn’t matter. You have front-loaded all the costs of dev, but now you want to come to ARB but need a little help with the expense and expertise of migrating over. The GCP Group would love to see you migrate your game over to the ecosystem and to help you do that. By working with TreasureDAO, Helika etc. you have a dedicated team of experts to help with the transition.
– You have everything required in the grant template, playable game in release state etc.
– Deployment on ARB within 4-6 months
– Grant  Amount: Up to $6M
– No rev split with GCP Group
– 2% of [unlocked at TGE] token allocation (if any) goes to GCP group to be airdropped to DAO
RUN

GCP Group isn’t a publisher and shouldn’t even pretend to be one. It’s basically a glorified BD team of experienced gaming people.
So, now we have GCP Group of 5 people running through submissions, and figuring out how to spend $200M - fer real (not like those other guys who claim to have these massive funds when in fact it’s just a ploy to get you to go talk to them - and nobody on the planet that you know of, ever got money from them. Yeah, those guys) to the benefit of the ARB ecosystem.
The key here is that, with those amounts and a great GCP Group team, you’re looking at funding a large number of diverse (from all genres) quality games from experienced devs who can actually build and deploy product. Heck, if you come across 25 games of great quality and team, and you give each $5M, well, do the math.
As GCP is going to be getting 30% revenue from deployed (at any stage) games, it can either stake that revenue and make some gains or just recycle it into its annual expenses.
Each game’s approved funding is paid out in achievable milestone based tranches which, from grant approval to release candidate and final deployment release, should span the presented dev schedule and paid out in 4-6 tranches, with the final being the largest - except for an established team which implies less risk. No milestone delivery, no payment. After two missed milestones, it’s game over - and you’re out of the program.
In fact, for established teams with shipped games, track record etc. you can give them the full grant in equal monthly or quarterly tranches. So, for such a team, a $5M grant for a 12 month dev cycle would get paid in equal monthly tranches. These are the guys you absolutely WANT to come to GCP for funding.
This could absolutely work. The community obviously trusts (I expect that they do) the Arb Foundation due to their current track record. I mean, look no further than the treasury, the tech etc. And so, there should be no concern about an initiative like this being taken out of the hands of the emotions and angst that tend to come with DAO voting etc.
Lastly - and this important. Having 5 people in GCP means that they all get to pick from a pool of, say, 4 games they like. So, lets assume, 20 games are now in the running. From that pool, each team member gets to vote (Y|N) for each one. The games with the highest (5) votes, get to go first. Then you do it all over again as time moves on. The key here is not to sit on $200M that you’re not spending. So, grants should be awarded literally every freaking week - nonstop - until all the money allocated for the games is gone. Then you sit, wait, and watch it all fall apart - while hoping and praying that at least 10% of the funded games make it - and succeed. But they don’t even have to succeed. They just have to make it to release and be parked on the ARB chain.
One thing that I would like to add involves the teams who have come on this journey and who, like yourself and others, in their own way have brought Arbitrum to where it is today. That would be these guys previously called out in your OP.



Treasure  (first Arbitrum title launched Oct 2021; 10+ live games)
Xai  (no live games on Arbitrum; several titles in active development or migration)
Reboot  (first Arbitrum title launched Jan 2023)
Hytopia  (no live games on Arbitrum; first title in active development or migration)
Sanko GameCorp  (4+ live games and streaming platform live on Arbitrum, multiples games in active development or migration for Orbit Chain gaming ecosystem)



They’re mostly sitting on catalogs of underperforming games or games which don’t stand a snowball in hell chance of survival. Don’t take my word for it, go ahead and ask for the engagement and revenue metrics.
So, where do they fit in? Simple. Have them run their games (new or old) through GCP using the above criteria. For one thing, what if there’s a good game that’s not getting traction due to lack of marketing funds, outreach etc? Simple, send them to TreasureDAO or Helika where, via GCP, they can get a grant used to pay TreasureDAO, Helika etc. to build a robust marketing and outreach plan.
In fact,  now that I think about it, making these groups a part of the GCP grant process provides a launchpad of experience for on-boarding Web2 devs coming to Web3 and who are literally lost in the narrative.
I would even go one step further and mandate that any team getting GCP grants must plan to allocate a minimum of 10% of their funding to be paid (by GCP) directly to the select groups like Treasure, Helika etc. who then create a plan (submitted to GCP) as required. This “advisory” role could handle things ranging from GTM to tokenomics and community outreach. In fact, I mention this because I have such a group working with me on my Web3 projects - and they do everything. All I do is write code, manage my teams, show my face on calls as-needed etc. I don’t deal with any of the noise.
If you’re wondering why I’m not suggesting that GCP hire them or advisors to do the above, it’s because that won’t work to the benefit of the GCP or those partners. So, it has to be done on a case by case basis. And in doing so, for example, Helika could be managing 5 funded projects and getting paid for 5, instead of being paid a fixed sum to manage 5 projects while not having the resources to do so. More funds means more resources.
Aside from rewarding the loyalty of these groups and their builders, making them a part of this GCP process not only helps with optics, good will etc, but it also helps with filtering games on a “first look” basis. e.g. If someone asked me today which Web3 publisher or group to approach about their game, the first words out of my mouth would be “Why do you need a third-party? You know you can just deploy yourself, right?” And if they say they want funding, I would then direct them to the angels and VC investors that I know and trust. I would never - ever - send them to a chain or a “Web3 pseudo publisher/shop” or a DAO of any kind. Ever. In fact, funny story. A guy (I won’t out him, but he’s welcome to do so himself) who worked on one of my games some years back, reached out to me on TG a few days ago after reading my first post here. Why? He knows me. He’s worked for me. I explained to him why going directly to the Arb Foundation, let alone the DAO, for a grant of the size they were seeking, was a lesson in futility. So, yes, those guys are out there - all looking for a way in. And something like GCP - done properly - will absolutely attract the right game devs.
And if the GCP grant agreement says they have to deploy and stay on ARB, then it creates an ecosystem that just builds and grows. If any grantee wants to leave, ofc they’re free to do so; but they’re still liable for that 30% to GCP, regardless.
It’s going to take time because making games is a long, hard and arduous process. But, for these kinds of money in my suggestions above, chances are there will be so many quality games in phase 2&3 that GCP wouldn’t even be able to go through all submissions in order to determine the best ones to take a risk on.
BUILD ERRORS

Right. Lets just ignore everything I just wrote, and instead, you, @karelvuong, @Soby and any one of the super stars at Helika, go ask the Arb Foundation for $200M; and use it to go build a proper Web3 Games Publishing Group - parked on ARB. I can’t be involved in any of that because I have my own teams and commitments to look after. But I would gladly serve in an advisory role as-needed because from what I have seen and heard thus far, you guys absolutely, positively, need an [experienced] game dev and outsider to help this along.



 Djinn:

Both items are being addressed with edits to the draft - which will be published to the forum in a separate post. (The open draft is now about 3 weeks outdated with the most recent suggestions put forth by a variety of industry voices).


I don’t think separating this any further is a good idea because that means all the work in this thread gets forgotten (I mean, look at the non-existent metrics in this thread itself), only to perhaps be regurgitated anew elsewhere.
Discourse has an edit tracker (the small pencil on the top-right). So, I would recommend just completely wiping (don’t delete it; just select + delete the text) that first post contents, and posting your new thoughts in it. Then, anyone who wants to see how it started compared to where it is now, can use the pencil to view the diffs.

Thank you for your detailed comments, as a game lover, it was very interesting for me to read all this.

 cp0x:

Good question. I actually did consider this approach. However, I just assumed it would fall under phase 3. But having read your post, and in thinking about it some more, I was inspired to add phase 4 which I believe covers it in a clearer fashion.
As to your question about “creating games from scratch”, the key metrics here are adoption and growth. It’s better for the ecosystem if these games and the devs are somewhat incubated within ARB and to help grow here. There is a reason that console manufacturers spend so much money curating games by great teams. Once you end up on a console, you’re likely to continue developing for that platform due to the relationships with the dev team, consumers etc. Never underestimate the power of familiarity and loyalty.
One thing to bear in mind is that it isn’t easy to migrate from Web2 to Web3. Trust me, I’ve been working on that since 2021. And it’s not even about engineering, but about navigating all the nuances of Web3, the key people, the communities - the noise etc. So, going to established games and offering them money to migrate isn’t as simple as it sounds. Especially since they’re already established. What good is offering them money when they can make that same amount of money - or even more - without ever getting involved in Web3?
Also, what a lot of people don’t seem to realize is that there really is no “Web2 v Web3” when it comes to games. It’s just an approach to distribution and a tech stack. So, for games, there’s an inherent overlap of gamers. So, you’re not going to make games specifically for “Web3 gamers” and expect to yield the same financial and community benefits as a comparable Web2 game. It’s near impossible. And that’s why most of us who have games that have sold millions of units, made lots of money etc. just lol when we see Web3 games celebrating inconsequential metrics like TVL, DAW et al and which don’t say anything about “how much money they are making - net rev”. A Web3 game celebrating 100K users but haven’t even made $0.10c on the Dollar, is a flop by any Web2 metric - depending on the game. A good indie game by a 4-person team that cost $500K to make, depending on the game, probably makes its money back with about +10% ROI. That’s not a lot. And it’s why you will hardly see more than 1 or 2 games from over 95% of the indie devs and studios. Most operate at a loss, and subsequently disappear to go work for someone else after experiencing the dream - even for a brief moment.
So, in my experience, attracting and curating key devs and their games at these formative stages is the best approach. For example, phase 4 is basically giving money to an experienced team to come over. Normally, that’s a marketing spend and is part of the cost of doing business. You have to pay to play - and Web3 doesn’t change those rules of engagement. Saying “We have better tech, low fees etc” isn’t enough these days. Know why? Because all the key players already have all that - and more. So, what are you - a chain - going to compete on and for? For example, I would bet dimes to donuts that if my friends over at Neon (Shrapnel) approached a chain and asked for $6M to migrate their game over - even as multi-chain - the chain would jump through hoops to throw $6M their way. Consequently, my other friends over at Kap Games recently migrated their Captain & Co game over to Blast. There’s a reason for stuff like that - and it will keep on happening unless the ARB foundation and you guys in the DAO start getting serious about games and doing whatever it takes to attract - and keep - good games and their teams within the ecosystem. Everyone else (see IMX, AVAX, MATIC et al) is doing just that - and not just because they have people with gaming experience within their teams, but also because they realize that - since the advent of the micro-processor age - games have always led the way to the adoption of anything that remotely whiffs of entertainment prospects.
I am just one guy, but I have a voice and a wealth of experience. And so, I share these thoughts from the perspective of a gamer (first) and game dev (second) who has been around since the very early beginnings which even predated online games.",35

 thedereksmart:

You absolutely want game devs who have actually worked on and shipped commercial games. No exceptions.


I understand the rationale behind preferring game developers who have successfully shipped commercial games—it suggests a certain level of expertise and accomplishment. However, I find myself increasingly skeptical that this criterion alone is a reliable predictor of future success.
My recent experience has led me to reconsider the value of profiles emerging from major mobile gaming publishers like Scopely and King. In fact, I used to consider gaming background a must and this year the (new) best performing profiles on my team, do not have it…
While undoubtedly skilled, many such individuals tend to lack the adaptable, entrepreneurial spirit crucial for thriving in start-up environments. Moreover, their salary expectations often reflect their backgrounds in established companies, and a genuine interest in Web3 innovation is frequently absent.
This isn’t to say that we shouldn’t strive to attract top talent from the gaming industry to Arbitrum. Indeed, establishing a Gaming Catalyst Program to entice game developers is a strategy I wholeheartedly support. As I mentioned in my previous comment, we are behind schedule…
However, becoming overly fixated on specific qualifications or experiences at the outset could hinder our agility and responsiveness, especially when competing platforms (see Polygon for instance) are rapidly securing talent.
In summary, while industry experience is valuable, our focus should also include a candidate’s adaptability, enthusiasm for Web3, and alignment with start-up culture. This approach will ensure we build a team not just of proven professionals, but of innovators ready to navigate the unique challenges and opportunities of the Web3 gaming space.



 thedereksmart:

And that some people believe that a decent mobile game only costs $250K to make is hilarious to me. That’s not even the average.


Regarding development costs, the reality in the mobile gaming world is highly variable.
For instance, the hypercasual genre, with offerings from developers like Voodoo, Homa Games, or Lion Studios, illustrates this point well. Such games can be developed in about a month by a team in Turkey for less than $30k, often recouping their investment within days. On the opposite end are AAA titles that have consumed over three years of development and budgets exceeding $10 million, only to fail upon release. This discrepancy raises questions about the efficacy of the development and publishing teams behind these costly ventures.
Ultimately, what significantly influences a project’s success is the leadership—specifically, the Game Manager (GM) in the industry. Their vision and how it’s executed through project milestones can make all the difference, regardless of the budget size.



 thedereksmart:

If someone asked me today which Web3 publisher or group to approach about their game, the first words out of my mouth would be “Why do you need a third-party? You know you can just deploy yourself, right?


Deploying a game on your own is indeed an option, but the likelihood of successfully attracting a Web3-knowledgeable player base on your own is slim. This reality underscores the unique value offered by publishers like Treasure, who have cultivated a community of Web3 enthusiasts always on the lookout for their next gaming adventure. Their ability to engage players through effective cross-promotion is invaluable.
In my view, the real challenge for platforms like Arbitrum lies in bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 gaming in such a seamless way that players transition without even realizing it. This approach not only capitalizes on the universal appeal of gaming but also positions it as a pivotal catalyst for broader crypto adoption. Success in this arena starts with the fundamental ingredient of any game’s appeal: fun.
Before we can entice Web2 players into the Web3 space, we need to ensure we have compelling, enjoyable games for them to play.

I understand what you mean, but I probably need to expand on my reasoning for this.
That being, the people in the GCP Group absolutely need to be able to understand game development in order to properly assess the viability of a [game] project, the milestones, what they mean, the costs etc. If not, then they would have no choice but to hire external advisors for that. I don’t find that to be efficient nor a good use of funds and resources.
Even in gaming where we tend to sometimes have execs with no previous gaming background (e.g. EA, Activision et al), they take the role of CEO who already have their gaming and game dev team within the corp. The GCP Group won’t have that - unless they either hire additional people or external advisors. That was the primary impetus for my outlining that criteria.
That this initiative is focused on gaming, it is important that the GCP Group focus specifically on hiring those types of people who have that sort of [gaming] experience. But note that there’s nothing that says the GCP Group couldn’t have one of the types that you mentioned be part of the 5-person team. Besides, depending on who ends up front-running this, if not @Djinn, I am sure that they would have already considered your [valid] suggestions in this regard as well.

True. And I previously mentioned this point as well. But it’s a lot more nuanced that that. A small indie team, running lean and mean on $30K, is likely to have a great idea - executed well enough - and which a competing AA team with $300K has no insight into. This is specifically why we see - time and time again - the leaps and bounds success of indie teams.
That said, my idea for this initiative isn’t just about costs, but also about experience and expertise. It’s why I laid out the suggested criteria for which games make the cut and thus get funding.
Also, the failures of AA or AAA games isn’t usually just down to the efficacy (?) of the development and publishing teams. There’s a lot that happens for a game to fail - regardless of cost. One of those primary reasons is the crazy games market itself whereby even the best reviewed, best designed game is likely to fail for patently unknown reasons. Happens far more regularly that the casual onlooker knows.

I mostly agree with this. My only dissenting opinion would be that we need to stop thinking about and catering to “Web3 enthusiasts” because it’s a bubble - that’s not growing; at least not quickly enough. It just isn’t. Every single metric that I’ve seen thus far shows that the growth is neither organic nor sustainable because it’s usually the same gamers in the same exact churn. It’s precisely why Treasure, for all their expertise and experience, like Steam, EGS et al are currently sitting on a catalog of underperforming third-party games. And more to my previous point; it’s not that the games on Treasure are bad, it’s mostly that nobody outside the churn cares about them. Especially when there are far better games outside of the Web3 sphere.
Also, when you look at Steam, EGS, GoG, GmG etc. you see a massive number of games - most of them self-published - but which don’t actually have traction, let alone make money on those platforms. Let me share an example of what happened to an indie dev over the weekend whereby she released her game - having worked on it for almost 10 years - only for it to be front-run on the Steam charts when EA dumped a slew of legacy game re-releases. That indie game is basically DOA regardless of whether or not it is a good or bad game.
IMO, stigma aside, the challenge in Web3 gaming has nothing to do with tech, but rather with the games themselves. Most trad gamers diving into Web3 have found games that are neither fun nor comparable to what they were already playing. I have long argued (even with Yat over at Animoca, who is a staunch advocate of Web3 gaming - bar none) that P2E let alone ownership of game assets is not the incentive that most people think it is. I actually wrote a blog about this specific issue back in Jan.
So, when you have a situation whereby “Web3 games” aren’t attracting trad gamers, you end up with this Web3 gaming bubble that comprises of only those gamers who buy into the whole concept of “making money” instead of “having fun”. It’s why, for the most part, even poor Web3 games tend to have an audience - some never actually “played” them as they’re mostly focused on farming assets and tokens they can sell. This has been - and imo always will be - the dividing factor. Do we make games for Web3 for the fun or for the money. And what happens when a “not fun” game stops yielding monetary gain? Gamers stop playing - then move on to the next churn. The P2E concept coupled with the whole concept of owning stuff you can sell is what has Web3 in this insurmountable rut which only a good game with good P2E mechanics can overcome.
Look at Yuga. Every single game they’ve thus far released has failed in terms of adoption outside their IP bubble. Last month, they pivoted (I wrote about that too) in their attempt to attract trad gamers outside of their bubble. Every aspect points to that being a failed initiative because - again - the DDU game is still gated in some way and caters mostly to the same bubble. And it wasn’t even that game that signaled a pivot. They’ve now flat-out said that they’re not even making a trad MMO “game” - which is what most were expecting. Instead, it’s now looking like a virtual world akin to Nifty Island (which has also failed spectacularly) rather than Fortnite or Roblox. I suspect that in the end it will just be a re-make of Active Worlds (if you remember this one, congrats, you got old) or its ilk. That’s not a bad thing because they’re building for the people who gave them $300M to make the Otherside dream. Except for the part where, due to time constraints and tech challenges, that dream has now changed - and most of their hodlers aren’t particularly happy about it at all.
The minute people understand and accept that “Web3 gaming” isn’t likely to achieve the lofty heights of trad gaming - which has had a decades head start - the more it will be obvious that catering to the Web3 bubble only works if you’ve found a way to recoup your costs YoY. It’s the same challenge that indie devs like me have whereby it’s juggle: Do we spend $50K making a game knowing you can recoup it easily from a built-in audience or go for broke with a $500K (assuming you even have that to spare) game and hope for the best?



 aepac:

In my view, the real challenge for platforms like Arbitrum lies in bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 gaming in such a seamless way that players transition without even realizing it.


The challenge isn’t actually in “bridging” the gap - as none actually exists now that on-boarding in Web3 games is a seamless experience that most games have adopted. The challenge is in making a fun game, and one in which the Web3 elements are unobtrusive in nature.
Also, bridging the gap isn’t a challenge for Arbitrum or any chain because they’re neither publishers/distributors nor game devs. It’s simply not their job. They’re just a tech stack - akin to a console publisher - looking to create initiatives for game devs to build on their chain. And in order to do that, they have to give devs a reason to actually want to build here because, as I mentioned previously, devs no longer primarily care about a chain’s tech stack, gas fees etc because all of those concerns have been mitigated in the past year - and will only get better as time moves on. That’s why tech is no longer a reasonable advantage.
Over the weekend, I wrote about IMX. Thus far, they have over 270 (!) games on the network; 75 of which were on-boarded just this past qtr alone. And I personally know quite a few devs who now build there. You know some of the reasons why they choose IMX over, say, AVAX? Funding, the support team - and primarily the fact that IMX was created by gamers who absolutely know and understand what game devs are looking for in order to be successful on their platform. I mean, right now, as I type this, I am aware of no less than 3 teams moving off ARB, one of which, as I mentioned previously, has already migrated to Blast.
Arbitrum has lagged so far behind in gaming, that the very concept of catching up is going to be an insurmountable challenge that no amount of funding is going to fix in the short-term. I am all but certain that the foundation knows this. And ofc Dan, Karel and all the authors of this initiative are well aware of this simple fact. And that’s why the core of my suggestions for the GCP is one that is bold enough in its intent that, at the very least, attracting experienced builders should be the core focus. Trying to cater to $30K games isn’t going to do anything other than churn out games that likely nobody cares about - let alone plays. Then, what’s the point?

Absolutely my point; and one which I think all of us engaged in this space can agree with.

lol. I find that a wall of text is better than no text at all, or text that are inconclusive, thus leading to even more text. In all my years, I have found that it’s better to have a wall of text in one place, than a set of texts which are likely to have people lose track rather than focus on the core. Then again, among other things that require writing a lot, I’m a game designer and dev, so I’m used to writing - a lot. Plus, I type fast. Really fast. 
Love this exchange btw, and your comments are on point. I hope that others will opine on this topic because, as I said previously, though I have nothing at stake here, Dan’s efforts to thrust the community into action should set the stage for action - not inaction.

21184,JoJo,2024-02-11 12:33:02,"The following is a destructured post that tries to highlight what protocols need and what the DAO could do for them, with a focus on grants. Would like to remark: this post is focused on the builders point of view, from people that don’t do governance, or that don’t do governance only, but that are trying everyday to build and innovate something in the Arbitrum ecosystem. So for sure is missing some more stuff.
First, a very brief, personal view of the L2 landscape. The landscape of L2s is getting competitive as time goes by. While fundamentals for Arbitrum are here, cause the tech stack is awesome, fundamentals matter only up to a certain point in competing products (and who says this is not true has never been building anything in life, sorry). So the key is all about making the Arbitrum stakeholders perceive and realise that Arbitrum is the best place to be.
Who are the stakeholders here? From a builder standpoint: builders and users, either on Arbitrum or outside Arbitrum.
How do you align everybody about Arbitrum being the goto place to be in? This is a strategic question that could be answered in several ways. My personal take: the simplest way, which also not the one most cost efficient, is that you do here AT LEAST what competitors do, plus some more. To be more specific

give users a good experience and an economic reasons to be on arbitrum —> means good products (owners: protocols), good UX (owners: protocols/OClabs), incentives (owner: DAO/protocols)
give builders a reason to build in Arbitrum, or keep building in Arbitrum, instead of doing it somewhere else —> means tech support (owner: OClabs), marketing support for reach (owner: Arbitrum Foundation), economic support to bootstrap, build and sustain products (owner: DAO).

We can try to focus on what the DAO can do of the above, which is

providing incentives for usage
providing support to build new products or migrate existing ones in Arbitrum
provide support to bootstrap new, smaller products.

Below I have tried to give a raw overview of what that should mean in term of grants’ programs.
Pasted Graphic1358×1066 113 KB
DEVELOPMENT GRANTS
This is the biggest gap of the DAO. So far we have subsidizied to third parties (the foundation, questbook and others) this role, but the DAO should create a pilot development program and iterate on it up to the point in which almost any async request from protocols can be satisfied. The program should be complementary to the one currently managed by the foundation, and have clear rules that avoid abuses (re: all protocols asking for a grant to build every new vault). The biggest hurdle are objective ways to evaluate milestones: if i get a grant to build a car, I could build a tractor or a ferrari. Needs specifications and use cases among others.
INCENTIVE GRANTS
Probably the field in which as a DAO we have more experience. With LTIPP going live, idea could/should be not only to enhance what we saw in STIP, but also gun for a constant program, organised in epoch/seasons, that can constantly provide incentives, with specific rules to avoid abuse. We might be on the right road for this.
BOOTSTRAP GRANTS
These grants are actually a mix of the previous, with a big difference in the size of the needed grant (usually needs a lot less) and also a few specific needs (support in marketing, support in guidance, support in networking). Some of the programs currently live partially fill this gap. If we find a way to have a robust incentive and development grant, the bootstrap grant can actually be created as a subset of the two above.
CONCLUSION
The above is a non comprehensive, high level view of what protocols needs, and what we could do as a DAO to satisfy this needs. To me, the next steps moving forward are pretty clear

find a way to turn the past STIP and the upcoming LTIPP in a continuous program with fair rules
deploying a pilot for a development program
deliver the above in the span of a few months, not quarters or semesters.

Again, there is ton to say here, ton to discuss and ton that is missing: audits and security, what to do with both good and mercenary protocols coming from other chains, how to create rules that are just not the equivalent of a state sponsored subsidisation but that also can let any good protocol spin up better and faster a new product, segmentation of programs through not only scope but also size, etcetera. I am also pretty sure I missed some programs that are live (like UAGP or others).
I really hope that nobody here gets offended by any lack of info in this post, because the goal here is: let’s start having a real public discussion on the next steps regarding what our DAO can do to favour builders.
Because without builders there is no Arbitrum.",1

It seems to me that the most promising first point is the transfer of existing projects to the Arbitrum platform, so that everything that is in Ethereum will also be in Arbitrum. This will give a competitive advantage, since the cost of gas will be significantly lower.",5
21184,dk3,2024-02-12 18:46:37,"One thing I think about a lot is loyalty; sure, we want to incentivize others to move over into Arbitrum, but other chains are doing the same to have projects expand into their ecosystems.  It is kind of a pain to deploy on multiple chains, but if the incentives are right and you are trying to stay competitive, it can easily make economic sense. Need a method to A) evaluate pound for pound spend (I think we can just keep things simple and do ARB grant spend to network fees generated.) B) Prioritize projects with Arbitrum as HQ, C) keep a modest amount available for projects that continue to punch above their weight class/median and commit to remaining on Arbitrum, so projects like ourselves don’t have to spend time thinking about the new wave of L2s about to drop and how they fit into the business plan.

Main net has an amount of liquidity that L2 will always dream of. Some stuff is literally doable only on main net because of the size of liquidity, and not a single L2 can’t unfortunately satisfy this requirement (yet, but I also think in future).
In general tho, yes, if there is a way to do X on main net, you would want to do it on Arbitrum as well. But most of the project that gun for cheap gas/fast tx, are already deployed either on Arbi or another L2, and I can’t think about projects that are on main net that would benefit from an L2 and didn’t approach this expansion/migration already.",8
21184,danielo,2024-02-13 22:24:01,"With the ArbitrumDAO+RnDAO Co.Lab, we’re taking a 3 phases approach to solve the migration issue for Bootstrap phase, and I think that could be replicated in other programs too:
1: selecting projects that are Arbitrum aligned (can generate sequencer fees and/or are solving a major problem for Arbitrum)
2: network effects through a Business Cluster approach (facilitating deep collaboration between projects in the same vertical) that’s taken to the next level through cross-ownership. This setup incentivizes modularity and composability, and it’s thanks to the integrations that network effects are archived (it’s way harder to convince all your partners to migrate than doing it alone). More on this here: Business Clusters as a Strategy for Arbitrum
3: incentive alignment: medium term we’re working to setup the legal and governance infrastructure so the ArbitrumDAO can be a co-owner of the projects too, participating in their governance as a stakeholder and even if the projects migrate, participating still in their success.",9

I’d add that for Boostrap Grants, what our research shows is that the key is really offering A LOT of hands-on support (not just mentorship or advise). That’s why Venture Builders are offering better success rates, ROI, and time to series A than accelerators/incubators.
Early-stage teams don’t have a lot of skills in-house, so they can really benefit from fractional cofounders that help them move faster and can reinvent the learnings from one cohort to the next.
That being said, that model only works well when there’s a vertical focus, instead of a generalist program.  It takes a lot of expertise to give good advise, so it’s best to be focused and not give generalist recipes.",10

That would help with:

Long term alignment / Loyalty risk
More loose KPIs acceptable for early stage projects
Less risk for the DAO

I think the Arbitrum ecosystem right now is missing a key element for the success of its apps: an onchain onramp and distribution channel.
In the Superchain ecosystem, this happens via Coinbase and Base. The amount of people that will be brought onchain by Coinbase alone will dwarf all current users.
This is a huge value proposition for builders, that goes beyond pure financial incentives.
How, as a DAO, can we create other powerful channels to create awareness for dapps built on Arbitrum, and easily onboard new people?
How can those become attractive for builders?
How can we incentivize some of those channels to fully align to Arbitrum?",11

favorable ruling on r/Cryptocurrency for Arbitrum.
Motivation
r/Cryptocurrency is the biggest crypto community since 2013, this proposal allow maintaining Arbitrum dominance by sponsoring the subreddit, and implement Arbitrum into the community (Ads, discussion, favorable governance).
Moons are the biggest token on Nova, this operation will help Arbitrum Nova grow by TVL, activity and brand awareness.
Specifications
• r/Cryptocurrency Banner - Arbitrum Logo
• Automatic Sponsored Post - Automatic post explaining and introducing Arbitrum - posted in 6hours intervals.
• Aquire 2M Moons for Arbitrum Treasury - Use in case of emergency or unfavorable governance polls that can hurt Arbitrum directly or indirectly.
Steps to Implement


Contact r/Cryptocurrency Mods and settle the dates and prices.


Aquire Moons For Advertising Until EOY:


Banner:
Price per day ~6,000 Moons
Price per month ~180,000 Moons
Price Until EOY (June-December) ~2,160,000 Moons
Sponsored Post:
Price per day ~1,800 Moons
Price per month ~54,000 Moons
Price Until EOY (June-December) ~378,000 Moons


Send Moons to burn address and start the takeover.


Aquire another 2M Moons for Arbitrum Treasury.


Approximate Total - 4,538,000 Moons
Timeline
Takeover Will be in June until December 2024.
Dates of the anticipated bull run cycle.
Acquiring Moons for goverance can start after the approval immediately.
Overall Cost
The approximate cost for the whole operation is around 450,000 ARB at today’s rate.
FAQ
Q - In what situations the acquired Moons can be used in goverance?
A - in situations where there’s threat to Arbitrum influence on the subreddit and Moons, for example other L2 posting proposal to move Moons to their chain, take APE Coin incident as similar example
Q - What’s the benefits for acquiring 2M Moons for governance?
A - Crypto is about community, making sure r/CC is always pro Arbitrum is critical for Arbitrum Dominance.
Some other Layer2 can offer r/CC to move Moons from Arbitrum to their Chain for some incentives, or create governance poll that makes their own takeover like this proposal and diminishes Arbitrum influence on the subreddit.
Q - What’s the current impact of 2M Moons on governance polls?
A - Currently the Qourom is 6M Moons so 2M is 33%
Q - What’s the importance of the Takeover?
A - r/Cryptocurrency is the biggest Crypto community on the internet since 13’, in year of bullrun, there’s massive influx of retail and new investors to this subreddit, they come to learn and begin their crypto journey.
The best Arbitrum can get is making their first crypto experience to be Arbitrum!
Arbitrum Banner - the first thing they see when entering the subreddit, Arbitrum Sponsored Post Every 6 hours that helps them learn about Arbitrum.
And of course, Moons which is distributed to new users based on their activity- is on Arbitrum.
Q:  Moons?
A: Goverance tokens of r/Cryptocurrency, deployed by Reddit Inc in 2022 on Arbitrum Nova, in late 2023 Reddit renounced Moons contract and burned their 40M Moons which made Moons completely decentralized runned by the community.
Moons are distributed to the active members of the subreddit, can be used for tipping, governance voting and shaping the subreddit, buying membership and key to  advertising on the subreddit - advertisers burn Moons to advertise.
Moons are live on Arbitrum Nova, they’re coming to Arbitrum ONE this month.
Currently the mods are working on Moons DAO legal entity which will go live in the upcoming weeks.",1
22352,dk3,2024-03-12 07:07:18,"idk Reddit Co abandoned their Nova DAC responsibilities. I know Reddit Co is not the same as the subreddit community, but still it was sad to see.",2
22352,MeLLoN98,2024-03-12 08:33:11,"That’s very true, they even stopped the Community Points program.
You can say Reddit “betrayed” their own users by this move, after that, the community united to keep the project going- decentralized this time.
But that’s got nothing to do with this proposal, Moons is the native token of r/Cryptocurrency which is the “leading” token on Nova.
Well because Reddit did that, I believe the DAO should jump in and help it grow, not the other way.
I believe that Moons is the prime example of Social Apps that can live on Nova, pushing Moons can bring big attention to Nova and possibly onboard more similar projects to launch on Nova.",5

The Project So Far…
The project began in January 2024, and since then, the involved teams have been working on optimizing the networks and the new Arbitrum website for Spanish-speaking users for its official launch. With a focus on community growth and education, the project has aimed to maintain contact with the LATAM communities, create original content, and disseminate it while also planning for the future creation of offline events and talks at universities in the region, primarily in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia.

New Content & Updates
Arbitrum LATAM Website
The Arbitrum LATAM website was officially launched on February 22, and the results of the first week are encouraging. More than 150 unique visits demonstrate the interest of communities in Arbitrum and the content being generated through the project, and we expect that number to grow over the next month. During March we’ll begin the diffusion of the content generated up to this point by the teams. Additionally, the website will receive periodic updates featuring March’s content. The project’s goal is to enhance engagement with communities and prioritize growth moving forward.
A website subscription feature has also been implemented for users seeking to receive news directly to their email inbox.
First Analytics

As previously mentioned, over the past month, the website has welcomed more than 150 new users, with the website launch being the peak of interest.
Demographic analytic

The website has attracted visitors from across the globe, with a notable majority coming from users in the Americas. Specifically, Argentina, Venezuela, Mexico, and the United States have been the primary visitors thus far, while Spain, Peru, and Brazil have also shown significant engagement.
Session analytics

We can see that most of the unique visits to the website are from users referred from other users/communities and through the project’s social networks. The project will use current metrics to develop a comprehensive strategy for growth.
Educative Articles
The educational articles, which are created with a pedagogical focus and using the didactic transposition method, have proliferated once again. This month, we have 5 new ever-green articles that will serve the entire Spanish-speaking community:

Educative Article 4: ARB Token
Educative Article 5: Arbitrum Use Cases

Production
The teams involved in the project have worked hard throughout February, leading to a surplus of content for the official website launch. A new batch of ever-green content and informative content is already available on the site.
Atoma has managed to produce 5 new educational articles  throughout the month, in addition to the 3 podcast episodes stipulated, once again exceeding the estimated amount of content. Currently, there are 10 educational articles, surpassing the 9 promised by the end of the domain. During the last month of the domain, the aim is to reach 15 articles, which would represent a decent increase compared to the initial target or baseline milestone. Additionally, a new series of informative podcasts will begin, exceeding expectations on the Spotify network milestones.
Solow has also created extra articles for LinkedIn, increasing the promised deliverables for February by a third. An increase in production is expected to have two articles/informative pieces per week for this network throughout March, thus achieving a 100% increase in content generation during the month.
—
What’s Next?
The month of March will consolidate the first phase of the Arbitrum LATAM project. With a solid content foundation, a burgeoning community, and plenty of energy, the teams will focus on continuing to provide new content for the region while also concentrating on the growth and education of communities through various methods, including talks at universities and collaboration with other projects, and in-person events in the region in the near future.

Ongoing Content Production

The team will maintain a robust content production schedule as stated in its proposal, releasing weekly articles, educational articles, videos, tutorials, and monthly newsletter during March.


University Classes and Future Partnerships

The Atoma team will conduct 1-2 university classes in Argentina during  March. The first class will be in the UNCUYO for the diploma in cryptoeconomics in late March, and will serve as an introduction to Arbitrum and its basic aspects. If you want to read class syllabus you can check this link.

Anyone interested in participating in this diploma can join using the following link.


In collaboration with the Solow team, a second class is being prepared for the ITBA.
The project is actively collaborating with various regional universities to develop a class schedule for 2024. Additionally, it is establishing partnerships with different projects across Latin America to participate in various community calls in the future.


Collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation

In collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation, efforts will be made to  establish gaming incentives in partnership with Treassure and Xai throughout March. We want to thank @cliffton.eth along with the rest of members of the AF for their collaboration with the project.
The project will also try to secure an official subdomain for the www.arbitrumlatam.com website.

Project will also work to improve and optimize the current website during March.




Explore Potential New Uses for Current Networks

During March we’ll begin developing informative Podcast episodes in a new series for the platform.
Also we’ll explore new ways of using the current communicational channels (such as Spotify and YouTube), including collaboration with other projects from the LATAM region, interviews to members of the DAO, coffee hours, and more.


Investigate the Potential for Hosting an In-person Event in Buenos Aires, Argentina

This exploration will involve assessing venue options, estimating budget requirements, and identifying potential partners or collaborators for the event.
This initiative would enable us to interact in person with the community we’re building. Also, this event could also attract attention from individuals outside the typical web3 niche through difussion in universities, thus broadening our reach and diversifying our audience.
We aim to spark curiosity, inspire involvement, and foster a sense of belonging among attendees, ultimately strengthening our project’s impact and influence in the region.


Development of a Survey for the LATAM Community

In the near future the project aims to conduct a survey to understand the Arbitrum community’s demographics and preferences. This survey will gather insights into the community’s age, country of origin, gender distribution, education level, employment status, income, and cryptocurrency usage.
This data-driven approach will help the teams tailor the educational resources and outreach efforts effectively, fostering a more informed and engaged community around Arbitrum in Latin America.

20916,tnorm,2024-01-29 01:48:01,"Introduction
Over the past five months since the Arbitrum DAO introduced the Short Term Incentives Program, significant progress has been made, with over 71.4M ARB granted to 56 projects. New proposals and programs have emerged, including the LTIPP and ARDC, alongside key infrastructure grants in areas like open data, KPIs, and analytics.
This post consolidates feedback from a series of interviews conducted by @tnorm and aims to synthesize lessons from the DAO’s status post-STIP. It reflects on the progress, lessons, and collective views of the Arbitrum community. These insights offer many actionable learnings for future endeavors.
The following summary combines opinions and responses of these Arbitrum DAO community members and are not reflective of @tnorm’s personal opinion nor advice or recommendations for the Arbitrum community.
A special thanks to all contributors who shared their perspectives on STIP, incentives, and the future of the DAO.
Lessons From STIP
What Worked Well

Decentralization: Respondents felt that the formative discussions and program design were open, transparent, collaborative, and relatively decentralized. They felt feedback was incorporated and the program was adjusted appropriately throughout its lifecycle.
Community: Feedback consistently pointed to an increase in DAO growth and participation following STIP. Increased engagement from delegates, protocols, service providers, and prospective builders was largely seen as a large success.
Visibility: STIP raised the profile of Arbitrum and the willingness of the DAO to support builders. While STIP focused on awarding existing projects, the program proved the DAO was able to design, approve, and execute large-scale grants for the ecosystem.
Accountability: Generally, respondents felt that the streaming mechanism, the clawbacks, and the multisig were generally effective in keeping grantees accountable. Teams felt OpenBlock was respectful but thorough in asking for details in their data aggregation.
Ecosystem Support: Respondents felt the program was essential for the Arbitrum DAO’s positioning and reputation as an entity capable of supporting its ecosystem.

What Worked Poorly

Communications: The decentralized nature of the DAO meant that the program was only known by those directly active in the community. Despite nearly 100 applications, the program’s rapid pace meant that many projects were left scrambling to submit an application and/or missed on the program entirely.
Application and Review Process: Feedback on the process was mixed: some felt the application was a success given its status as a community initiative, while others found it chaotic and hard to navigate due to numerous requirements. Most agreed the aggressive timeline hindered thorough proposal review, and delegates’ lack of expertise in incentive design led to insufficient critical evaluation of any closely reviewed proposals.
Consensus: Direct delegate voting was unfeasible with the amount of applications submitted. Many delegates were traumatized by this event, and using Snapshot was questioned as a means to conduct similar votes in the future. In general, most felt councils would be a more appropriate format.
Operations: A lack of structure between the DAO and Foundation meant operations were stressed from legal structure to KYC to fund disbursement. A silver lining is that the program created important foundational workflows and infrastructure was laid for future programs.
Strategic Direction: The lack of strategic direction led to inefficiencies in grantee evaluation, confusion, and difficulties in evaluating STIP’s success - especially given the size of the spending approved by the DAO.

Biggest Lessons for the DAO
STIP’s journey was challenging for all involved, yet it resulted in some remarkable achievements. However, many lessons from STIP are still revealing themselves and may not be openly shared within the community. A few I think are worth highlighting:
1. Hesitance to Speak Up
Learning: Many folks are hesitant to openly speak their mind. The power dynamics of DAOs mean delegates, service providers, contributors, projects, and stakeholders are often afraid to speak honestly and risk stepping on someone’s toes.
Lesson: Don’t be afraid to speak your mind, welcome constructive criticism. The DAO improves only when the culture is allowed to respectfully challenge itself and build better solutions.
2. Objectives are Important
Learning: The main goal of STIP was to design an acceptable enough framework that it would allow the DAO to approve short-term grants. The lack of a larger specific objective created a difficult job for those analyzing the onchain effects for the DAO because STIP lacked clear objectives, other than experimentation.
Thus, it’s unclear whether the validity and success of any STIP grant should be evaluated on its effect on the network (as no clear objective was defined) or rather based the evaluation of each experiment’s individual goals.
Lesson: To effectively evaluate strategic alignment with Arbitrum DAO, future programs must define clear objectives. The mistake of STIP shouldn’t be repeated - or if it is, the expectation must be set that a project should not be punished for the faults of the program that awarded the grant.
3. Intention Before Inclusivity
Learning: Facing the reality that no incentive grant had passed, STIP was designed to be as vague, and inclusive, as possible. As such, grant requirements were made extremely stringent to enforce alignment, at the expense of experimentation.
Lesson: A more intentional program allows for greater experimentation. STIP purposefully bifurcated the strategy and the tactics (to include as many projects as possible). The program’s goal was largely unclear, a point that was hammered home by many and has created many difficulties in measuring impact (1, 2).
4. Bad Habits
Learning: Seemingly dozens of ideas, proposals, and working groups have spun out in the months following STIP. Many respondents felt while the activity is great, the DAO has mistakenly used STIP as a model for future programs, interpreting it as a framework to build on, in contrast to its purpose as a one-off program to learn from. Many felt STIPs precedent hindered future program design.
Lesson: Original thinking from original principles is necessary to design better and improved grant programs. STIP should be learned from to design new programs from the ground up, rather than as a guiding example.
Looking Forward
In addition to lessons from STIP, respondents were also asked to provide feedback on their perception of the DAO in its current state, and their opinions and desires for future Incentives programs. A few themes arose which I think are worth covering briefly:
Themes of the DAO
1. Bigger and (probably) Better
The overwhelming consensus from respondents was that Arbitrum DAO was the most interesting and involved DAO in the ecosystem and had grown considerably following the launch of STIP. Many found the momentum encouraging but the amount of proposals, programs, and activities overwhelming.
2. Lack of Trust
Many respondents shared a mutual frustration with a perceived rise in lobbying, politics, and distrustful aspects of Arbitrum governance. Respondent verbiage ranged from corruption to favoritism to ignorance. There is frustration from many protocol teams that feel as though its a necessity to hire a DAO political respondent to maintain influence in the DAO both giving larger protocols an advantage and creating complicated power structures (1, 2).
Many felt that the open conversations and program design during STIP had regressed to conversations by private parties. This made providing feedback more difficult and affected respondents’ trust in programs and elected councils.
3. Lack of Leadership
Several felt the DAO needed clarity from its founding fathers (Offchain Labs/Arbitrum Foundation) to help guide its initiatives. There’s a general desire for these entities to play a larger role in providing strategic direction and guidance for the ecosystem. Many respondents expressed confusion about the greater Arbitrum Orbit strategy and how the DAO should prioritize and support the initiative.
Several respondents felt that the AIP 1 controversy left both the Foundation and Offchain Labs alienated from the DAO, leading to an estranged relationship under which the ecosystem would continue to suffer without greater strategic clarity or realignment.
4. No One Size Fits All
A consensus was that a one-fits-all program was likely not feasible for the diversity of use cases and variability in grant size for DAO incentives. Most respondents felt that programs should have a specific focus whether that be the size of grants, a certain KPI/metric, or a strategic objective.
5. Moving Quickly
Several respondents expressed significant concern over the velocity of programs following STIP. Some expressed frustration with the DAO’s velocity to launch new problems before understanding and learning from STIP’s results. Many harped on a need for data-driven analysis to inform programs and ingest takeaways.
Respondents expressed similar concern over substantial spending without clear objectives or learnings from previous outcomes. This suggests a gap in understanding how best to allocate resources.
How Would You Distribute Incentives on Arbitrum?
A key component of each interview was an opportunity for the respondent to describe how, given full control, they would distribute incentives on Arbitrum. While independent respondents differed, a few patterns and ideas emerged that are worth sharing below. In an attempt to simplify these learnings and increase digestibility for the community, these can broadly be organized as:

Project-centric Strategies
Metric-centric Strategies
Objective-centric Strategies.

Project-centric Strategies
Tiered Program Strategy
Most respondents brought up a need for project-based incentives focused on the stages of growth. A recurring trend was a vision that comprised three programs with specific objectives across multiple tiers.


Small Projects:

Objective: Support innovative early-stage projects and encourage them to become native Arbitrum projects.
Target Audience: Small projects with niche, unique, or innovative use-cases that may not have product market fit, but have a high growth potential. They may lack resources to get off the ground, have less than a year of runway.
Funding Level: Recommendations ranged from 100K to 1M depending on the respondent, but the common comparison was to liken these grants to seed funding.
Governance: Council focused on weekly grants, low admin & high throughput.
Velocity: High cadence, high churn,



Medium Projects:

Objective: Scale up projects that have traction and achieved growth in the sector.
Target: Projects with a proven product and can point to a track record of metrics, usage, and market fit. Proven ability to manage incentives over a 3-6 month period.
Funding Level: Around 1M ARB grants, drawn from a set budget per quarter.
Criteria: Clear ability to hit pre-defined KPIs and Objectives, large enough to be self-supported. Potential to reach a higher tier of demand and growth.
Governance: Larger council than small, focused on quality of project and grant purpose over throughput.



Large Projects:

Objective: Provide large investment grants to support sophisticated and strategic objectives.
Target: Top protocols on Arbitrum with a clear track record of success and a clear strategic roadmap.
Funding Level: No limit, the most wiggle room but the highest level of oversight, strategy, and requirements.
Governance: A council or advisor with a partnership-style approach (potential oversight/collaboration with Arbitrum Foundation/OCL). These are adults providing white-glove service by providing advisory and strategic investments when needed.



Objective-centric Strategies
Sticky Users
Consistent and high-quality wallets were a common priority for many of the protocol teams interviewed. DeFi and onchain activity are inherently financial and thus users tend towards mercenary behavior. Many respondents felt incentive programs were well-positioned to analyze the habits of these users and design programs that retain quality users. An emphasis from respondents on users was establishing a definition of users most valuable to the ecosystem, and targeting them specifically.
As one respondent aptly put it: “A weird thing with this space is there’s more infra than protocols and more protocols than users. Users are the kingmakers”.
Native Projects and Tokens
Multiple respondents brought up strategies to increase native token distribution on Arbitrum. These included:


Native Strategic Assets:

Incentive programs to support strategic bluechip assets minted on Arbitrum. This includes supporting integrations with key strategic partners to help incentivize capital deployment on Arbitrum for native Arbitrum minting (one respondent noted native minting is essential for institutional adoption for security/legal/operational reasons).
This includes supporting partners such as:

BitGo (wBTC)
Circle (USDC)
Lido (stETH/wstETH)
Tether (USDT)


Native arbitrum minting of yield-bearing assets:

LSTs
RWAs




Native Tokens:

Providing incentives for projects that agree to launch tokens on Arbitrum creates both long-term alignment w/ Arbitrum native projects and supports outsized value creation helping metrics such as TVL.



Arbitrum Orbit
An aforementioned lack of communication around the Foundation and OCL’s strategy permeated a general desire of respondents to support deployments on the Arbitrum Orbit stack. While some pointed to grants as an essential priority, others felt uncertain of the importance of these chains given the DAO’s lack of a cohesive strategic goal.
Metric-centric Strategies
Sequencer Revenue
Multiple respondents noted that targeting programs focused on the immediate optimization of sequencer revenue would be a part of their strategy. However, optimizing revenue was often presented as a complementary strategy in tandem with additional programs to support long-term projects on Arbitrum. Most felt sequencer revenue was an appropriate long-term objective for the DAO.
Liquidity
Multiple respondents noted liquidity as an important metric for Arbitrum dominance in the marketplace. Those respondents calling for TVL as a metric often expressed a preference for native tokens over bridged assets, due to their stickiness to the ecosystem.",1
20916,Immutablelawyer,2024-01-29 11:05:20,"Well done on putting this together @tnorm !
I personally think that given this post-mortem assessment, it’s well worth hosting a couple of discussions to tackle each section so that this valuable feedback does not die out.
Some points from my end that I earmarked and that I feel are very relevant and valuable moving forward:
“Many respondents felt while the activity is great, the DAO has mistakenly used STIP as a model for future programs, interpreting it as a framework to build on, in contrast to its purpose as a one-off program to learn from. Many felt STIPs precedent hindered future program design”
“Some expressed frustration with the DAO’s velocity to launch new problems before understanding and learning from STIP’s results. Many harped on a need for data-driven analysis to inform programs and ingest takeaways”
“Respondents expressed similar concern over substantial spending without clear objectives or learnings from previous outcomes. This suggests a gap in understanding how best to allocate resources”
“The overwhelming consensus from respondents was that Arbitrum DAO was the most interesting and involved DAO in the ecosystem and had grown considerably following the launch of STIP. Many found the momentum encouraging but the amount of proposals, programs, and activities overwhelming”
"" Learning: Many folks are hesitant to openly speak their mind. The power dynamics of DAOs mean delegates, service providers, contributors, projects, and stakeholders are often afraid to speak honestly and risk stepping on someone’s toes.
Lesson: Don’t be afraid to speak your mind, welcome constructive criticism. The DAO improves only when the culture is allowed to respectfully challenge itself and build better solutions""",2
20916,pedrob,2024-01-29 12:18:13,"This is great. Thank you very much.
I believe that with the programs already implemented, along with the ongoing approved programs, we have a solid foundation for the DAO to enter a sort of “period of reflection” (a concept from Optimism). In Optimism, Reflection Periods are a time for delegates to reflect on what’s been going well and what can be improved.
It’s time for the DAO to reach a wide consensus on ‘what the DAO wants to do’ with its funds. In my opinion, there’s a need for a debate to align short-, mid-, and long-term objectives, and based on that, develop suitable grant/incentives frameworks.
This post is a great starting point for discussion. The approved research bounty in LTIPP will aid in discussing and developing frameworks with a better understanding of what has worked, what hasn’t, and what needs to be done more efficiently.",3
20916,pfedprog,2024-01-31 20:02:33,"Personally, I believe that the core component is data and its fair assessment by a community.
I know, we, arbitrum dao have a sporadic way of working together such as congregating in tg groups such as that of kpi working group:
image652×897 184 KB
But there should be a way to track and actively monitor grants data transparently.
For example, STIP Monitoring - Objective 1 & 2 - OpenBlock Labs - [FINAL]
provides a very easy to export data that can be used for calculating KPIs.
However, what is missing, in my opinion, is the transparent communication between grant recipients and arbitrum dao community at large. For example, on challenges at hand and grant completion. Not necessarily the overly involved dictator manager, but just a friendly reminder on what is going on.",4
20916,Sinkas,2024-02-01 16:00:28,"I believe these learnings are extremely valuable so thanks for putting these together @tnorm. I like extensive reports and access to raw data just as much as anyone, but I think we need more of these “digestible” reflections of different initiatives that the average participant can understand and discuss.
I’m curious about how many people you interviewed before compiling this information and whether it was only participants that actively contributed to the STIP working group?",5
20916,tnorm,2024-02-01 16:39:23,"I talked with ~15 people individually, these interviews were specifically focused on the Working Group and folks involved in the original STIP (w/ some variance).
It would be well worth extending this interview process to the greater community…not sure what that looks like practically, however. To the point of a few of the Biggest Lesson takeaways, I think the best thing folks can do to bring this type of reflection forward is 1) bring the discussion back to the forums for the more technical/serious discussions around design, budgets, etc. and 2) just speak their minds. Feedback needs to be active and honest.
I would definitely encourage anyone who feels they have more to add either complete the survey, comment below, or reach out!",6

20980,blanklee,2024-01-31 09:05:04,"Proposal: Experimental Incentive Program for Arbitrum Game Builders(for Discussion)
Proposer
Hello ArbitrumDAO,
I am Blank, the co-founder of Scattering, the instant liquidity market for NFTs on Arbitrum, and RentFun, the NFT rental protocol on Arbitrum, which is also a grant winner from the foundation.
Having been a small builder in the games and NFT space on Arbitrum for over a year, I aspire to see Arbitrum become the best and only home for decentralized games like TreasureDAO. This vision is crucial for our business, which relies on the success of Arbitrum and its games/NFTs.
Therefore, I am presenting this proposal to ensure that the voices of games/NFT builders are heard. If you observe, the majority of forum proposals come from DeFi protocols discussing incentives, while there are very few from game builders. The Arbitrum DAO should seriously consider why this discrepancy exists.
Please note: this proposal is not finalized yet, and it is only for discussion and check whether the ArbitrumDAO is interested in moving forward quickly to incentivize and grow the native game builders on arbitrum.
I’ve gleaned valuable insights from the post of Learnings from Stip Community Interview Summaries and Notes titled “Hesitance to Speak Up.”
Please pardon any errors in my contributions to this discussion thread. My sole intention is to contribute to the improvement of Arbitrum as a preferred platform for games like Treasuredao by expressing my genuine thoughts.

Abstract
It all began with the proposal of pitching TreasureDAO to build a superchain on the Op stack from Optimism (https://twitter.com/Fwiz/status/1752130755894120909), followed by the ZK Stack proposal (https://twitter.com/Ozhar/status/1752479114852815343).
Perhaps within the next 24 hours, another proposal may emerge to attract the TreasureDao team😂
For further insights into why TreasureDao has a compelling reason to engage in this discussion, I have elaborated on it in this post: https://twitter.com/Blanklee3/status/1752288907180552504.
TL;DR:

Treasure Chain is a new blockchain seeking incentives and funds to attract both treasure and new games in the future. However, they continue to rely on magic tokens, limiting the potential for significant incentives that a completely new chain could provide. This is a common and realistic challenge for new chains.
The Arbitrum DAO is somewhat dominated by DeFi space builders and degens. Consequently, there is insufficient voice and attention given to treasure and game builders, at least from the game builders’ perspective.
Undoubtedly, the Arbitrum Orbit Stack boasts the most user-friendly and customizable technology for the Treasure DAO team. This observation is widely acknowledged. Yet, as a small and new builder, I recognize that technical aspects alone may not guarantee 100% success for a new chain. Blast’s success, for instance, wasn’t solely due to technical factors. Therefore, if other chains like Optimism(Op) and zkSync offer better funding and support, and their technical capabilities are comparable, it is worth the Treasure team’s consideration for their optimal benefits.

My thoughts find expression in Karel’s response to AvgJoesCrypto’s argument, which can be viewed here: https://twitter.com/karelvuong/status/1752376789513453802
In this response, Karel expresses hope that the Arbitrum DAO will attract increased attention and support, enabling it to move swiftly despite its experimental nature and willingness to make bold bets.
The situation is straightforward. If the Arbitrum DAO intends to support TreasureDAO, which has made significant contributions to the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum, it should address their current situation. Continuing to focus solely on technical aspects (which are known to every Arbitrum enthusiast) may not be as beneficial in achieving this goal, if indeed there is a desire to support them.
Motivation
However, I don’t want to propose the incentive plans for TreasureDao in this proposal because Treasure has already attracted enough attention through this “competition” and possesses sufficient bargaining power. I believe that whether they choose arbitrage (arb) or operate (op), the Treasure team will secure the best deal in the end.
What I do want to propose is a plan for every small game builder on the Arbitrum or Orbit chains.
Are the Op or Zk advocating for the Treasure Team?
NO!
They are advocating for approximately 15 solid treasure games and communities standing behind Treasure. They are placing significant bets on web3 games, not on the Treasure team.
Therefore, ArbitrumDAO should focus more on how to make it a better home for all web3 game builders.
Only by doing this, will the TreasureDao team stay, and there may be a second or third “TreasureDao” on Arbitrum or Orbit chains.
Again, please don’t solely focus on the technical side; otherwise, Arbitrum Nova is already very successful, but we all know its current performance.
Therefore, I propose a dedicated Experimental Incentive Program for Games(EIPG), whether they are outside or inside of Treasure.
This plan involves quick funding for each game builder, providing 30K USDT-valued arb tokens from the treasury, with an easy and expedited process.
Specifications
Quoted from @AvgJoesCrypto: “Since the treasury holds 3.52 billion $ARB, it is the largest treasury in all of crypto. The Arbitrum DAO can spend just under $4 billion and still maintain its position as the largest treasury in the crypto space.”

Grant Program: Experimental Incentive Program for Games(EIPG) on Arbitrum and Orbit Chains
Objective:

The EIPG aims to provide timely and substantial financial support to game builders, developers of game-dev tools, and liquidity marketplaces for game NFTs on Arbitrum and Orbit Chains. This program seeks to empower new, small, medium, and established builders in the gaming ecosystem, fostering innovation and growth within a condensed time frame.
Expand the gaming sphere within the ARB, employing metrics such as transaction count, player presence (both on and off-chain), retention ratio, expenditure, player satisfaction, and playtime. Utilize these indicators as benchmarks to gauge the accomplishment of the stated objective.

Budget Allocation: 30M $ARB tokens
Grant Size((based on unique user base and NFTs market cap/trading volume) :

New and Small Builders: 30K USDT each with a streamlined 3-week review process
Medium Builders: 30K USDT to 100K USDT each with a comprehensive 4-week review process
Big Names: Budgets up to 1M USDT each, subject to a thorough 6-week review and voting process

Targeted Areas:

Game builders operating on Arbitrum or Orbit Chains
game-dev tools

Application Process:

Interested parties must submit grant applications detailing their project, goals, and budgetary requirements.
Review timelines vary based on the builder category, ensuring a balanced and efficient evaluation process.
Grant recipients are encouraged to expedite project development, maximizing the impact of the allocated funds.

Grant Committee:

A dedicated committee will be established to oversee the grant evaluation and decision-making process.
The committee will predominantly consist of esteemed game builders with recognized expertise on Arbitrum.
The committee could not vote for their own proposal.
And committee members should get a payout of $ARB that has to be stated so people will want to step forward to participate in the committee.

Key Considerations:

Emphasis on supporting projects that contribute to the growth and sustainability of the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum and Orbit Chains.
Transparent and inclusive decision-making processes, incorporating community input through a voting system.
Continuous improvement of the grant program based on feedback from the gaming community and evolving industry trends.

Conclusion
The Experimental Incentive Program for Games(EIPG) for games is designed to catalyze innovation and accelerate the development of games on Arbitrum and Orbit Chains.
By providing timely and substantial financial support, we aim to empower builders of all scales and contribute to the vibrant and dynamic gaming landscape within Arbitrum Eco.",1

Thank you for the interesting offer and detailed description.
I’ll make a few points:

I don’t yet see the difference between game development projects and DEFI. If game developers do not apply for funding, then this proposal will not change anything. Perhaps developers need to be made more aware that this possibility already exists.
Financing can be of 2 types. Grants, as you suggest, are intended to boost the product and the opportunity to show off at an early stage of development. A small cost of 30,000 EPIRBs is acceptable in this case. In the case of 1,000,000 ARB, in my opinion, only Investment is possible, that is, becoming a shareholder of the project, the owner of its part. Otherwise, the DAO may simply lose a large amount of funds without receiving any return.
If you create such a grant program, then it is worth doing the first stage with a small amount, as an experiment.

We have currently  applied to the funding round on jokerrace.
I am interested in more opportunities for small game developers to get funding or traction because usually this is the hardest part, and this sounds great but I think there should be more communication and real updates with a dated schedule to show the progress coming from the devs to acquire these funds.
I also think projects with already massive amounts of acquired funding should be less prioritized to give more opportunities to the new indie game devs.
From experience, It doesn’t take 100k to build an indie game that’s just a beta version of the app more like 5k - 20k to get started assuming the dev already has the hardware and software to build. After that then there should be a second round of funds  allocated after the first funding batch to initialize the devs.",4

Proposal: Experiental Incentive Program for Arbitrum Game Builders(for Discussion)

Quoted from @AvgJoesCrypto: “Since the treasury holds 3.52 billion $ARB, it is the largest treasury in all of crypto. The Arbitrum DAO can spend just under $4 billion and still maintain its position as the largest treasury in the crypto space.”


First, I would like to mention that I’m a bit concerned that having “the largest treasury in the crypto space” is mentioned as a reason to spend, I think it’s something we should stop bringing up (both in this and the other proposals). Arbitrum DAO must take care of its treasury and its spending should be sustainable in the long term regardless of its size.

On the other hand, you have mentioned that this would be an experimental program, while I agree that the industry has potential, using almost 1% of the treasury in an “experiment” exclusively dedicated to gaming is overly generous as @Jl_DefiEdge said. To give some context, it has recently been voted to fund with 45.8M ARB a long-term incentives program that is iterating the STIP and is covering several arbitrum ecosystem verticals.

Continuous improvement of the grant program based on feedback from the gaming community and evolving industry trends.


I believe that the proposal in general lacks consideration of the follow-up of funded projects, as well as their duties to report updates. All of this is essential for the community to provide genuine feedback.
Finally, I suggest that instead of continuing to create isolated grant programs for different aspects of the ecosystem, we should focus on generating a framework that will serve as a basis for awarding grants throughout the entire arbitrum ecosystem.

Using a high ceiling for a budget does not suggest the actual budget implementation will be that high. If the program continues to prove successful, the DAO should want the budget to be utilized up to the ceiling. However, it would benefit the DAO in advance to establish the metrics it would want to measure individual projects and the incentive program as a whole.

Unfortunately must agree. In order to provide a committee a large budget, it should have both a structure and defined processes. This should not count against the idea of this particular fund, but as proposed there is a remarkable lack of substance for a large ARB distribution.

Structuring a Successful Gaming Program
A successful gaming program could take many forms. One example could be as follows:
First ringfence funds through a vote, without providing unilateral control to a particular committee or even moving the funds. Make this a green light, to approve the structure of the program considered.
A small portion of those funds could be set aside in a multisg for operations to fund reviews by a due diligence committee (e.g. 1000 ARB for 5 people to review for 2 hours). Proposals must then meet pre-determined criteria to qualify for a review. The initial hard work goes into the template and basic gatekeeping. The high bar for applicants elicits a better signal to noise.
These proposals could be reviewed by the committee, if it meets certain criteria it can be approved to go to vote. Approved proposals could then be bundled and voted on as a set or individual on some cadence that is not burdensome to governance. Once you have the first round of successful projects, you fund the multisig in accordance with defined operating procedures.
Proposals only 500k ARB or above could be considered to start, this means either you get people investing the work upfront with the appropriate talent, or not. With a high floor you reduce the number of applicants and reviews are easier.
Regardless, there are plenty of solid ways to structure something like this, but it requires work and time. A good step would just be to set aside a modest budget to fund proposals to structure an EIPG properly.
Would be happy to help if people genuinely want to support gaming.",7

Apologies for the delayed response; I had been anticipating feedback on this proposal within the Proposals section. However, after noticing the lack of response over the past few days, I refrained from circling back.
While initially proposing the LTIPP program for Scattering, I observed that my proposal had been shifted from the proposal topic to the grant discussion topic.
You’re correct in pointing out that this proposal seems more suited for discussion to gather feedback from the DAO and optimize it accordingly. Moreover, I aim to use this opportunity to emphasize the significance of gaming builders on Arbitrum to the DAO.
However, it appears that there may not be a necessity for this approach, given that XAI and Treasuredao have already introduced a gaming proposal. In light of this, I won’t pursue further action on this proposal and instead defer to their proposal for the benefit of gaming builders on Arbitrum.",8

21235,EventHorizonDAO,2024-02-14 00:53:12,"The Problem
After attending several Arbitrum Working Group and Open Governance calls for the past several weeks we wanted to flag a concern that has come up various times. Despite the size and activity level of the Arbitrum ecosystem, the DAO itself has a small number of active participants. As of Feb 9, the last 10 Arbitrum Snapshot proposals saw an average 27,598 wallets participate. This is in light of the 921,457 ARB holders (895,477 on L2, 25,980 on L1). This results in an average participation rate <3%. Retail is not voting.
This strikes us as a problem. Granted, this is a problem insofar as we accept the following:
Axiom: A democratic system is more robust the more opinions are heard.
We can motivate this assumption by recognizing that while 99% of new ideas might fail, a crucial competitive edge is likely to come from that 1%. Over 97% of ARB holders are currently sidelined, likely due to the unfortunately rational conclusion that their small retail holdings won’t move the needle in a governance vote and aren’t worth the hassle. But it’s also likely true that that 1% of winning ideas is currently sitting idle in the head of a member of that long tail distribution of retail ARB holders.
tl;dr: Our suggestion is that we brainstorm more ways to increase the variance of idea generation in the Arbitrum DAO, to increase voter participation. Let a 1000 blossoms bloom.
Constraining the solution space
Whenever the topic of grants comes up, it’s important to remain grounded.
@SeriousPeople underscored this in their Forum post on KPIs. They argued (with broad community support) that we ought to pay closer attention to how Arbitrum Grants benefit the ecosystem. Some formulae were thrown around before @danielo wisely pointed out, with the support of others including @DisruptionJoe, the danger of being wed to measurables.
The space of possible beneficial projects to the ecosystem is significantly larger than the space of measurable beneficial projects. Not everything can be reduced to a KPI, and KPIs are often gameable. In short, “not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”
Does this mean we throw caution to the wind? Of course not. Thankfully, when considering boosting retail participation, there is a no-cost way of doing so: delegation, not grants.
Without having to emit any ARB tokens, the DAO can reward active retail participants with governance authority. One advantage to this approach is that it attracts governance-interested folks, not capital-chasing mercenaries as can be the case with outright grants.
Delegation is already a common solution for getting knowledgeable parties to vote with meaningful authority in the ecosystem. But we view delegates as just one part of the three major stakeholders (the other two being team/investors and retail). Of these three pillars, all are well represented except retail, so to that end we want to open up a conversation about how we can leverage delegation in novel ways to bring more retail to the table.
We took a stab at some initial ideas, but would love to brainstorm up some more ideas worth pursuing. Some initial ideas include:


Retroactive delegation en masse: finding the most active, but smallest voters on the DAO and rewarding them with more authority. To make a dent on participation rates we would have to agree to some hurdle rates (number of votes taken, earliest vote, etc). Uniswap recently did something similar, albeit on a much smaller scale than we envision


Delegating to a publicly accessible governance pool: delegating to a sub-DAO where retail can freely or easily join to vote with an increase voice than they otherwise would be able to (disclaimer: this is a solution we’re actively working on)


Conclusion
It’s in Arbitrum’s best interest to bring more retail voices to the table. The best way to do that is by increasing the scope of delegation to active participants. Some preliminary ideas include retroactive delegation en masse, and delegation to a sub-DAO. Delegation, not grants, provide an easy, no-cost solution to the problem of low voter turnout. But this is just our initial thoughts. We’re looking forward to hearing from the rest of the community about other interesting ways to leverage delegation as a means of bringing more retail voices to the table thereby empowering hitherto now neglected 3rd pillar of DAO governance.",1

Sub-DAOs are one area I’d like to explore more.
I was playing around https://www.party.app/ and the concept of a small group of people gathering around a mission, an objective, having internal processes, then dissolving when things are done, can be very powerful.
I imagine someone very passionate about topics like sustainability or UX (so topics beyond self-recursive DAO sectors) wanting to gather around value-aligned peers to discuss some solutions, initiatives, come out with a proposal, get the budget approved and then present the results to the main DAO.
This is partially happening with the working groups but we could further explore how to empower these entities for the long run.",3

I can see delegation to a pool that votes based on how small votes are cast really taking off in the DAO. I would note though that large delegates already consider how small voters are voting before casting their own, so in some senses it is implictly baked in as soft power. Event Horizon proposes converting this influence of small voters into hard power, which i think is a great step.
At the same time, i dont really see the need for a proposal to get started on this. I would recommend Event Horizon self-delegate whatever ARB it can, even if it is only 1000 or so. Then show the proof of concept that this 1000 ARB is programmatically voting based on the wishes of smaller voters, and approach large holders (and eventually the DAO) to delegate to this pool.



 EventHorizonDAO:

As i was chatting with @DisruptionJoe yesterday, I am actually opposed to giving participants voting rights without the token itself as it leads to disalignment.
With only increased governance, participants will earn income by being a power broken which is maybe not what we want. With increased governance and a token, participants earn income by making good decisions and increasing the value of ARB, which is what we definitely want.
I really welcome this conversation. Currently there is “Arbitrum Royalty” or delegates with greater than 7-8 million ARB who call the shots on whether proposals pass. As a first step, i’d love to see Event Horizon enter the gilded ranks of royalty via automated redistribution of their power to the smaller voters, whose voice we need to amplify.",6

I currently work for JonesDao, a core and native Arbitrum protocol. Having served as a strategist for over a year, I have assisted in designing and implementing cutting-edge products on Arbitrum. Examples include jGLP (a leveraged version of GLP, the primary liquidity token of GMX), jUSDC (a yield-bearing stablecoin built on top of GLP), and Metavaults (an innovative product that combines LPing with novel option strategies to boost yield). I’ve also worked on mainnet projects such as jAura (an auto-compounded LSD for the Aura token).
While I don’t have specific experience with the grants program, I possess the expertise to assess a competent team, a promising project, and a groundbreaking idea. I look for individuals who are hungry in the crypto landfield, and driven to bring significant value in a manner that is sustainable. Execution is everything. Even a mediocre idea can evolve into a decent product with optimal execution, whereas a great idea, if poorly executed, will fail to benefit anyone.
What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you?
Based on my personal experience with JonesDao, I believe there’s much to explore about derivatives, especially options. With my background as a volatility trader, I’ve observed what could be seen as flaws in the current models. This is primarily due to the absence of essential data, such as IV, to plug into the models. This key fact, combined with the liquidity model which is inherent unique to crypto, presents untapped opportunities for derivatives. Options should be incorporated within other liquidity products rather than simply being considered as, for example, an addition to a position or an hedge. A novel model rooted in this concept could lead us tovastly improved liquidity efficiency, surpassing what’s currently possible in other financial markets, thanks to the technical capabilities of crypto. The total addressable market for a model like this would be huge.
Arbitrum, with its speed and minimal costs, is the ideal chain for the adoption of crypto derivatives. I’m very bullish about projects that prioritize and experiment with this primitive, and in general with derivatives. It’s no coincidence that both GMX and Dopex are native projects on Arbitrum.
A compelling grant proposal should articulate several key points. I’m not only interested in understanding the target audience for the product but also the implementation strategy, liquidity sourcing methods, current technical and design challenges, and the team’s approach to resolving them. Furthermore, the rationale behind choosing one model over another is crucial. A team that lives and breaths a product has to be able to justify every decision made, from brainstorming, design, to implementation.
Time commitment: I plan to commit as much time as it would be needed (so, in this case, at least 15h/week), and to have a low TAT of about 48h.
Declaration of Conflict of Interest: I currently work full time for JonesDao, and I contribute to Aura protocol, so I would recuse myself from any grant request or decision towards these DAO.

Events which combines social causes with crypto such as those being organised by  https://twitter.com/web3beach are a great way to get folks who need crypto the most, also get interested in the topic while creating social impact.
Education:
Online courses and tutorials, animated educational videos in many languages, coding bootcamps, certification programs and educational blogs and articles.
In my opinion a good proposal has 2 key elements
a. The proposer is able to provide proof of work, either from other sponsors or their own initiaitves.
b. Clear KPIs and milestones focused on reach, views and engagement

Time commitment - You need to commit at least 15 hours of your time per week as a domain allocator, and what is the expected Turn Around Time (TAT) that the builders can expect from you?

I am available to dedicate this time and TAT is 48 hours during weekdays.

Currently the CEO and Co-Founder of Alcancía. Be your own bank infrastructure for the 300M underbanked Latin Americans financially backed by Aave Grants DAO, Compound Grants Program, Celo Community Fund (Prezenti) and one of the biggest web3 investors in the space Outlier Ventures. Throughout my time developing self custodial wallets in Layer-2 infrastructure we have managed to be the only web3 based startup to make a partnership with Mexico’s biggest bank – Banco BBVA, and the only one in the world to integrate into the biggest remittance network (UniTeller) which provides money transfer services to giants like MoneyGram and Western Union.


Aside from my time as an entrepreneur, I also currently help the Worldcoin team launch and expand their operations in Mexico City being an orb operator and hosting more than one third of the country’s sign ups since the project’s launch. Have also been prized 2x from ETH Global Hackathons using Layer-2 infrastructure and WalletConnect in ReFi projects that use hard tech and blockchain to create a rewards system for beer recyclers.

What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you?

I’d like to first address some of the issues found in DevTooling and documentation throughout the experience of developing a dApp that reduces the learning curve to users:


Incompatibility with different frameworks and tools. Especially for mobile, most of the times most packages and documentation is not suited for devices that will bring the next 1B users.


Lack of documentation and tutorials: Self explanatory, but an example we had personally was that we are the only startup to crack and propose a fluent documentation for WalletConnect integration in Flutter. This led us to a win in ETH Global Mexico City.


Symbiosis between developer communities: DevRel should be considered a priority so that they can get the help and support when they need it.


Arbitrum in comparison to its optimistic rollup frenemy (Optimism) has some things going for it: lower gas fees using multi-round fraud proofs, faster transaction finality, a larger ecosystem and of course more decentralized due to its larger number of validators.
The priority through this domain allocator will be focused on NOVA’s capabilities of higher throughput, extensibility, and the security brought by an AnyTrust chain. As such a grant proposal in DevTooling should focus on contracts, documentation, and DevRel initiatives that promote high-scalability dApps such as but not only towards: Gaming, social dApps (who knows if we find a Lens alternative from this program, DeFi such as perps, derivatives and futures, and/or NFTs)
Proposals should cover the following (and from being a fellow user of Questbook it should be a standard for all Grant Programs to use the following format):


What are you building (less than 400 characters)


In which stage is the project currently at?


Where are you heading with this grant?


What are your metrics of success?


Why you?


Funding disbursement schedule (should look like this)




Time commitment: I can commit to more than the 15 hours a week, expect my turn around time of 48 hours with feedback or a follow-up call/interview so we can talk more about your product and proposal.


Declaration of Conflict of Interest: Alcancía will not be involved in any grant proposals, hence I will not involve any personal interests towards the Arbitrum DAO grants program.

Certainly, here’s a breakdown of what I would like to see built on Arbitrum in the Education, Community Growth, and Events domain, along with what constitutes a strong grant proposal:


A. Innovative Educational Platforms: I’m interested in grant proposals that focus on developing interactive and innovative educational platforms that leverage the scalability and efficiency of Arbitrum, offering accessible and engaging learning experiences for users.
B. Vibrant Community Initiatives: Strong grant proposals should outline community-building initiatives that foster engagement, knowledge-sharing, and collaboration among users and developers within the Arbitrum ecosystem, nurturing a vibrant and supportive community.
C. Impactful Events and Workshops: I’d like to see grant proposals that include plans for organizing impactful events, workshops, and webinars that educate, inspire, and bring together participants interested in exploring and utilizing Arbitrum’s capabilities.
D. Clear KPIs and Deliverables:A good grant proposal should articulate well-defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and deliverables, providing a clear roadmap for measuring the success and impact of the proposed project within the Education, Community Growth, and Events domain.
E. Ecosystem Growth Strategy: Strong proposals should present a well-thought-out strategy for driving ecosystem growth by attracting new users, developers, and stakeholders to participate in the Arbitrum network, thereby expanding its reach and impact.

What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you?
What we would like to see
As Arbitrum continues to improve blockchain scalability, it is important to continue to innovate on how we as a community can help bring more users, ideas, and liquidity, to Arbitrum. We would like to see experiments that help to align incentives between users, contributors, developers, and protocols. This will allow for a better experience for all members of the community and further the success of Arbitrum.
Some examples of experiments we think can improve Arbitrum are:

Initiatives that help align incentives either economically or socially for groups and organizations
Innovative on/off ramps and bridges to streamline user onboarding onto the Arbitrum network
Applications that improve user experience and attract web2 users
Initiatives that enhance the safety and efficiency of Arbitrum’s governance

What a good proposal looks like
We expect a successful grant application to demonstrate the following characteristics:
Clear milestones and timelines
It can sometimes be hard to know if a grantee is fulfilling their promises. This is why it is crucial to have clear milestones and timelines to assure the grantee is making progress and staying on track to complete the grant instead of running away with the money.
Granular explanations for the amount of funding requested
To prevent overspending by the DAO, it’s crucial to have a clear understanding of how the grant money will be allocated. Grant applications should have a detailed breakdown of their budgets including the number of contributors, anticipated hours of work, infrastructure costs, development costs, and any additional costs. This level of transparency will assure the DAO that the funds will be utilized effectively and for the intended purpose.
Consistent communication with the community
Grantees are encouraged to foster transparency within the community, sharing regular updates and soliciting feedback. This practice not only strengthens the bond between grantees and the community but also presents an invaluable opportunity for grantees to receive valuable insights from the DAO. Stay connected and informed!
Clear value-add to the ecosystem
Each grant application must clearly articulate the positive impact their project will have on the Arbitrum Ecosystem. This not only justifies their eligibility for DAO funds but also reflects their commitment to advancing the ecosystem’s growth and development.
Time commitment - You need to commit at least 15 hours of your time per week as a domain allocator, and what is the expected Turn Around Time (TAT) that the builders can expect from you?
We are fully committed to dedicating a minimum of 15 hours per week as a Domain Allocator. In the extremely unlikely event that @Matt_StableLab is unable to fulfill the required hours, our team of dedicated governance specialists at StableLab will step in to ensure the work gets done. We expect our TAT to be prompt and expect to get back to builders within 48 hours.

Gaming has been an integral part of my life, fueling my passion for innovation within the field. I’ve not only been an avid gamer for years but have also ventured into simple game development during my education and early years. While my initial projects were basic, they ignited my fascination with game theory and development.
I firmly believe that the next groundbreaking innovation in the crypto space, capable of onboarding millions, will emerge from gaming. I see tremendous potential in platforms like Arbitrum, Nova, and eventually Orbit to facilitate this evolution.

Do you have experience running in any other grant programs?

Although I haven’t directly been involved in managing grant programs, my past roles have equipped me with valuable skills. I’ve successfully led teams, handled budgets, and managed projects with efficiency. This meant collaborating with different groups and handling multiple tasks at once. My ability to lead teams and navigate complex projects puts me in a strong position to excel in similar situations.
Outside of this I am a “crypto native”, active on Arbitrum almost exclusively for the last 18 months.  I am involved in multiple dao’s and governance programs in various capacities - Sector finance, Jones dao, Camelot, and others.

What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you

Anything and everything - I want to see some novel off the wall mechanics that never occurred to me! I want arbitrum to be the place where new crazy game innovation takes place, developers should be excited to apply to build their dream game here and have the full support and encouragement of the foundation and the grants committee.  At the same time we shouldn’t forget the success that have already launched on this platform and existing success stories like Treasure DAO will find a partner in me to help them reach new levels.
A strong grant proposal should articulate a clear vision of the proposed project, demonstrating how it leverages Arbitrum’s strengths to deliver value to gamers. It should outline the technical details, including how the project utilizes Arbitrum’s scalability and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, the proposal should highlight the potential impact on user experience, innovation, and adoption within the gaming community.
A robust plan for development, testing, and deployment, along with a sustainable business model, will enhance the credibility of the proposal.
Overall, the proposal should showcase a deep understanding of both the gaming industry and Arbitrum’s capabilities, demonstrating how the project can elevate gaming experiences within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Time commitment - You need to commit at least 15 hours of your time per week as a domain allocator, and what is the expected Turn Around Time (TAT) that the builders can expect from you?

I’m absolutely capable of dedicating a minimum of 15 hours and up to 30 hours per week to this role.
I will consistently aim for the shortest possible turnaround time. I plan to establish outreach and continuous communication strategies to ensure that applicants are well-informed throughout every stage of the process. Personally, I believe time is of the essence, and we should be making every effort to expedite developer hours while also reducing inefficiencies and misallocations.
Applicants can expect a TAT of less than 48 hours in most cases.

Declaration of Conflict of Interest

I have financial stakes in various Arbitrum native protocols and projects. In the event that I encounter a grant proposal related to a project in which I hold a financial interest, I am committed to seeking guidance from the program administrator. If deemed necessary, I will recuse myself from participating in any decisions related to  said project.
Thankyou for your time and consideration for this position, I am excited to help builders as we endeavor together to make Arbitrum the most used and best level 2 (and 3) on Ethereum",12

Who we are
We are an investment and incubation company, and the domain allocator’s JD is exactly what we do. We have been reviewing and identifying projects using our in-house rubric since 2018. It all started very organically at the beginning and eventually our core members came together to establish IDEA2IDO Investing. One of our key ideators (TG handle @awnyrvan) has been an active advisor to Gains Network (one of the top 3 decentralized leverage trading platforms) since its inception. We are also a Harmony ‘foundation node’ investor.
We have been engaged with the crypto gaming industry on a personal as well as on a community-engagement level since 2021. We have been advisors for several gameFi projects - most recent one being a game named Bandzai (https://alpha.bandzai.games/), which is unique in the sense that it is fully on-chain and is on the way to becoming the first ever game to launch on a zkEVM platform.  In addition, we have developed our own virtual NFT rental platform (rentmynft.xyz) with a unique and original solution to the problem of automated on-chain scholar management and virtual in-game NFT rental for crypto games.
Interested Domain: Gaming
Experience:


We have advised a couple of Play2Earn games in 2021 with suggestions on game economics design, community building, connecting the games to the right ecosystem partners, and, in a few cases, helping them obtain grant funds. Most noteworthy was Mochi Market which developed a complete gameFi platform including a launchpad.


In 2022, we formed and ran the India chapter of an Axie Infinity guild, acquiring and managing scholars for our chapter.


We have developed a key middleware tech stack that enables virtual NFT rental for any NFT-based on-chain game that integrates our Solidity interface. We expect our technology for virtual NFT-renting to unlock significant adoption for games and gaming guilds. We are essentially well equipped to guide a game from an early stage to the stage of final deployment and adoption.


We are advising a fully on-chain game launched on Polygon zkEVM Network. This could be one of the first games to launch on this network and is expected to increase on-chain traffic of Polygon zkEVM significantly.



What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you

What we would like to see in Arbitrum’s gaming domain:

Increase in weekly active users: We would like to see game developers come up with games that will bring in more active weekly users to the Treasure ecosystem. Treasure’s ecosystem of interconnected metaverses, users, and assets is a pioneer in interoperability in Web3 gaming, and the system encourages gamers to explore different games. But even though Treasure has achieved remarkable milestones within 2 years of launch, overall, according to data from Dune Analytics, the weekly active users on the Treasure ecosystem seems to be on a decline.

Data from Dune Analytics show that games such as Knights of the Ether,
Realmverse, Toadstoolz, Battlefly, The Lost Donkeys, and The Beacon have all
recently seen declining weekly active users. Furthermore, even though
Bridgeworld and Smolverse were and still are the most popular games in
Treasure, they seem to be following the same trend of decline in weekly active
users.
It would be good to analyze the root cause of this decline and deploy a course correction. There also seem to be several low-traction games in Treasure, which might be weeded out to keep the metaverse consistently exciting to gamers. The Treasure ecosystem deserves to be nurtured, and exciting games need to be courted, acquired, and plugged in.


Increase in weekly new users: We would like to see new users embracing the ecosystem and becoming active new users. Data from Dune Analytics indicate a fall in weekly new users for several games, including Realmverse, Toadstoolz, Battlefly, The Lost Donkeys, and The Beacon. The popular games Bridgeworld and Smolverse do not escape this trend.


A focus on Xai Network: I would like to see game developers proposing to build games on Arbitrum’s soon-to-be-launched gaming-focused Xai Network to give their end users a smoother and more frictionless gaming experience with the relatively cheaper and faster transactions that will come with this Layer 3 network. If Xai can provide a more seamless and uninterrupted experience than is currently available to gamers, it could mean a leap for the gaming industry.


Requirements of a good grant proposal:
A grant proposal should outline the main idea behind the project, explain why the organization needs fund money, and demonstrate the need and worthiness of the project. It should include the following information:

vision, mission, goals, and objectives
how the grant funds, if granted, will be used
a timeline for completion of the project
expected results
value and impact of the proposed project, if any


Time commitment and turn-around time:

We can commit to 15 hours per week, and our turn-around time will be 48 hours.

Declaration of Conflict of Interest:

We are currently involved with a game named Bandzai. Idea2ido will recuse itself from the grant application process of Bandzai, if it comes to that.
We hope to bring our years of crypto ecosystem experience if selected as domain allocator. Even, otherwise, we are always happy to help and engage and take the Arbitrum ecosystem forward.",13

What is your experience in the interested domain? I am applying for the Gaming Domain. I’ve done a fair amount of gaming in my personal life, as well as tried out projects here and there in the space as the opportunities arose. I think there is potential for gaming to merge with blockchain technology, and Arbitrium’s low fees is something that I think can start to make it more economically feasible as the technology matures. I think I can bring a good balance of perspective when it comes to what makes a successful gaming product that also works well within the benefits and limitations of blockchain technology.
Please share links and supporting information. Do you have experience running in any other grant programs? This would be my first role within a grants committee. I have been participating in and following the crypto space since late 2015. While I don’t have a much technical developer knowledge, I feel I make up for that with my broad blockchain knowledge and general experiences over that time. Included with that is having seen a ton of the projects that have succeeded and failed in the last decade or so and I hope to use what I’ve observed of those events to help projects grow within this grant system. I have dabbled in educational projects as they arose (ETH Merge Write-Ups & Decentralization Education Projects to name a few). This year I expanded my roles in this space by taking on a role as a HOP & ARB delegate, and as a multi-sig signer for the EVMavericks DAO. Through those projects I’ve learned what it takes to make projects work within a decentralized, internet based team.
What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you? First, I want to say that I am open to any and all ideas. My goal is not to filter projects into defined boxes, but to give projects a platform to grow their vision. I think the over-arching goals would be to both expand legacy gaming projects into the Arbitrum space, as well as create a place for starter projects to thrive. I’d like to see Blockchain gaming really take that next step into mainstream usage. I think even beyond strictly game building itself, I’d like to see projects that work with legacy media to enhance that experience, things like preservation of media come to mind.
A good grant proposal should include:

A high-level summary of what is being built
Clear and structured roadmap on how to achieve the goals of the project
Describe how the project will benefit the Arbitrum / Ethereum / Blockchain space. In that same vein, how this grant can help your project succeed
Detailed and transparent breakdown of budget, hours, expected cost.
A plus would be a some backstory on the project and why you chose to pursue it!

Time commitment: I can commit to the 15 hours as required by the Domain Allocator role, and look to have a TAT of about 48h.
Declaration of Conflict of Interest: I am a delegate in the HOP and ARB DAOs. I also worked with Saurabh on the Snapshot / Tally voting. Since I am running for a Domain Allocator position, I plan to vote abstain when this vote goes to Snapshot to avoid any conflict of interest.",14

As the central hub for the latest DeFi innovations, the Arbitrum ecosystem is full of builders with the objective of gaining real user adoption, offering streamlined on-chain user experiences and eventually increasing the user base of decentralized products.
Personally, a good proposal needs to meet the following criteria：

The proposals need to aim at boosting in-ecosystem user activities and/or onboarding more users into the Arbitrum ecosystem in various domains, including DeFi, Gaming, Infrastructures and more.
The proposal must contain feasible goals, detailed cost estimation, a well-described execution plan and a clear KPI for the estimated results.

LayerX
LayerX is a builder hub that connects developers and organizations through hackathons and bounties.
Our mission is to leverage the power of web3 to revolutionize the way we interact with the world, reshaping the future of work. Currently, we have three main pillars: Bepro Network is a web3 protocol for software development bounties, which allows organizations to offer rewards for developing specific projects or features. TAIKAI is a web3 platform developed specifically for hosting hackathons. It’s designed to make it easy for organizations to run online hackathons and to help developers connect with each other and with potential employers or clients. And dappKit is a powerful open-source SDK that allows you to develop beautiful web3 apps.
By combining these three products, we strive to empower developers, organizations, and individuals alike, unlocking new ways to interact and work.
Regarding hackathons, we have supported numerous community events and hosted a relevant number of challenges. Also, we have collaborated closely with Latin-american ETH events, like ETH Samba, EthereumSP, ETH Argentina, besides ETH events in other continents, like ETH Belgrade, ETH Taipei, ETH Safari and more.

5- What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you?
Specifically, we are eager to see projects built on Arbitrum that drive widespread adoption of Layer 2 technologies in the educational sector, providing a smoother and more accessible user experience for all participants. We aim to witness the rise of decentralized educational apps that bring forward innovative solutions for the certification and validation of academic achievements, thus simplifying the accreditation and acknowledgment of skills acquired within the Layer 2 ecosystem.
Furthermore, we are excited about platforms and protocols on Arbitrum that champion peer-to-peer collaboration and learning, promoting the establishment of robust and enriching educational communities.
Therefore, a compelling grant proposal for us would address the following aspects, listed in order of priority:

Organizing Hackathons: We are keen on grant proposals focusing on the organization of web3 hackathon events centered around the Arbitrum ecosystems. We believe it’s vital for devs and project builders to take their initial steps in Arbitrum; we need to expand use cases and outreach to the developer community.
Institutional Community Growth Initiatives: We’re looking for proposals aiming to expand and strengthen the Arbitrum community through endeavors like targeted outreach programs at universities and educational institutions. We find this crucial to bring Arbitrum closer to the academic realm.
Educational Content and Workshops: We are interested in backing proposals that create comprehensive and accessible educational resources on Arbitrum. Especially timeless content for devs, such as tutorials on Arbitrum development, and explanatory videos on the workings of Arbitrum One, Nova, Orbit, and BOLD. This material should be public and free. We are keen on multi-language content. Note: Regarding educational aspects, we won’t support sensationalist content, topics about airdrops, ARB token prices, or news. We aim for enduring and constructive educational content.

Considerations
A robust grant proposal should outline clear objectives, measurable outcomes, and a sustainability plan beyond the grant period. We commit to supporting projects with a lasting positive impact on the community and the overall Arbitrum ecosystem.
6- Time commitment - You need to commit at least 15 hours of your time per week as a domain allocator, and what is the expected Turn Around Time (TAT) that the builders can expect from you?
As detailed earlier, we will make available to this domain the teams from SEED Latam, L2 en Español, and LayerX, totaling 11 people. This allows us, if necessary, to provide over 15 hours weekly and cover various time slots.
Supported by the above, a broad team enables us to offer rapid assistance and also quick responses to queries and requests. We also strive to maintain efficient communication and keep proposers informed of any potential delays, so they can plan accordingly.
7- Declaration of Conflict of Interest
SEED Latam, L2 en Español, and LayerX are large ecosystems with many contributors involved directly or indirectly with projects, protocols, and communities. If any applicant is directly or indirectly associated with SEED Latam, L2 en Epañol, or LayerX, we will make a public announcement to inform the community, ensuring they are aware of the matter.",16
15759,Flook,2023-08-21 00:14:48,"Greetings fellow Arbinauts, Adam here.
I’m nominating myself for the position of Gaming Domain Allocator.
1. Name: Adam
2. Forum Username: Flook
3. Twitter: https://twitter.com/Flook_eth
4. Experience
I come from a long background of gaming. It’s been my main passion and hobby since I was old enough to hold a controller. I’ve been in the Ethereum ecosystem since late 2017 and I’ve been building games in the web3 gaming space since September, 2021 (on Arbitrum One since March, 2022).
I’m the Co-founder and CEO of Merlyn Labs, the gaming studio responsible for the Knights of the Ether: Blightfell and Squires games.
I’ve lived and breathed web3 gaming, game design, and the gaming industry for the past 2 years. I’m extremely clear-sighted when it comes to what makes web3 gaming unique, as well as what green and red flags can be found in early to mid-stage web3 gaming projects. At Merlyn Labs we’ve surmounted a lot of obstacles related to design, development, contractors, partnerships, economy, bridging to Arbitrum, and so much more. This leaves me very well suited to spotting and anticipating these issues for other Arbitrum gaming builders.
I’ve been featured on over a dozen spaces and multiple podcasts speaking specifically about web3 gaming. You can find the most recent podcast here: Spotify
I’m also slated to speak at NFT Fest Lugano this September on a web3 gaming panel. You can find me on the list of speakers on their website. (I’d be happy to share more links, but I’m currently limited to 2 links per post).
Over the last 2 years since creating the web3 gaming studio Merlyn Labs, I’ve worked in partnership with major gaming art studios such as Volta and Liquid Animations, who are responsible for Halo 5, New World, For Honor, Borderlands 3, and many more.
I’ve also worked in partnership with dozens of game developers, game designers, sound effects engineers and Solidity engineers in the blockchain gaming space who have worked on projects as well known as Atari and Goblintown, as well as multiple Treasure ecosystem games.
Additionally, our studio has been a partner and game builder in the Treasure ecosystem since April 2022, when we initially launched our Squires game on Arbitrum.
As one of the very few web3 game founders who has been building and growing in parallel with the Arbitrum chain for over seventeen months now, I believe I’m uniquely suited to helping foster the expansion of gaming and its culture on both Arbitrum One and Nova. I truly care about the ecosystem and I’m very motivated to help grow gaming on Arbitrum to realize its full potential.
I know what good work looks like and I know what level of organization and execution it takes to deliver on not just a traditional game, but the promise of a web3 game with unique meta-mechanics and economics derived from blockchain integration. After almost two years of working nonstop on an innovative web3 gaming ecosystem, to much success so far, I’m confident I can detect which traits a game in this space would need to be successful.
While I don’t have specific experience in running grant programs, I’m positive I’ll get up to speed quickly and deliver great results on behalf of the Arbitrum community.
5. Vision
Arbitrum will be the home of Indie gaming. Let’s avoid using incentive programs to fund high-risk and high-cost AAA gaming initiatives. Instead of trying to compete in that arena, let’s build our own.
By focusing on passionate indie developers and talented indie studios, we can foster a tight-knit, interoperable ecosystem of unique, innovative, and fun games that attract gaming enthusiasts from all walks of life.
There should be a strong focus around utilizing blockchain in new and interesting ways that brings both ease of trading and intrinsic value to a game’s economy, as well as value centered around community participation, on-chain profiles and achievements, mutable evolution of characters and items, verifiable randomness, and the many other benefits blockchains can bring to games.
I personally have a great grasp on where and how blockchain can be implemented in games in ways that enhance the user experience without throwing up obstacles to user acquisition such as wallet integrations and cryptocurrency purchases. I’d like to see more games built with blockchain in the background, less obvious to the average user.
Alternatively, there is undoubtedly a space for on-chain gaming and games that forefront their blockchain technology. They both serve different niches and can co-exist in the wider Arbitrum gaming ecosystem. I’m looking forward to reading proposals from all sorts of games and gaming products.
As the domain allocator I’ll remain both open-minded to all types of gaming proposals, while also pushing back (and outright rejecting) where needed if I notice gaps in the armor.
Finally, I’d also like to see multiple games create joint proposals together that fund meaningful interoperability between themselves, as a way to prove the concept even further that interoperability can be a driving force of differentiation between web2 and web3.
As for quality grant proposals I’d like to see several key attributes:
Context: I’ll need background on each of the moving pieces to fully consider any proposal. Tell me all about:

The team
The game or product
The vision
The KPI’s and Milestones coming up
The journey so far

Content: The 5 W’s.

Who is getting paid from the grant?
When can we expect completion?
Where are the funds being put to use?
What structure or pre-requisites are in place to ensure the KPI’s are met?
Why Arbitrum? Why your game or product? Why this grant program?

Challenges: What might get in your way?

Where are the foreseen obstacles and how do you expect to surmount them?
Does this grant give you a meaningful and measurable leg up in that process?
How have you overcome previous obstacles to reach the current stage of your project?

6. Time Commitment
I will happily spend the full 15 hours per week as a domain allocator. Builders can expect a <24 hour TAT during weekdays and <48 hours during most weekends. I’ll also make sure to respond to any builder’s messages before 5pm PST on Fridays so as to ensure the builders can spend the weekend making any necessary revisions.
7. Declaration of Conflict of Interest
I do have two conflicts of interest that I’d like to declare.
I’m in charge of another gaming project on Arbitrum, Knights of the Ether, and I’m also a core game partner at Treasure. Obviously no grant money from this program will go towards Knights of the Ether for as long as I am the domain allocator, that should go without saying. As for other Treasure projects that may apply for funding, I will be ultra transparent with my decision-making process and I will make sure to loop in the project manager more closely to ensure that every builder that applies receives an equal opportunity for funding.
I’m a firm believer that there is no need for a competitive mindset between games or gaming ecosystems on Arbitrum. Instead of quarreling over the small audience we all currently share, we should be building in concert, arms linked, for the next 1, 2, 5, 10 years and beyond of gaming on Arbitrum in order to help grow the pie for all of us.
I’d be honored to help steward that expansion, even if only for the next 6 months.
Thank you for your consideration.",17

15759,raj,2023-08-21 08:07:46,"I would like to nominate myself for the domain of “Education, Community Growth and Events”.
Name: Raj Karia
Your forum username: @raj
Twitter: twitter.com/rajkaria_
What is your experience in the interested domain? Please share links and supporting information.
I’ve been building truts.xyz which is a platform where you can discover web3 projects and we have a suite of tools that help with community engagement and loyalty. This helps me understand the problems community and ecosystem face on a day-to-day basis.
Before that, I was contributing and got involved with many communities/projects like BanklessDAO, Forefront, Aave, Compound, Aurora, and more in a personal capacity and was an active and passive contributor there. I have contributed to and explored almost 250+ web3 projects. I’ve learned a lot, so now I can quickly see what works and what doesn’t when it comes to growing a community.
I also created “academy.truts.xyz”, where people can find resources about different chains, defi projects, infra, technologies, and many more. I once taught Solidity to 100 developers in a close cohort and even spoke about blockchain at some universities in India. I’ve been a part of starting up 15+ blockchain clubs too. The above experiences would help me navigate through the proposals in the education sector and figure out what’s best for the ecosystem.
Do you have experience running in any other grant programs?
Yeah, I’ve been around the block with grants. I helped out with Polygon Grants in India. I also took a look at how other folks like Harmony, Near, Aurora, Aave, Solana, Polygon, Filecoin, Polkadot, Cardano were doing their grants to understand the ecosystem better and later offered help to few of these ecosystems.
My project, truts.xyz, even got some grants from places like Polygon, NEAR, and Filecoin, AAVE, Mantle (announcement for these are not done on social media). I have also helped multiple other friends in the ecosystem to draft their grant proposals for different chains and grant programs.
The edge I have is that I’ve seen grants from both sides – applying for them and approving them. It helps me really understand what makes a grant good or bad for the community/ecosystem. I think that experience could be really handy.
What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain
I envision a thriving and interconnected ecosystem on Arbitrum that not only cultivates technological innovation but fosters a vibrant community and enhances education. Here’s how I picture it:
Education:

Developer Onboarding: A comprehensive library of engaging videos, content, and tutorials designed to welcome and support developers at all levels.
Global Awareness Workshops: Regular, hands-on workshops in various locations worldwide, demystifying Arbitrum and spreading awareness of its capabilities.
Hackathons: Encouraging and facilitating both participation and organization of hackathons to ignite creativity and collaboration.
Mentorship and Developer Relations: Targeted programs to cultivate a network of mentors and developer advocates who can passionately convey the potential of Arbitrum.
Problem-Solving Initiatives: Specific Requests for Proposals (RFPs) focusing on real-world problems that can be innovatively solved using Arbitrum, driving targeted development.

Community:

Interconnected Ecosystem: Creating synergies between different apps in the ecosystem, allowing for seamless interaction and collaboration.
Retention Strategies: Implementing initiatives that celebrate community participation and loyalty, ensuring a dynamic and engaged ecosystem.
Collaboration Enhancements: Developing tools and activities that facilitate collaboration, fostering a sense of belonging and collective purpose.
Community Opportunities: Encouraging Dapps in the ecosystem to provide meaningful opportunities for community members to contribute and grow.

Events:

Hackathon and Conference Presence: Building a robust presence at key developer hackathons and conferences, offering side-events that showcase Arbitrum’s strengths.
University Outreach: Expanding educational reach by conducting university workshops, tailored to onboard the next generation of developers and advocates for Arbitrum.

What a good grant proposal looks like for you
A proposal that consist of all the below items and in a well described manner which is specific for the problem they are hoping to solve and arbitrum ecosystem would be a good grant proposal according to me.

Funding Request: The amount being requested and a high-level summary of how the funds will be used.
Title: A concise name for the project.
Overview: Brief description, alignment with Arbitrum’s mission, and funding request.
Problem Statement: The issue to be addressed with details and statistics if possible.
Team’s Background: Relevant information about the team members.
Goals: Clear and specific goals that are aligned with the Arbitrum’s focus areas.
Audience & Innovation: Target beneficiaries, innovative aspects and how the project will impact Arbitrum ecosystem
Approach & Timeline: Detailed strategy and realistic and well-thought-out project timeline, with milestones.
Collaborations: Any relevant partnerships.
Breakdown & Justification: Detailed budget and explanations for each item.
Measurement & Sustainability: Criteria for success, sustainability plans, KPIs
Impact: Explanation of how the project will contribute to social good, community development, or other relevant benefits.
Risks & Mitigation: Identification and plans to address potential risks.
Past Successes: Evidence of previous successful projects, if available.

Time commitment - You need to commit at least 15 hours of your time per week as a domain allocator, and what is the expected Turn Around Time (TAT) that the builders can expect from you?
Absolutely! I can commit to 15 hours a week or even more if needed. But it’s not just about the time; it’s about quality interactions too. Whether I accept or reject a proposal, I’ll provide thoughtful and constructive feedback. I believe that feedback can be a valuable learning experience, and I’m committed to helping builders understand my decisions. And when it comes to responsiveness, I promise a maximum Turn Around Time of 48 hours regardless of whether it is a weekday or a weekend. Time is precious, and I’ll be there to support the project every step of the way.
Declaration of Conflict of Interest
I don’t have any conflict of Interest as of now. Since what I am building is a discovery platform there’s a probability that projects applying for arbitrum grants might be listed on our platform but I will make sure to evaluate them without any particular interest. If in the future, there exists a conflict or a case of personal interest, I will talk with the program manager and stay out of that decision and notify everyone in the community the same.",19

15759,mcfly,2023-08-23 14:21:48,"Hey folks,
I’m McFly, tossing my cap in the ring to become a domain allocator for the “New Protocol Ideas” domain.
You might recognize me from forums as mcfly or on Twitter as @0xmcflyeth.
Been diving into Web3 and DeFi since 2017, core contributor on projects like Bunni.pro Timelessfi.com, and 88mph.app. Throughout these contributions, I’ve nurtured a network of skilled development teams, continuously seeking avenues to develop innovative solutions together. Before this, I was all about UX and product development for online shopping and fintech platforms. If you’re curious, peek at my GitHub here.
Ever dealt with grants?
Yup, dabbled with 88mph.foundation and helped some newcomers in the space.
Arbitrum…what’s the plan?
I think we need to go beyond the same ol’ financial products. We gotta build stuff that speaks to everyone - like my mom, for instance. Let’s make crypto less cryptic for the average Joe. Sure, I’m all in for innovative DeFi stuff, but looking at the Arbitrum scene, maybe we’re already heavy on AMMs, Perps, and Lending?
Grant proposals? I’d love to see:

Open-source stuff.
Clear ideas.
Timeline and budget.
KYC checks. Just to keep things on the up and up.

Time? I can easily do 15 hours a week. Reach out, and I’ll get back within 72 hours.
Lastly, full disclosure: I’m working with Timeless and Bunni, and I’m an Arbitrum Delegate. I’ll step back if there’s any conflict of interest.
Cheers! Can’t wait to dive in deeper with Arbitrum.",25

Greetings from Blocktools!
Some quick info on us for those who may be unaware!


Name: JB


Your forum username: Blocktools


Twitter: BlocktoolBox


What is your experience in the interested domain? Please share links and supporting information.


Past multi-chain protocol development experience aside, I currently lead the Program Management at Blocktools that includes

Community learn2earn initiaitive where we equip regular users in Web3 with free to use tools and give them a mentored environment inclusive of Tech sessions, unlimited Faucet ETH, multiple kickstarter templates to get started and funding where applicable.

More info at BlockTools – Medium and blocktoolbox | Twitter | Linktree


Manage what is likely the only pay-as-you-go Web3 shopping mall today, equipped with multi chain, fully functional Web3 merchandize ranging from Liquidity Lockers and Snipers to DAOs and Staking Pools.


Lead a community of 300+ enthusiasts who are part of our various builds ground up!


All of the above in the end materializes into the Blocktools Grants program where we try to identify unique ideas that have germinated from the open workshop and see what we can do to help them along! We have a liquifier protocol that easily manages the tax redistribution for protocol expenses that allows for easy administration and on-chain transparency! Selected projects get to feature on the Blocktools Launchpad.


Our core target audience is a user who has never written a line of code before!
Do you have experience running in any other grant programs? Yes, and currently managing the same at Blocktools.

What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you

We would love to see cross-chain synergies that stretch beyond the current silos and see L2s relaying useful information a lot quicker and seamlessly while providing a more engaged and immersive experience for the user. We happen to be attempting this ourselves in a small way.
A good proposal for us will encompass:

what is being attempted
how will that attempt positively impact Arbitrum, Arbinauts and Crypto at large
how scalable is the idea with an eye on longevity
Can it be explained to someone on the outside in 3-4 simple lines


Time commitment - You need to commit at least 15 hours of your time per week as a domain allocator**, and what is the expected Turn Around Time (TAT) that the builders can expect from you?

As Web3 builders we are always online pushing the envelope and would love to help out others. Expected TAT ranges from 30-60-90 minutes within operating hours of 7am UTC to 10pm UTC give or take, beyond which responses might be delayed while we build-sleep-repeat

Declaration of Conflict of Interest: None that we can think of other than we have our own small grants program that is at a nascent stage targetting microcap ideas from the ground up, our audience is users who have never written a line of code before, our work involves significant amount of hand-holding and mentorship as it is more personalized respective to each workshop participant.

We wish all the participants here all the very best and hope to see some visionaries come forth! LFG!",28
15759,marc_blockshard,2023-08-25 19:16:38,"Hello everyone,
I’m excited to put forth my nomination for the “New Protocol Ideas” domain.

Name: Marc
Your forum username: @marc_blockshard
Twitter: @BumpyTale
What is your experience in the interested domain? Please share links and supporting information. Do you have experience running in any other grant programs?

I’m the CEO and co-founder of Blockshard, an infrastructure provider in the blockchain space. I’ve been working in crypto since 2018, since 2021 full time. My professional role has allowed me to collaborate closely with various blockchain teams, assisting them in testing their protocols. Through this, I’ve been able to provide valuable feedback and insights, aiding them in refining and strengthening their products.
Beyond my crypto involvement, I possess a rich background spanning over a decade in grant proposal writing and fundraising. This was a pivotal aspect of my responsibilities in my previous non-crypto career. Over the years, I’ve crafted and contributed to over 100 proposals, ranging from modest amounts to multi-million USD figures. This extensive experience has endowed me with a profound understanding of the intricacies of the grant process.
Furthermore, I currently serve on the grants committee of the SSV DAO, where I’m evaluating proposals from teams building on the SSV protocol, and guiding successful grantees through the project’s building cycle until its completion.
My dual experience, both in crafting and evaluating grant proposals, equips me with a unique vantage point. I understand the nuances of what constitutes a compelling proposal and the practicalities of executing it successfully.

What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you?

My aim is to support teams that use Arbitrum’s capabilities in innovative ways. The nature of the idea is secondary. The primary criteria for me are its novelty and originality. I am on the lookout for concepts that not only showcase creativity but also have the potential to drive user growth, usage and liquidity to Arbitrum. Importantly, I maintain a broad perspective, ensuring I don’t fixate on any one particular concept and remain unbiased and open to novel ideas that might be unprecedented in the space.
A standout grant proposal, in my view, is marked by its clarity and precision. It’s articulately written, succinctly presenting the core idea. The background of key team members should be detailed, showcasing their expertise and assuring their capability to execute the project. The proposal must convincingly demonstrate the product’s market fit and its unique edge. A clear go-to-market strategy is vital, indicating the project’s potential for traction post-launch. Milestones should be measurable for transparent progress assessment, with realistic timelines and a well-justified budget that aligns with the RFP’s scope. In essence, it’s about blending a compelling idea with viability, team capability, and tangible impact potential.

Time commitment - You need to commit at least 15 hours of your time per week as a domain allocator, and what is the expected Turn Around Time (TAT) that the builders can expect from you?

I am prepared to dedicate a minimum of 15 hours weekly as a domain allocator, with the flexibility to extend my availability during particularly demanding weeks. Builders can anticipate a TAT of 48 hours from me.

What is your experience in the interested domain?

I have quite a bit of experience in building & scaling crypto communities as well as working with grant programs, with a specialized focus in web3 grants.
Since 2020, I have been working with various crypto organizations, pioneering community building and growth in web3. Those organizations include: Olympus DAO, Klima DAO, Spice Finance, & Jones DAO. I have served in a lead marketing role for 3 of those organizations; Olympus, Spice, and Jones.
Within each org, I have helped develop & grow communities with memberships numbering in the 10’s of thousands. Through my help, each of these protocols reached new levels of success, TVL, and engagement.
Likewise, I have experience working with Grant programs. I was an early contributor and advisor to both the Olympus Grants & Olympus Incubator programs during my role as Marketing Lead at Olympus. Some of the projects I advised on ended up becoming prominent Arbitrum protocols such as Vesta & Jones DAO, the latter of which I am now a lead contributor of.
Here are some links to those programs:

Olympus Grants: OIP-55 - Olympus Grants Program - OlympusDAOForum
Olympus Incubator: OIP-41 - Launch Olympus Incubator program - OlympusDAOForum


What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you?

Speaking from experience as someone who runs communities & events in the Arbitrum space, there are a few specific things I myself would love to see built.
Examples of proposals I would be excited to see:

Event management tools for Discord / Telegram / X
Guild-style quest tools that disincentivize bot behavior and incentivize real engagement
An Arbitrum-Wiki listing all prominent projects and their use cases. Updated regularly.
Cross-community collaboration tools
Social alignment tools / Referral links made simple

That being said, I am open to many new ideas and hope to see things that I may not have considered to begin with. I am happy to be surprised.
A good grant proposal should present a unique idea that will change the way people interact with Arbitrum in a practical way. A good grant proposal should NOT be a fork of another protocol or a small iteration of a previously existing project.

Time commitment:

There is no issue with the 15 hour time commitment. If a project requires more time for consideration, I will be flexible catering to that need.

Declaration of Conflict of Interest:

If any grant proposals for Jones DAO were to come about, I would be fine abstaining from that decision making process.",30

Joined my first DAO in 2020 and in 2021 I’ve joined GitcoinDAO as a grant reviewer in the FDD, then grew into the Grant Eligibility role. I’ve been responsible for reviewing and approving 95% of the grants between GR12-GR15.
My work with Gitcoin DAO(it’s all grant related  ) :

Lead the GE team for three seasons (Gitcoin rounds) and ensured the accurate review of 3000 grants applications all while minimizing fraud in Gitcoin rounds
Maintaining the grant approval time under 48 hours during the rounds
Managed a remote and decentralized team of reviewers and experimented towards a permissionless review narrative.
Recruited, trained reviewers and helped open up the review role to the whole Gitcoin community
Responsible for cross workstream coordination with all the WS involved in running the Gitcoin crowdfunding rounds all in a extremely dynamic environment
Introduced dynamic fraud investigations which saved over 1M$ in four seasons(GRs)
Identified and investigated over 1000 fraudulent grants and protected grant creators/donors/matching pool donors and the Gitcoin community from malicious activities
Co-authored some of the internal/external documents as well as processes involving eligibility

Yes, I have experience in running other grant programs. My work in Gitcoin also involved strategic planning around the grant processes.

5. What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you
Personally I would like to see more moonshot protocol ideas(similar to what Uniswap was in the beginning). If only one protocol idea manages to have that impact, Arbitrum will surely thrive as an ecosystem.
What a good proposal looks like
Imo a grant application should ideally have:


Direct and measurable impact in Arbitrums ecosystem


A degree of reputation in web3 (nothing fancy, but it either the contributors have earned trust in web3)


Detailed milestones(the grant should include a detailed explanation on how the funds are going to be used)


Full transparency(the grant application should allow us to see what they are building, spending, etc)


A degree of experimentation(Web3 wouldn’t have evolved to what it is today if the same protocols are just copied and rebuild on other L2s or ecosystems, so I would personally like to see more innovative grants participate)


6. Time commitment You need to commit at least 15 hours of your time per week as a domain allocator**, and what is the expected Turn Around Time (TAT) that the builders can expect from you?

Developer Tooling on NOVA
My name is Hiko (also known as Oki). I have been actively investing in crypto since 2016 and also working fulltime in the DeFi space since 2020. After my studies in Artificial Intelligence at university I dived into the growth hacking scene in DeFi and helped raise liquidity for dozens of projects. My journey eventually lead me to co-found a project (my second startup adventure up to this point) filling a 7-figure presale in less than 10 seconds. Having a background in both programming and marketing I have been naturally positioned to take on the product role.
It is at this position, when I realized how difficult it can be for founders to find solutions on which to build scalable, affordable and fast applications and how essential tools can be in this process. These complexities are hampering widescale innovation and adoption.
Arbitrum Nova is full of potential, promising a fraction of the transaction cost on Ethereum, without compromising on speed or security. While potential has been and continues to be great, adoption sadly hasn’t. TVL has been stable, since it’s launch and some initiative must be taken to get new projects to build on Arbitrum Nova.
5. What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you?
Some examples I’d like to see on Arbitrum Nova are the following:

Alchemy RPC on Arbitrum Nova
Debugging/testing tools

Good proposal framework would include at least the following:
Project Description: Clearly outline the purpose and goals of your project. Explain why your project is important and how it will contribute to the ecosystem built on Arbitrum Nova?
Technical Details: Provide a detailed technical overview of your project. Explain the architecture, design, and technologies you plan to use. Highlight how your project leverages the features and benefits of Arbitrum Nova
Scope and Milestones: Break down your project into achievable milestones. Each milestone should have specific deliverables and a timeline for completion. This demonstrates that you have a well-thought-out plan for development.
Team and Expertise: Introduce the members of your team and their relevant expertise. Highlight any previous projects, contributions, or experience that showcase your team’s capability to execute the proposed project.
Budget and Funding: Clearly state the funding you’re requesting and how you intend to allocate it. Break down the budget to show how funds will be used for development, testing, marketing, and any other relevant expenses.
Impact and Use Cases: Explain the potential impact of your project on the Arbitrum ecosystem and the broader blockchain space. Discuss potential use cases and how your project addresses existing challenges.
Sustainability: Outline your plans for maintaining and evolving the project beyond the grant period. This could include revenue models, tokenomics (if applicable), and strategies for attracting users and contributors.
Risks and Mitigations: Identify potential risks or challenges that your project might face and provide strategies to mitigate them. This shows that you’ve considered potential roadblocks and are prepared to handle them.
Community Engagement/Social Proof: Highlight your plans for engaging with the community, seeking feedback, and incorporating user input into your project’s development.

Time commitment - You need to commit at least 15 hours of your time per week as a domain allocator, and what is the expected Turn Around Time (TAT) that the builders can expect from you?

I can plan and commit at least 15 hours and a maximum of 20 hours for the tasks related to the position of domain allocator.
TAT of 24 hours during the week and 48 hours during the weekend should suffice.

What is your experience in the interested domain? Please share links and supporting information. Do you have experience running in any other grant programs?
Experience in interested domain :


DeFi experience : Currently, I am part of the Stella Strategy and BD team. Stella is a leveraged strategy protocol with 0% cost to borrow on Arbitrum. Stella was previously Alpha Homora, the first leveraged yield farming protocol with all time high TVL of $1.9B. My experience at Stella gives me good background in DeFi protocols, especially in the space of yield protocols, money markets, leverage staking, LPing etc.


Grant experience (Venture Capital) : I have previously worked in the grants/venture business, with Flipkart’s corporate venture capital arm. Was responsible for Flipkart Leap - where we disbursed 200k in grants across 8 startups in the ecommerce space. Set up and launched the program from scratch.


NFT experience : I was part of the Flipkart Labs team, which is the web3 arm of Flipkart - the biggest Indian ecommerce brand with 100M+ annual users. As part of the team, I was involved in launching Firedrops, the NFT marketplace for Flipkart with utility tied to loyalty programs and whitelisting for limited edition products. We managed to work around a lot of regulation and onboard 500k+ KYC’ed users onto our wallet (and platform). Left it to get out of the CeDeFi system and get into proper DeFi.


Infrastructure experience : I have previously worked in growth for Leap Wallet, the wallet for Cosmos ecosystem.


What would you like to see built on Arbitrum in your domain and what a good grant proposal looks like for you.
First part of the question - What do you want to see on Arbitrum
My thesis is that Arbitrum is going to face a lot of competition by well capitalized L2s in the coming months, with both Mantle and Base building their core competencies within DeFi.
Would personally want to see innovative protocols around the following themes to make Arbitrum stand out :

LSDfi protocols capitalizing on LSD influx onto L2s.
RWA protocols : Innovative protocols to attract the RWA on-chain with trust minimized mechanisms.
Derivative protocols : Building upon the perp DEX success of Arbitrum into options protocols.
LeverageFi protocols : Building capital efficient and risk adjusted Leverage layers for DeFi.

Second part of the question - What does a good grant proposal looks like for you.
A compelling grant proposal should articulate several key points. I’m not only interested in understanding the target audience for the product but also the implementation strategy, liquidity sourcing methods, current technical and design challenges, and the team’s approach to resolving them. Furthermore, the rationale behind choosing one model over another is crucial. A team that lives and breaths a product has to be able to justify every decision made, from brainstorming, design, to implementation.
I see a compelling grant proposal from two lenses :


How solid is the product and the strategy. This would cover :
a. What are the protocol mechanisms and how is it unique?
b. What is the GTM strategy? Liquidity Sourcing? Tailwinds expected?
c. Expected challenges and tactics to overcome them.


How well is the proposal articulated. This would cover :
a. Does the proposal have a detailed timeline with reasonable milestones?
b. Plans to keep the community updated about the progress of the project.
c. Plans in case the team decides to halt protocol development due to any unforeseen issues.


Time commitment - You need to commit at least 15 hours of your time per week as a domain allocator, and what is the expected Turn Around Time (TAT) that the builders can expect from you?
I can commit to at least 15 hours per week as a domain allocator, and am flexible to offer more if needed. Since I am perpetually online, the TAT that builders can expect from me is a maximum of 24 hours.
Declaration of Conflict of Interest : I am part of the Strategy and BD team at Stella - a native Arbitrum DeFi protocol.

Stella is already backed by top VCs like Binance Labs, Multicoin capital, Delphi ventures, Spartan Labs etc, and thus does not seek any grants through this grant program set by Questbook.",38

 Sinkas:

As the domain allocator, how do you plan on building and maintaining a pipeline of grant requests for your domain?


I intend to actively engage with the Arbitrum community through various channels, including forums, social media, and direct outreach to potential contributors. I will promote the availability of grants within my domain, encouraging individuals and teams to submit proposals for innovative projects in education, community growth, and events. Additionally, I will collaborate with existing community leaders and organizations to identify potential projects and encourage them to apply for grants.



 Sinkas:

What kind of rubrics will you set for your domain?


I will establish clear and transparent rubrics for evaluating grant requests in my domain. These rubrics will take into account factors such as project feasibility, impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem, alignment with community needs, and adherence to ethical and best practices. The rubrics will be designed to ensure fairness and consistency in the evaluation process.



 Sinkas:

How will the selected rubrics help you make a decision when assessing requests?


The selected rubrics will serve as a guideline for assessing grant requests. Each proposal will be evaluated based on these rubrics, allowing for an objective and standardized assessment. The rubrics will help me make informed decisions by providing a structured framework to assess the merit of each project and its potential to benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.



 Sinkas:

Is your schedule flexible enough to accommodate meetings with other domain allocators and the program manager to discuss program improvements and pain-points?

15759,JoJo,2023-09-08 18:24:44,"Hello everybody! Posting here the brief answer I gave in the call that is currently ongoing.
1. As the domain allocator, how do you plan on building and maintaining a pipeline of grant requests for your domain?
Idea is to be reachable in the very short term. What I want from the grantee requesters is to be able to pitch first their idea in a few sentence, and then expand on the pain points (which are always there) and related solutions, alongside the value proposition. My job will then be to evaluate, if available, more in depth docs and get back to a second meeting with the requestors to go into details. If both meetings will be positive, it can be a first solid base to proceed.
I also plan to keep contacts with the projects that will be approved for the grants afterwards, to keep a tab on how the funds are used and if the team is doing what is actually supposed to do. This is to both have internal metrics and also a general feedback on our role as domain controllers.
2. What kind of rubrics will you set for your domain?
Value proposition: how do you plan to bring value to Arbitrum ecosystem
Pain points: what flaws do you see in your model, and how do you plan to address it
Financial planning: how do you plan to use efficiently the funds. This is not trivial, at all.
Timeline: do you have a clear timeline for your project, and how do you plan to respect it
Team: do you have the people with the right skill now that you are applying? What gaps do you currently have and if so how do you plan to fill them?
3. How will the selected rubrics help you make a decision when assessing requests?
Pain points is even more important than values. For example, it’s easy to say “my project aims to bring sticky liquidity”. It’s difficult to answer how you are going to deal with the current difficult environment, or what you are planning to do when the first batch of resources you allocated to this goal will end, just to refer to the previous point.
Another crucial point in the team: world is plenty of good ideas, and also plenty of money to realise these ideas. What lacks is people able to actually implement these. A team that is missing key players needs to first enforce the roaster, and then ask for grants in my view.
4. Is your schedule flexible enough to accommodate meetings with other domain allocators and the program manager to discuss program improvements and pain-points?
I work in crypto full time, and interface myself with people from different timezones everyday. Also, I really like working on weekends when days are slow. And when I am not at my laptop, i think a lot about the challenges that arise everyday. So, when is going to be the time to communicate with the rest of the team, not only I am going to be available, I am going also to be quite efficient in doing so.
5. How will the community be able to communicate with you to offer feedback on your performance?
Everyone can reach me out, through Twitter, Discord or Telegram. I have no issue not only in chatting with anybody, but also in setting up calls if someone wants to communicate something more complex. Even if I have a 1h call with a new person that doesn’t lead to specific results, I would have still connected to that person, enlarge the network, have new ideas and have a new point of view I didn’t had before on a specific topic. To me, this is a huge value added to this position, and not a burden.",53

All applicants are invited to participate. Although the calls are conducted in Spanish, we have bilingual delegation members who provide live translation. @Saurabh visited us in the past when the Questbook proposal was under consideration. It is beneficial to be able to ask questions directly to the source and bridge the gap.
Thank you all

Arbitrum DAO Grants Domain Allocator Nominations Grants Discussions


    Hello fellow Arbinauts! 
I am here to apply as domain allocator for the “New Protocol Ideas”. 

Name : Apoorv Anand
Your forum username: apoorv9
Twitter: @Apoorvanand99

What is your experience in the interested domain? Please share links and supporting information. Do you have experience running in any other grant programs? 
Experience in interested domain : 


DeFi experience : Currently, I am part of the Stella Strategy and BD team. Stella is a leveraged strategy protocol with 0% cost to borr…
  

Hi everyone!
Summarizing my presentation here for your reference. My background is :

DeFi : I am a builder on Arbitrum. I do BD and Growth at Stella (a Arbitrum native protocol). Stella was previously Alpha Homora ($2B ATH TVL).
Grant experience : Worked at Alpha Incubate, where we incubated 8 projects that raised from Tier 1 VCs. Also, disbursed >$1M through grants at Flipkart Leap grants program across 16 projects.
NFT : Launched Firedrops (India’s first NFT marketplace) and NFT loyalty program.

Question 1 : As the domain allocator, how do you plan on building and maintaining a pipeline of grant requests for your domain?
I believe there are 3 parts to building and maintaing a pipeline of grants - awareness, application and feedback. Here is what I intend to do for each of them :

Awareness : Work alongside PM, delegates to set up a separate socials, amplify in community.
Application : Publish a guide on applying, best practices, clear rubric of evaluation.
Feedback : Every application gets to hear back in 14 days with feedback.


Question 2 : What kind of rubrics will you set for your domain? How will the selected rubrics help you make a decision when assessing requests?
The rubrics of selection would include :

Project Feasibility
Community Impact
Innovation and Creativity
Sustainability
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Due Diligence

Note that your rubrics should be adaptable and subject to periodic review to ensure they remain relevant to the evolving needs of the grant program.
The rubric includes both qualitative and quantitative evaluation points. I intend to do a weighted average of the different metrics to arrive at a final score for each application.

Question 3 : Is your schedule flexible enough to accommodate meetings with other domain allocators and the program manager to discuss program improvements and pain-points?
My current work is a full time BD role at Stella - a DeFi protocol on Arbitrum. I am perpetually online, and thus always available to get back to applicants or community members.

Question 4 : How will the community be able to communicate with you to offer feedback on your performance?
I intend to establish the following communitcation channels :

Communication channel : Separate running Forum Post or Discord
Feedback : Monthly google form to get feedback on performance as delegate. The results of this monthly feedback form will be shared with the community for maximum transparency.

Also, I also intend to make my personal TG and email public for community members to reach out.
For any other questions, feel free to reach out to me on TG(@apoorv99)

15759,jooooo5as,2023-09-09 07:44:50,"Thanks again for having organized the calls, also pasting my respective answers (now slightly amended).
1. As the domain allocator, how do you plan on building and maintaining a pipeline of grant requests for your domain?

would ideally use one major platform (Twitter) that could be complemented with the occasional report on other platforms. The idea is to keep it simple and also use Twitter as an onboarding funnel.
towards that end I’d plan to visually communicate any proposal’s performance against the decision rubric & turn early, successful proposals into case-studies. on twitter.
the exact strategy would have to be based on demand, synced with the program coordinator, and adjusted accordingly


2. What kind of rubrics will you set for your domain?

I generally see the QuestBook grants as a potentially great feeder program that can lead into larger grants. It’s small scale & has a very lean lean decision making.
Lets lean into this: make it relatively painless for funders/ organizers to get a relatively small amount of funds (to enable further time commitment & provide a positive signal).

On a more pragmatic level:


Differences from initially proposed rubric:  (1) no discretionary score (to avoid bias), (2) no assessment of product/ project (not vc funding, no excessive due dilligence required here, see this more akin to microgrants), (3) no dev reach category (b/c merit based, no selection for proven devs; would be the wrong grant for them anyway).


I’d go with a 5point likert scale per category and select the following tentative categories:
(1) appropriate scope, (2) demonstrated capability of team, (3) added-value to arbitrum, (4) realistic budget, and (5) communication strategy.


exact max grant size to be determined. possibly 5-10k. would reevaluate lowering the max grant size at defined milestones.



3. How will the selected rubrics help you make a decision when assessing requests?

would fully base any decision on the rubric
would define (1) aggregate cut-off values and (2) category-specific cut-off values for grant eligibility
would revise cut-off values after 1 month (with more data)
would revise cut-off values again at 3 months after start (or on community request)


4. Is your schedule flexible enough to accommodate meetings with other domain allocators and the program manager to discuss program improvements and pain-points?

I have a full-time engagement at an early-stage DeFi project
I should nonetheless be flexible enough most of the time; chronically online anyway & very flexible/ self-organized in my full-time engagement


5. How will the community be able to communicate with you to offer feedback on your performance?

would make sure there are push and pull channels available that both cater to asynchronous communication and the occasional live gmeets call
this being said, I’d hope to largely rely on Twitter for reporting on proposals and addressing any feedback. also as a means of marketing/ transparency / creating an onboarding funnel for future proposals.

15759,adamfzg,2023-09-10 19:57:57,"hi sir, I notice in all your communications that you speak in the collective (we, our etc), will you be the one serving on the council directly or will the person attending the meetings and calls be a rotation between several members at stable labs?
In how many different grants committees does stable labs participate?
Do you have a certain segment of innovation on Arbitrum that you personally have a deep interest in?",59
15759,cattin,2023-09-10 20:27:28,"Hey! Following up on this, here are our answers to these questions for those that missed our presentation.
1. As the domain allocator, how do you plan on building and maintaining a pipeline of grant requests for your domain?
As the domain allocator for this particular domain, which involves collaboration between SEED Latam, L2 en Español, and LayerX, we plan to build and maintain a pipeline of grant requests by implementing a structured and transparent process. Here’s how I intend to approach it:


Open and Ongoing Communication: We will establish clear communication channels and guidelines for potential grant applicants. This includes providing information about the application process, criteria, and expectations. We will ensure that interested parties are aware of how and where to submit their proposals.


Regular Outreach: we will proactively engage with the communities to encourage project ideas and grant proposals. Comms will be handled by SEED Latam, creating a channel on their discord. We’re going to provide grantees a space for them to have direct contact with us. Ideally, we should have weekly calls open for grantees after our governance calls, but this could change subject to their preferences (timezone, days, etc.)


Multi-regions: To reach a wider audience, we will encourage applicants to be from different regions of the world, we believe plurality is important for Arbitrum’s growth.


Documentation and Guidelines: we will create and maintain a comprehensive document that outlines the grant application process, eligibility criteria, and the types of projects we are looking for. This documentation will serve as a reference for potential applicants


Review Committee: we will assemble a review committee consisting of knowledgeable members from SEED Latam, L2 en Español, and LayerX communities. This committee will help assess grant proposals and ensure that they align with the domain’s objectives.


2. What kind of rubrics will you set for your domain?
The rubrics will be a set of clear and specific criteria against which grant proposals will be evaluated. These criteria will be designed to align with the priorities of the domain, which include hackathons, educational content and community growth initiatives, in that order of priority. The rubrics will encompass aspects like project team experience, Region and Scope, Other contributions, Others Grants, experience related to Arbitrum’s ecosystem and Sustainability.
In the following doc you can find more details on what information we would request from delegates and also a rough idea on how our rubrics would look like.
3. How will the selected rubrics help you make a decision when assessing requests?
The selected rubrics will serve as a structured framework for evaluating grant proposals. Each proposal will be assessed against these criteria, assigning scores or ratings for each criterion. This approach ensures that decisions are objective and transparent, as proposals will be evaluated consistently based on predefined standards.
4. Is your schedule flexible enough to accommodate meetings with other domain allocators and the program manager to discuss program improvements and pain-points?
As we said in our Domain allocation post, this nomination will be composed for 10 selected members of SEED Latam, L2 en Español, and LayerX. So our schedule will be flexible to accommodate meetings with other domain allocators and the program manager. We believe that collaboration and coordination among domain allocators are essential for program improvement and alignment.
5. How will the community be able to communicate with you to offer feedback on your performance?
To ensure transparency and accountability, I will establish communication channels through which the community can provide feedback on the performance. This can include a determined discord channel. we will be open to constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.
Our approach as the domain allocator will prioritize clear communication, structured evaluation criteria, flexibility for collaboration, and mechanisms for community feedback.

15759,Juandi,2023-09-10 21:14:57,"Addressing the previous questions (although on-call I answered a couple with a slideshow)
1. As the domain allocator, how do you plan on building and maintaining a pipeline of grant requests for your domain?
Questbook the startup hosting this grants ecosystem fund averages around 80k monthly visitors in ‘active grant seasons’ most of this are focused for protocols rather chains or ecosystems so normally these tend to get more hype and activity once launched and formally announced. There are also other ways to leverage this and following previous comments on the call one would be aligning with other domain allocators focusing on our weaknesses or on our categories that are ‘ripe for improvement’ and start building an ‘ideas to build on’ section followed by in-person hackathon sponsors mostly focused and launched by ETH Global (I personally know the core team and getting access to an event is rather linear).
2. What kinds of rubrics will you set for your domain?
Most of the rubrics are pretty straight-forward due to most of the grants being on an idea phase and waiting for their first check to further give the blank canvas some color. Still, in my forum/application for this domain you can check some of the questions and rubrics that will inspire the domain to foster, follow-up, and fund those who need it that most and bring them from 0 → 1. This questions and templates are inspired from six and seven figures community funds coming from Alcancía’s backers (Celo Community Fund, Compound, Aave, Push Protocol and more).
3. How will the selected rubrics help you make a decision when assessing requests?
The gut-feeling of being a resourceful founder is already something that gives the right touch when choosing based on intuition who is capable on developing the product. Other questions and templates provided in the evaluation rubric are to see how simple the grantee can explain the concept and produce an execution roadmap with milestone to further make the funding process more efficient and metric-based.
4. Is your schedule flexible enough to accommodate meetings with other domain allocators and the program manager to discuss program improvements and pain-points?
Of course, this isn’t a one-man army. The Alcancía blockchain development team will be lending a hand in reviewing the repositories and funding proposals. But if it was a one-man army I can easily be able to give more than 15 hours weekly.
5. How will the community be able to communicate with you to offer feedback on your performance?
All my public and private channels are open for feedback. Mostly recommend reaching by discord (Juandi#0382) or email (juandi@alcancia.io). I’ll also see if it’s possible with the program manager to open a forum post for each domain and its allocator for further feedback – grilling in public is essential.",61

In how many different grants committees does stable labs participate?


Hey @adamfzg, I will be the one serving on the council and attending all of the meetings. However, I will have the support of the entire StableLab team and will be able to leverage their vast knowledge and experience to make the most informed decisions.
StableLab sits on a variety of councils and committees which currently include the Compound Grants Committee, Uniswap Accountability Committee, and Rari’s Security Council.",64
15759,Bob-Rossi,2023-09-12 04:42:01,"I realized I missed this call, although I was out of town so would of missed it anyway… I know the vote is nearly over, but wanted to at least make a post. While I unfortunately missed it all, thank you to those who set the call up / participated!
1. As the domain allocator, how do you plan on building and maintaining a pipeline of grant requests for your domain?
Mainly through social media sites and forums. I’d plan to leverage the knowledge of the PM and other DA’s to establish proven methods to build and maintain an easy to access way to send ideas. I’d like to have applications run somewhere publicly for transparency on all parties. My goal would be to create an application experience that is as simple and transparent as possible to allow as many projects to come forward that is possible. While I would look to always be open to private contact, I’d like all my formal applications to be in a public setting so all can see.
2. What kind of rubrics will you set for your domain?
I’d admittedly be open to input from the PM and other DA’s in this area as well due to this being my first go at a project like this. Impact to Arbitrum, Team history / composition, timeline / milestones strike me as key goals. While I want to have some type of ‘reasonable chance of success’ scoring, I want to avoid weighting that too heavily to stifle innovation. Funding size will be an important metric, and since I am human I’d like to make metrics that can avoid as much human bias as possible… but some care will be taken to avoid a rubric that can be fairly easily gamed.
3. How will the selected rubrics help you make a decision when assessing requests?

Impact to Arbitrum - The more a project helps Arbitrum (and even Ethereum on the whole) the better. I do NOT want to punish projects that are also on other platforms, however points can be reduced if a project seems to be hunting for funding versus looking to form a symbiotic relationship.
Team History / Composition - Does the project have a successful past? Is there a verifiable social media and/or real life presence? I think in this case I don’t want to knock projects based solely on team size, but funding levels may need to reflect a project that has one. Projects that have had a history of working on Arbitrum (or even other Ethereum-centric L2s) would likely get points here as well
Timeline & Milestones - A clear and reasonably manageable timeline is important. Projects will get more points if they can demonstrate they have put effort and planning into their proposals. I would strongly encourage Milestones to keep projects on task.
Reasonable Chance of Success - I would like to have some metric here, but maybe a reduced weighting. I don’t want to create a situation of where future predictions are affecting funding, but there will have to be some type of reasonableness factor involved. In this I would be leaning more towards reasonableness in execution / timeline / scale… versus concept success.
Funding Reasonableness - Plainly, I’d like to make sure there is some kind of check on funding compared to the size of a project. This may also be of less weighting that other items, and mostly come down to avoiding funding a large portion of a budget to a singular project that has limited scope

4. Is your schedule flexible enough to accommodate meetings with other domain allocators and the program manager to discuss program improvements and pain-points?
I do work a full time job, although I have relative flexibility in terms of time spent outside my work hours, afternoons / evenings / weekends. I went into this knowing that, and I I can stick with my aforementioned 48 hr. response time, up to 15 hours a week as noted in my application. I want to do my best to accommodate time zones, but I don’t want to mislead voters either. Written communication I’d be pretty flexible, even during my work hours (to echo others, I’m chronically online  ). My biggest restriction would likely be calls during my work period.
5. How will the community be able to communicate with you to offer feedback on your performance?
Socials - This forum, Reddit, Twitter. I do have a discord & email I use. I will echo what I said above, I’d actually prefer feedback to be public if possible / appropriate. I realize that I work for the DAO, so I think in this case public feedback is good.",66
15759,krst,2023-09-12 16:33:10,"The below response reflects the views of L2BEAT’s governance team, composed of @krst and @Sinkas, and it’s based on the combined research, fact-checking and ideation of the two.
After carefully examining all nominees for each domain separately, and after facilitating two “pitching” sessions to hear the nominees out (in which a total of 15 nominees participated), we’ve decided that we’ll be voting for the following people:
Gaming Domain

@Flook

Dev Tooling on Nova Domain

@Juandi

New Protocol Ideas Domain

@Matt_StableLab

Education, Community Growth, and Events Domain

@cattin

It was really difficult to decide which people we’ll vote for because there were so many great nominees to choose from and it’s a pity that we could only vote for 1 in each domain. Having said that, we’d like to encourage the community to think of ways we can get more people from the list of nominees involved with the DAO somehow, and we invite everyone to discuss that during the 6th Open Governance Call which will take place on Wednesday September 20th, at 16:00 UTC / 12:00 UTC (add the Arbitrum Governance Calendar to your calendar to make sure you don’t miss it).
You can also join our L2BEAT Arbitrum Office Hours on every Thursday at 15:00 UTC if you’d like to discuss this or any other issue regarding Arbitrum ecosystem.",68
15759,Michigan_Blockchain,2023-09-12 18:20:43,"First of all, we would like to thank Questbook for running a successful Domain Allocator Nomination process. We have set the foundation for a program with great potential this round and beyond. The Domain Allocator program has received so many great nominees, and we would also like to thank all of them for their applications and time spent on the process.
The following reflects the decisions of Michigan Blockchain’s governance team after reviewing and deliberating on the Domain Allocator nominations:
For the Gaming Domain, we will be voting for @Flook (application): We appreciated their in-depth response that displayed clear experience having developed games as the founder of Merlyn Labs for Arbitrum’s Treasure ecosystem and previous collaborations with major gaming studios such as Atari and Volta. Their expertise in blockchain game development will allow them to support grant applicants throughout the funding process and beyond. Due to the small value of grants in each Domain, we support their vision of promoting a diverse set of dedicated game developers to build out a thriving gaming ecosystem for current Arbitrum users and more so to bring in new participants and gaming enthusiasts. While their involvement in Merlyn Labs does pose a minor conflict of interest, which they stated, we believe their goal of transparency and the accountability fostered by the Questbook system and program will ensure a fair, effective process.
For the Dev Tooling on Nova Domain, we will be voting for @Juandi (application): With their extensive experience and continued success developing tools and applications in the space, we look forward to seeing their support of the Arbitrum Nova ecosystem. Their vision was the most thorough and touched on many of the points the Nova protocol could improve upon. Their relationships with so many players across the greater blockchain space will also allow them to support grant applicants as well as attract more participants to Nova as a smaller Anytrust protocol.
For the Community, Education, and Events Domain, we will be voting for @Shreddy (application): Shreddy has an extensive track record and impressive experience working with communities across the crypto space. We give a lot of credit to Shreddy for their effort and success in building out successful programs for OlympusDAO and KlimaDAO among others. We appreciated their thorough criteria for application evaluation and along with their vision will foster an effective grants program that propels the growth of the Arbitrum community and ecosystem.
For the New Protocol Ideas Domain, we will be voting for @Matt_StableLab (application): StableLabs has a strong reputation of promoting community and governance growth and participation as well as experience leading grants programs (including Questbook’s with Compound). We align with their vision for developing the best user experience on Arbitrum and appreciated their complete evaluation process with thorough explanations as to how each criterion could be met. Having the support of the StableLabs team, we believe Matt will serve as an effective Domain Allocator to properly allocate grants and support the funded teams during and beyond the program.
Thank you again to all of the nominees for their applications. We appreciate all your efforts. This was a difficult decision and we look forward to supporting the Domain Allocators and the Questbook team however we can to ensure a successful first Grants Program. We believe the Arbitrum DAO is quickly aligning its community and driving forward as a leader in the governance space as we support and build a thriving ecosystem.",69

15759,Blueweb,2023-11-21 12:44:21,"HI @Srijith-Questbook,
Most queries are about the first acknowledgement that the application is in review. If that can be initiated whenever the domain allocator starts in-depth understanding.
Then is the time for approval or rejection, which can be 7/10/15 days if not less.
Some are around closed-door approvals where the application doesn’t contain the entire proposal in the desired format but still gets approved because of a conversation that has happened off the platform. I think this can be addressed by keeping the conversation on Questbook or MoMs from calls being commented on in the application window.
Again these are mere suggestions by which transparency and turnaround can be improved. I believe Questbook has the right expertise to deal with it.
Kudos to the great work!",80

Also, we have reserved the operational expenses in the grants SAFE. I initially transferred all the 800k Arb into each of the 4 domains, at 200k Arb each, and later realized that the compensation of the allocators and operational expenses need to be safeguarded. Later I had transferred the budgeted compensation back to the main grants SAFE with the exception of the education domain remaining. This can be clearly tracked on the Multisigs.",81

We’d love to get feedback from the community here on the proposals that have been accepted, and any of the other proposals that have been posted on Questbook. Happy to clear any doubts about the program, or proposals, either from Questbook or the domain allocators.",82
15759,Bob-Rossi,2023-12-13 14:24:33,"Thank you for the continued updates on the project! It looks like a lot of projects are getting funded, and appreciate the transparency.",83
15759,dk3,2023-12-14 06:22:12,"A lot of rad stuff, esp in dev tooling.  It would be cool for the projects once complete to do a little pitch session to delegates/community. Could even be pre-recorded, but I think its powerful when developers pitch/showcase the projects they built, the backstories, and why they think its important.
Food for thought, but i would enjoy watching/being involved with all the pitches.",84
15759,Srijith-Questbook,2023-12-14 06:40:56,"Thank your @Bob-Rossi for your comments, it validates the work the Domain allocators, the grantees, proposers have put in weekly to make the program as successful as it can be. We commit to keep being fully transparent with all details around the program.",85
15759,Srijith-Questbook,2023-12-14 06:43:12,"Thank you for your comments @dk3 we are planning to have a demo day towards the end of the program for the community! All the grantees will present their project live and you can learn more about their projects and stories on demo day. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the projects, and your support to all the teams involved!",86
15759,Juandi,2023-12-17 15:16:52,"Appreciate the kudos on the dev tooling domain dk3.
Truly some talented builders who are product and company-first. Hopefully we see a lot more impact during the grants program.",87
15759,cattin,2023-12-18 17:17:15,"Report N°1: Arbitrum Education, Community Growth and Events Domain
This report describes the development of the Arbitrum Education, Community Growth and Events domain. So far I’ve been leading a joint work with SEEDLatam, L2 en español, and LayerX. In this report, we will cover the development and execution to date, with a final report at the culmination of this program.
Evaluation system
This document expresses our approach to evaluating the proposals received as domain allocators. The focal point was the organization of various events such as hackathons, bootcamps, webinars, and other similar activities. We emphasized that the proposals should preferably be related to educational institutions to bring Arbitrum closer to a more academic environment. These events were key touchpoints in our overall strategy to foster education and community growth.
Aspect 1: Proposal ideas
During the review of the proposals, we paid attention to those related to hackathons and workshops, especially those related to academic institutions such as universities or schools.
Aspect 2: Budget Description
An integral aspect of our process involved conducting a thorough analysis of the budget for each project. Our objective was to present a detailed breakdown, justifying each fund request and outlining its specific use. This meticulous examination aimed to ensure transparency and accountability in financial matters.
Aspect 3: Regional Diversity
In parallel, we set out to achieve global impact. By actively soliciting proposals from different communities and countries, our intention is to cultivate language, regional, and cultural diversity. This aims to achieve a broader reach that will benefit Arbitrum.
For this reason, we promote the domain in several languages, and we also advertise it in different communities:

Discord Channels
In order to improve the communication between the proposal builders and the Domain allocator team, we established dedicated Discord forum channels, each serving as a dynamic platform for seamless communication, timely updates, and clarifications.
Our initiative was to ensure transparency throughout the entire process. To achieve this, all communication channels were configured to be public. This deliberate decision fosters openness and facilitates a broader community engagement by allowing interested parties to follow the discussions and updates in real time.
292×747 27.3 KB
Is important to clarify that everyone has access to these channels to be part of the discussion or see the interaction between the proposer builder and the Domain allocator team.
Work distribution
As detailed in the domain presentation, the team was composed of 5 members of Seed Latam, L2 en español, and Layer X, led by myself. Proposals were evaluated in depth, and questions from bidders were answered, exceeding the number of hours allocated to the domain with fast and fluid responses. As mentioned above, these conversations were public, we also had meetings with the proposers to improve some aspects of their proposal.
The team evaluated each proposal, with my vote as team leader having more weight in case a consensus was not reached. This allows us to make in-depth evaluations of each proposal.
We would like to emphasize that we also carry out diffusion tasks of the domain so that more interested parties, communities, and working groups can approach Arbitrum.
Proposal’s Map

The map presented shows an approximate representation of the regions and countries where all the approved projects are located, providing a global view of the different communities covered by the domain.
We will also update the map at the end of the domain, in this way, we try to have a global vision of the regions that we have not yet covered.
Please let us know if you think there are errors in this map, we are open to feedback.

Things to improve
During our process as Domain Allocators, we encountered several challenges. One notable difficulty was the large number of high-level proposals, which complicated the project selection process. Hours were spent studying project budgets in detail, focusing primarily on ensuring projects were of the highest quality at the best price.
Another challenge was the diversity of projects coming from different countries, each with its own regional pricing. This required a concerted effort to match prices with domain costs, which added an additional layer of complexity to our responsibilities.
We would also like to clarify that the domain has a duration of 6 months, this implies that the proposals must be within this time range, so the evaluation also went through the execution time. This also meant that we had many proposals accepted in this first phase since most of them take between 2 and 3 months of execution, considering that the Christmas and end-of-year dates are in between.
In response to the evolving challenges, we initiated improvements to streamline certain processes. Following thorough evaluations of multiple projects, we automated key procedures, such as template usage and rubric assessments. This strategic move aimed not only to enhance efficiency but also to conserve valuable time resources for more strategic decision-making.
Conclusions
The Domain Allocator process is a meticulous undertaking that demands dedicated effort from each team member. It entails a keen understanding of identifying nuanced details within proposals to ensure informed decision-making. As of the current update, we have received a total of 31 proposals. Among these, 8 have been approved, 13 were regrettably rejected, and 10 are currently undergoing thorough evaluations.
Our allotted budget for this program stands at $200,000. At present, the approved projects account for a total expenditure of 100,525.00. In light of our expectations, it appears that there may be room to accommodate only 4 or 5 more projects within our budgetary constraints.
After the Domain Allocators grants program concludes, we are committed to presenting a comprehensive report to the Arbitrum community.",88

15759,JoJo,2023-12-27 18:31:26,"Report N°1: Arbitrum New Protocols and Ideas Domain
This report describes the development of the Arbitrum New Protocols and Ideas domain. I have been currently leading the domain alone, and in this report I will cover all the applications and what has been achieved up to this point.
Brief description about the domain
The “new protocols and ideas” domain covers such a large and vast array of potential use cases. It can be quite difficult if not impossible to summarize it all, so a non-exhaustive list of in-scope projects includes:

Creating new protocols from scratch, with special attention to those not currently prevalent in Arbitrum or those that introduce new functionalities and ideas.
Developing infrastructure/services to enhance the experience of Arbitrum users.
Adding new functionalities to existing protocols/products already on the Arbitrum chain.
Expanding or migrating an existing protocol/product from other chains to Arbitrum.

In any of the scenarios mentioned above, or in any other cases, we aim as end result to have a fully functional protocol/product, at least in its basic features, that users can engage with. The proposal’s scope must ultimately offer tangible value to the Arbitrum chain by producing a functional deliverable.
Evaluation system
There are several key challenges in the ‘new protocols and ideas’ domain, particularly due to its breadth. This has led to a high volume of very heterogeneous applications, making it challenging to evaluate each idea on its own merits. As such, the following concepts were considered fundamental for the approval of a grant:

Team composition: Given the nature of the grant program, which offers only a small amount (up to $25,000 equivalent in ARB), projects applying for the grant must have a complete team. Submitting a grant request without key figures in place significantly reduces the chances of the grant being successful.
Business model: At Questbook, we aim for the grant to not just serve its immediate purpose but also to kickstart a positive cycle for both the team and the product. This is only feasible if, alongside the grant, the team presents a forward-looking business model capable of sustaining the project.
Product-market fit: The idea must be capable of creating value, either by filling an existing demand/gap or by generating demand in a new market. An example of the former could be the NFT category, and an example of the latter might be tools related to governance, as will be seen in the subsequent examples of approved proposals.

Domain Overview

Number of proposals: 40
Number of proposals accepted: 9 (one is a typo that got resubmitted)

Proposal categorization
As of the 27th of December, this is a classification of all the submitted proposals.
Screenshot 2023-12-27 alle 19.15.331188×698 84.7 KB
As we can see, two categories are the most frequent: DeFi and Infrastructure. This was quite foreseeable, given that we are generally observing the growth of Layer 2 (L2) ecosystems. There remains a huge untapped market in what are still considered the largest and most generic sectors.
This is the sub-categorization breakdown of the DeFi and Infrastructure proposals.
New protocols and Ideas - Sub Categories DeFi1196×712 54.8 KB
It’s intriguing to note that the ‘Derivatives’ sub-category, which encompasses perpetuals and options among others, is the most prominent. This trend might suggest that Arbitrum is still perceived as the primary hub for derivatives. This indicates how the ecosystem could focus specific efforts in the future.
New protocols and Ideas - Sub Categories Infrastructure1216×708 59 KB
In the Infrastructure category, we observe a split in the sub-categories between on/off-ramp applications and labeling ones. The on/off-ramp sector appears to be quite location-specific at the moment, with all applications in this analysis coming from Latin America. There’s a noticeable demand for solutions that facilitate user onboarding and transactions between the fiat and crypto worlds. This sector demonstrates a strong product-market fit for L2 solutions, especially as a way to bypass the high gas fees of the main net.
The labeling sector is arguably more intriguing and complex to analyze. Labeling, or ‘data enrichment,’ is a common practice in certain fields, such as cybersecurity. An increasing demand for labeling tools suggests a surge in data volume, necessitating more thorough analysis. This trend is evident in platforms like Arkham and Breadcrumbs, signaling overall growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Proposals Accepted
The following is a list of all the accepted projects, with a summary of the proposal and related details.
Pear Protocol

Pear Protocol is a decentralised exchange for pairs trading, where users are long one asset and short another at the same time. For example, long $ARB / short $OP. The aim is for DeFi users to be able to leverage first GMX, and in future other exchanges, in a capital efficient way based on prevailing narratives. The protocol is currently live on Arbitrum Mainnet and in closed beta to 100 users. The proposal aim to build the RFQ-API module, to allow market makers to access the protocol through advanced features and their internal engines, thus providing liquidity to the underneath platform and generating volume in the Arbitrum ecosystem
Funding Allocated: 15.000$
Milestones: Pear Protocol to go live on Arbitrum Mainnet (7,500$), Deliver an RFQ-API to trade on Arbitrum Mainnet facing off-chain solvers (7,500$).
Funding disbursed: 0$
The project taps into a market that is quite common in traditional finance but not yet fully developed in the crypto sphere: pair trading. While it is technically feasible to long one asset and short another on-chain, the absence of a single platform for executing and managing these positions, particularly in terms of collateral, is currently the largest barrier. The Pear Protocol addresses this need by filling the gap, with the secondary effect of being built atop other successful protocols, thereby creating a beneficial flywheel effect.

Clique

The proposal by Clique aims at enhancing Arbitrum’s gaming identity layer. Their main product, Identity Oracles, allows users to securely transfer their identity and behavioral data from various web2 platforms (like Twitter, Steam, Github, Spotify, Discord) to the blockchain, preserving privacy. This technology is expected to improve user segmentation, directional incentives, Sybil resistance, and identity-weighted governance in DeFi and gaming sectors. The grant will fund the deployment of their open-source attestation registry, Verax, and incentivize the Arbitrum gaming community to engage with the project through gaming identity badges, loyalty rewards, and raffles. The ultimate goal is to become the leading identity issuer on Arbitrum, enhancing data insights and user acquisition for the ecosystem.
Funding Allocated: 15,000$
Milestones: Verax Deployment on Arbitrum One (5,000$), Growth Activation (10,000$, with mid tier internal milestones of 4,000$, 3,000$, 3,000$ based on users claiming their gaming ID badges).
Funding disbursed: 0$
The Clique proposal addresses an increasingly significant issue in the crypto world: establishing on-chain identities that are linked to off-chain data. Although its initial use case is primarily in gaming, which might categorize it under the ‘Gaming’ domain, there is a plan to expand the protocol to include non-gaming identities. Arbitrum, with its fast and inexpensive transactions, serves as an ideal testing ground for such innovations. The proposal has been crafted to enhance familiarity and adoption of the protocol among the user base.

Crypto No Pix

Crypto No Pix’s proposal seeks a $10,000 grant to integrate their Brazilian cryptocurrency platform with Arbitrum projects. The platform, known for simplifying cryptocurrency access, aims to utilize PIX, Brazil’s efficient payment method, to facilitate secure and rapid transactions. Cripto No Pix has gained traction with its presence in over 70 active Telegram groups and processes around $500,000 monthly on the BNB Chain. The proposal’s objective is to extend these services to the Arbitrum community, enhancing user experience with a user-friendly interface and fostering community growth. The plan includes two phases: integrating Cripto No Pix technology with a CEX such as Binance and two DEXs, Uniswap and Camelot. The team brings extensive experience in blockchain and marketing. The end goal is to achieve full integration with Arbitrum, allowing on-ramp and off-ramp directly from the Arbitrum Main net within 60 days. The proposal also includes Telegram integration to engage their large user base.
Funding Allocated: 10,000$
Milestones: Full integration of Arbitrum (On-ramp and Off-ramp with PIX Technology) + Telegram BOT integrations (10,000$).
Funding disbursed: 10,000$ (9,009 ARB)
Crypto No Pix exemplifies the on/off-ramp narrative prevalent in certain geographies, such as Latin America. Their proposal primarily focuses on simplifying the process of buying and selling crypto through mobile apps and other services. This approach is less common in some regions but appears to be well-utilized in others. The team has already demonstrated a functional project with a solid user base and traction on the Binance chain. Therefore, it seems logical to support such players in expanding their services to Arbitrum, as this could significantly boost adoption.

Amelia, the Arbitrum AI Copilot - Chat Based Assistant

Amelia, the Arbitrum AI Copilot, is a chat-based assistant designed to streamline the web3 experience for users at various expertise levels, including developers, investors, traders, and enthusiasts. Amelia will be accessible as both a web application and a Discord bot, providing personalized assistance and serving as an information hub with data analytics, wallet integration, and a unique credit system. The project aims to make web3 and Arbitrum protocols more accessible and user-friendly. Amelia will offer tailored responses to suit different user personas: beginners, advanced users, and those preferring a casual approach. Features include the ability to copy text or code, provide feedback, and share chat sessions. It will also provide essential Arbitrum statistics like market overviews and NFT collection details. The team has set milestones for the project, including the production of a functioning dApp, achieving user targets, and deploying the Discord bot in DAOs, with specific grant allocations for each milestone. The budget is allocated for development, design, infrastructure costs (like OpenAI APIs, deployment, and hosting), and potential post-development and marketing expenses.
Funding Allocated: 8,000$
Milestones: Production of a Functioning dApp integrating data for Arbitrum DAOs and Protocols such as Arbitrum, Jones, Dopex, Radiant, Dolomite, GMX and Camelot (4,000$), First Set of 250 Users Achieved (1,000$), Second Set of 250 Users Achieved (1,000$), Production of a Functioning Discord Bot for Amelia (1,000$), Deployment of the Discord Bot in five different DAOs (1,000$, broke down in tranches of 200$).
Funding disbursed: 0$
AI is undoubtedly the trend of the moment, with a widespread eagerness to integrate it into various applications. This is evident in the numerous AI-powered bot proposals we have received, each with its unique capabilities. Among these, Amelia stands out for two key reasons. Firstly, the team has already developed a functioning version on the Polygon network. Secondly, and more importantly, they have demonstrated an ability to adapt to suggestions and use cases. While the former is commendable, the latter is crucial for our purposes. We prioritize deliverables that align with market needs, meaning they must offer tangible value to users. This focus on user needs is exemplified in how the bot was tailored. Amelia doesn’t just process documentation from major Arbitrum protocols; it also excels in user experience implementation. This adaptability extends to practical applications, such as integrating the bot into Discord for specific Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) with specialized knowledge. Such a feature can significantly aid project contributors by automating tasks like support ticket redirection and managing the often burdensome aspect of customer support.

Smilee LP & IG Simulator with IL Hedge

The proposal by Smilee, an on-chain options protocol, requested a grant for the development of a unique simulator tool. Smilee, known for introducing the first-ever ‘Impermanent Gain’ options, caters to traders, protocols, and treasuries with products that allow speculation, hedging, and structuring around volatility. The protocol features two primary offerings: Trade and Earn, leveraging Impermanent Gain Options with up to 1,000x leverage and no liquidations, and generating real yield in stablecoins by transforming LPs into Options sellers. The proposed simulator aims to provide users with the ability to simulate and calculate LP exposure, breaking down major LP components and Impermanent Loss. It will also enable users to simulate Impermanent Gain scenarios and offer ways to hedge IL through Smilee. This tool is crucial for providing clarity, transparency, and potential insurance to DEX DeFi investors. Additionally, it’s a step towards a larger initiative, a full-fledged DeFi Risk Dashboard, which will facilitate cross-protocol investments, attract liquidity, and serve as infrastructure for novel risk tools. The Smilee team is composed of 12 members with diverse expertise in development, business, marketing, and quantitative analysis, with experience in DeFi, traditional finance, derivatives, and options. The milestones for the grant include the launch of the Smilee Protocol on the Arbitrum Mainnet in January 2024, a necessary first step to ensure the viability of the deliverable, and the release of the IG & LP Simulator Dashboard in February 2024. The grant will be fully utilized for the development and release of the LP & IG Simulator.
Funding Allocated: 8,000$
Milestones: Smilee Protocol Launch on Arbitrum Mainnet (4,000$), Releases the IG & LP Simulator Dashboard (4,000$).
Funding disbursed: 0$
The team aims to capitalize on what appears to be a currently underexplored market: options. Although various protocols are addressing options, the field is largely still in the research and development (R&D) phase. Most protocols are concurrently searching for a Product-Market Fit (PMF) and a universally applicable framework. Smilee, in this context, is adopting a two-pronged approach. Firstly, it plans to utilize user-provided collateral to facilitate exposure to options. Secondly, it introduces an innovative concept of ‘impermanent gain’ unique to its protocol. The merit of this idea is clear, and the grant will contribute to the development of a user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard will enable users to calculate their positions in terms of liquidity provision, assess risk tolerance, track incurred Impermanent Loss (IL), and understand the impermanent gain specific to the Smilee platform. Such a tool will be valuable not only to Smilee users but also to the broader Arbitrum user base. Additionally, this dashboard is envisioned as a foundational element for a subsequent project by the same team, designed to synergize specifically with Smilee’s features.

Arbitrum Governance Tracker

Build3rs Labs proposed to develop an analytics system for the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their primary goal is to enhance transparency in governance by providing real-time data and alerts on governance activities to a wide audience, including blockchain newcomers, developers, and investors. This initiative builds on their success in winning three recent blockchain hackathons.
The proposed Arbitrum Governance Tracker will monitor and report activities on the Snapshot platform, making governance proposals and discussions easily accessible and understandable. It’s designed to support community participation in governance by providing detailed information about new proposals, proposal statuses, vote tracking, and voting results. This bot will reach a larger audience through social media platforms, particularly Twitter, under the handle @ArbitrumGovernance.
The bot’s features will include activity tracking, a tweeting mechanism for delivering governance data, and scheduled updates for aggregated data. It will integrate with Twitter and Snapshot APIs, ensuring accurate real-time updates. The development process includes unit testing and deployment on a secure hosting platform.
The project, expected to complete in five weeks, will initially release a Telegram bot (V1) followed by a Twitter system (V2). The budget will cover developer compensation, hosting, maintenance, and server costs.
The analytics system aligns with the Arbitrum ecosystem’s values by promoting transparency, encouraging participation, and supporting decentralization. Success metrics include retweets, likes, community engagement rate, follower growth, and data accuracy and speed. Long-term, Build3rs Labs plans to evolve the system, explore partnerships, and contribute to Arbitrum’s growth through various initiatives.
Funding Allocated: 9,500$
Milestones: Arbitrum Governance V1 on Telegram (4,500$), Arbitrum Governance Final Version on Twitter (5,000$).
Funding disbursed: 0$
The team began their journey in Questbook with an entirely different concept: a Twitter bot tracking specific activities on certain exchanges. While this initial idea had its merits, their current iteration offers distinct value to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The complexity and challenges of governance, especially evident during periods like the recent STIP, are well-known. This new tool aims to simplify the tracking of ongoing events on Snapshot, including the status of voting. Initially available on Telegram and subsequently on Twitter, it will enable everyone to follow the bot for real-time, transparent updates on delegate activities. Moreover, this bot has the potential to serve as the basis for a business model for Build3rs Labs. The team has shown remarkable flexibility, completely pivoting from their original idea. They embraced this new direction and engaged in brainstorming sessions with me to refine a model that could be viable as a business, particularly for other major DAOs. These organizations could benefit from a streamlined, transparent method to report Snapshot activities, seeing the value in reducing friction in governance reporting.

Mountain Protocol USDM

The proposal from Mountain Protocol seeks to deploy its native USDM stablecoin on Arbitrum and incentivize Automated Market Maker (AMM) liquidity. USDM is a permissionless and regulated yield-bearing USD stablecoin, fully backed by US Treasuries. This deployment aims to allow builders to use USDM as a foundational element for various financial products and payment solutions.
USDM offers a notable feature of rebasing daily, currently at a 5% Annual Percentage Yield (APY), which makes holding USD in crypto more attractive. Its introduction to the Arbitrum ecosystem is anticipated to enhance the creation of better financial products, ranging from lending collateral to sustainable liquidity pool returns.
Mountain Protocol requested $25,000 in funding, divided into two tranches. The initial $15,000 is for bootstrapping liquidity post-contract deployment. The second tranche, contingent on achieving a minimum liquidity of $250,000, will further support liquidity enhancement, providing a safeguard for the Arbitrum team against underperformance.
USDM boasts several safety features: solvency (backed by short-term US Treasuries in segregated, bankruptcy-remote accounts), liquidity (redeemable at $1 by Primary Clients, with partnerships like the one with Wintermute for large-scale redemptions), price stability (maintains a stable price around $1, facilitated by easy arbitrage opportunities for Primary holders), security (the rebasing ERC-20 contract has been audited by OpenZeppelin, adhering to high-quality standards including access control roles and formal verification), regulatory clarity (Mountain Protocol is regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, ensuring compliance with the Digital Asset Business Act), governance (upholds high governance standards with independent directors, third-party signers, independent auditors, and regular attestations).
The Mountain Protocol team, co-founded by Martin Carrica and Matias Caricato, brings significant expertise in banking and technology. It has received backing from notable entities like Castle Island Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, and others. The company is a regulated entity, subject to extensive oversight. This proposal represents a strategic move to integrate USDM into the Arbitrum ecosystem, potentially revolutionizing financial product development and enhancing the usability of stablecoins.
Funding Allocated: 25,000$
Milestones: Deploy USDM natively on Arbitrum (10,000$), Reach 250k AMM pool size (15,000$).
Funding disbursed: 0$
USDM falls under the Real World Assets (RWA) category. It’s a rebase stablecoin that generates yield from real-world assets. This narrative has been gaining traction recently, and a project with solid regulatory foundations like USDM is certainly well-positioned to be a key player. Introducing USDM to Arbitrum will enable its users to access off-chain yield, subject to more rigorous scrutiny compared to other companies. However, achieving this requires significant initial effort, particularly in establishing deep liquidity for the platform. This can only be accomplished through the initial incentivization of the liquidity pool, which involves carefully balancing incentives against the potential Annual Percentage Rate (APR) needed to reach a critical Total Value Locked (TVL) mass. This is why, in this particular case, I decided to deviate from my usual rule of avoiding grants for incentives. The situation demanded such an approach (as did a few other cases). As the application process progresses, we are also in discussions with Camelot to potentially gain additional support for incentivizing the pool. This would further enhance the growth and effectiveness of the platform.

Sweep n’ Flip | NFT DEX

Sweep n’ Flip is a NFT DEX & Marketplace Aggregator. This platform brings the traditional dynamics of 50/50 Automated Market Makers (AMMs) into the realm of NFTs. The innovation lies in its ability to provide instant swaps, enhance liquidity, and boost trading volume, thus addressing some of the challenges in the NFT market.
While allowing users to buy or sell NFTs instantly through the Sweep n’ Flip platform, Liquidity Providers have the opportunity to earn trading fees. The platform’s main goal is to reproduce the well-established AMM models to NFT collections, thereby trying to solve liquidity issues and enabling efficient trading mechanisms.
The team behind Sweep n’ Flip has the goal to roll out functionalities such as the Zap Functionality, which streamlines the process of providing liquidity into a single transaction, enhancing user experience, and the plan to introduce additional pool options, enabling the creation of custom pools with various ERC20/NFT collection pairs, thus expanding trading pairs normally available. Furthermore, a farming mechanism is in the pipeline, where users can stake their LP tokens and earn rewards, incentivizing participation in the platform.
To kickstart the project, Sweep n’ Flip is seeking funding that is primarily allocated for setting up initial liquidity pools and launching incentive campaigns, while at the same time approaching their community via Discord to decide which Arbitrum collections to start operations with.
For their official launch, the team is eyeing a Total Value Locked (TVL) of 10k USD. To achieve this, a part of the grant will focus on amplifying B2C activations and scaling the TVL of the selected pools through Liquidity Mining. The plan is to double the TVL to $10,000 USD, setting the stage for the next milestone.
The third phase, with a further tranche of the grant, aims to expand the liquidity pools further… The goal for Sweep n’ Flip is not just to create a functional platform but to establish a robust ecosystem on Arbitrum in the NFT segment.
Funding Allocated: 7,500$
Milestones: Initial pre-launch liquidity (5,000$), Launch and expansion of liquidity pools (1,250$), Further liquidity boost (1,250$)
Funding disbursed: 0$
The initial assessment of Sweep n’ Flip’s funding proposal, supported by data from Dune Analytics and DeFiLlama, revealed that their original funding request, which differed from the granted amount, seemed to exceed what their current metrics justified. However, providing this funding was considered necessary to jumpstart their platform in the relatively untapped NFT market on Arbitrum. The initially requested amount for incentivizing the Arbitrum pool appeared excessive, especially when compared to the platform’s performance history across various chains. Consequently, a revised and more reasonable amount was proposed for the incentives. This new figure aligns better with the platform’s existing transaction volumes and is aimed at ensuring sustainable growth. To effectively manage the funds, a phased funding strategy has been adopted. The disbursement of funds is contingent upon the achievement of specific milestones, ensuring the project’s viability and keeping the public engaged. The NFT market in Arbitrum is undoubtedly underserved, and initiatives like Sweep n’ Flip are pivotal in steering the platform in the right direction.

One Click Crypto: Arbitrum Public Yield Explorer

One Click Crypto has the mission to simplify and democratize access to DeFi products, according to the team. Their aim is to guide users into the myriad of yield farming pools, liquidity mining programs, and staking opportunities.
The team behind One Click Crypto has the vision for to establish their project, in Arbitrum, as a central hub for DeFi yield users, catering to both retail and institutional participants. They plan to achieve this by developing user-friendly web3 products that navigate Arbitrum’s DeFi landscape, thus facilitating informed decision-making and attracting more users and capital.
One Click Crypto’s proposal includes the development of a Public Arbitrum DeFi Yield Explorer. This platform will serve as a comprehensive database of yield opportunities on Arbitrum, integrating real-time data feeds, risk assessments, and a yield composability map. This initiative aims to bring transparency and ease of access to Arbitrum’s DeFi offerings, making it simpler for users to engage with various yield strategies.
The funding of the grant will be allocated across several milestones, including the implementation of the yield database, asset and protocol databases, an enhanced pool database, and a “one-click zap” functionality for easy pool access. These milestones are designed to incrementally build upon each other, each with specific performance indicators like the number of unique app users and wallets using the new functionalities. The grant distribution covers various aspects such as backend and infrastructure, frontend development, research, and management. Through these developments, One Click Crypto aims to significantly enhance the Arbitrum ecosystem, making it more accessible, transparent, and user-friendly for a broader audience.
This project is part of a larger one, that include crypto indexes managend, in composition terms, by a combination of the yield composability discussed in the grant proposal and artificial intelligence.
Funding Allocated: 22,000$
Milestones: Implementation of the public Arbitrum yield database + 5,000 cumulative unique users (6,850$), Implementation of Assets and Protocol databases + 10,000 cumulative unique users (6,500$), Implementation of Pool database v2: Layer of depth + 20,000 cumulative unique users (4,650$), Implementation of the “one-click zap” functionality for Arbitrum pools + 300 users of the zap (4,000$)
Funding disbursed: 0$
One Click team wants to position itself as the central hub in the DeFi yield space, choosing Arbitrum as their launch pad. This strategic decision underlines their commitment to leveraging Arbitrum’s growing ecosystem to kickstart their journey. The roadmap of One Click goes beyond offering standard yield services; they aim to address a notable gap in the crypto domain, such as the lack of a comprehensive composability map for yield. This map, currently non-existent in the crypto world, is part of One Click’s future roadmap.
The grant awarded to One Click lays the foundation for these, I have to say, ambitious objectives: enabling the creation of essential building blocks that will form the core of One Click’s offerings. These building blocks are key not only for the development of the composability map but also for the creation of specialized products, such as a crypto index and AI-driven portfolio management solutions. The team behind One Click recognizes a significant segment of potential users who are interested in diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum but lack the expertise to make informed investment decisions. One Click’s approach, therefore, is not just about providing tools but also about educating and guiding users. Over time, this strategy has the potential to onboard a substantial number of users, offering them a more nuanced exposure to the crypto world and empowering them to make smarter investment choices.

Things to improve
As highlighted by @cattin in the ‘Education, Community Growth, and Events’ section, a few challenges arose in the program.
The first challenge is the broad nature of the domain. ‘New protocols and ideas’ encompass such a wide range of proposals that any not specifically tied to other domains (Education & Community, Gaming, Arbitrum Nova, and Developing Tooling) inevitably fall into this category. This leads to a higher volume of requests. To date, we have received 40 requests in both the Gaming and New Protocols and Ideas domains, 33 in Education & Community, and 28 in Nova and Developing Tooling. Additionally, around 15 more proposals were discussed directly with me, bypassing the Questbook application process, which indicates a potential for increased workload in this domain.
Another significant challenge, again related to the domain’s breadth, is the heterogeneity of the proposals. This diversity requires additional effort from the domain allocator to thoroughly assess each idea’s viability in terms of Product-Market Fit (PMF), competition, and demand.
Finally, there’s a specific challenge inherent to this program: advising protocols about navigating different grant programs. Although there’s no clear framework for cross-application, common sense dictates that a protocol shouldn’t apply for the same deliverable in more than one program. However, sometimes a different grant program may be more appropriate due to its maximum requestable amount or scope. It requires a thorough understanding of the available programs and how a protocol should apply to them, which I have been actively advising protocols on, encouraging them to pause their application in Questbook and consider alternative options when necessary.
On a somewhat related note, I am personally coordinating with members of the Arbitrum Foundation to develop a solution for this issue of cross-application.
Conclusion
We have currently approved $120,500 out of an initial budget of $200,000. Several proposals are still under evaluation and, if all are approved, they would technically consume the remaining budget. This assessment does not take into account the current fluctuations in the price of the $ARB token.
I am personally excited to see some of these proposals move forward. It will be interesting to observe their progress and to see if the outcomes align with the visions of the teams and myself.
Following the conclusion of the Domain Allocators grants program, as Cattin mentioned, I am committed to presenting a comprehensive report to the Arbitrum community. Additionally, I am looking forward to opening a discussion on how we can further enhance and improve this program.",90

We’d love to get feedback from the community here on the proposals that have been accepted, and any of the other proposals that have been posted on Questbook. Happy to clear any doubts about the program, or proposals, either from Questbook or the domain allocators.",92
15759,JoJo,2024-01-09 09:41:42,"Hello community,
I am reaching out on behalf of the Questbook Arbitrum grant committee to explore a possibility and get a temp check from delegates.
The current program, while financed and managed in ARB, provides grant and has operational cost denominated in USD. This has created a few ups and downs in our internal accounting, especially for one reason: grants that are approved now might take months to reach the milestone.
This has reflected as well in the whole timeline of the program: it started, in April 2023, with the request of $1M as a budget and ARB being worth around $1.20.
It got then approved the 6th of July 2023, when ARB was worth $1.13, as we can see from the Snapshot voting
The funds that were transferred from the foundation in the end were 800,000 ARB one month later, the 7th of August, worth at the time $908,000
As of now, the current remaining budget after 3 months of the program is of 583,823 ARB, worth, at current price of $1.76, around $1.03M.
At the same time, in the four domains, we committed overall $726,500 in future grants. We will also have a cost, for the next quarter, of around $92,500, between salaries and other expenses (like the KYC provider).
We want to explore the possibility to convert in stable 30% of the current ARB in the 5 safe, or around 175k. This will help us having more stability to ensure that the assigned grants will be indeed respected. We are looking to get the feedback from both the community and the delegates.
On the actual execution, assuming the general feedback regard the idea is positive, we have not yet established how the conversion would happen. The goal is, of course, to minimise any impact in the market. As of now, defillama is showing a slippage between 0.15 to 0.35% for a bulk 175K arb sale; It could make sense to either swap it in trances of around 50-60K each twap it in a certain amount of time.",93

Grant Amounts committed by domain ($) - $603k





 JoJo:

we committed overall $726,500 in future grants.


Is there any error in calculating the grant amount?
What is Questbook Arbitrum Grant Committee, is it passed by proposal? And does it comprise of Program Manager & 4 Domain Allocators only?",95
15759,JoJo,2024-01-10 10:21:57,"Yes, the right number is the one of Srijith. I have put the numbers together by just looking at the total, but in the end there are a few more in mines (either double applications, or applications that were approved but would not proceed with the grant and so on). So, the correct number is the one that is tracked by the PM.
On the grant committee of questbook: as you can see by the proposal linked in the first topic, is made by

A PM that oversees the program
4 different domain allocators, of which each one is responsible for a single domain.

15759,DisruptionJoe,2024-01-10 14:29:34,"Not only do I fully support, but I’d also share that we considered this as well. In discussion with the foundation, they have the ability to support our conversions. I’d recommend reaching out to @cliffton.eth",97
15759,dennison,2024-01-10 17:07:58,"This also sounds like a reasonable thing to do. No need to throw the grantees into insecurity via price fluctuation.
This does raise a question for me if in future grant funds should we fund in ARB? OR should we fund in USDC. At the moment the price movement has moved favorably for Questbook, but it could have easily (and could still) move aggressively against Questbook and other programs holding ARB.",98

15759,JoJo,2024-01-10 18:37:24,"This is an interesting consideration. And yes could have gone both ways, we were lucky in the end.
What you ask is more of a broader question.
It’s less important when the grant is related to incentivization (like in STIP for example), but still relevant.
Is way more important in grants in which the sum has to be spent for development, marketing and other expenses that are usually accounted in USD terms. Something to reflect for the future.",100
15759,Juandi,2024-01-22 00:16:31,"About the Delegated Developer Tooling Domain and TLDR
The Delegated Domain for Developer Tooling has focused on projects that empower developers, fostering a robust and accessible system with a two fold mission:


Fill crucial gaps: This includes essential infrastructure for network interaction, documentation for broad accessibility, and developer tools focused on tackling challenges like Layer-2 centralization, security, and user adoption.


Spark innovation and prepare developer-based products for sustainability, business models and venture funding: We have seen proposals for cutting edge applications drawing inspirations from established protocols, AI, and infrastructure that is ready to take a step forward in innovation. The Delegated Domain for Developer Tooling has also prepared grantees for pitch deck reviews, meetings with VCs and accelerators with 1:1 mentorship sessions, building a robust business model, and asking the hard questions that can make this project sustainable in the long run.


Based on proof from grantees and constant iteration with them we have had successful grantees who have been accepted to the Consensys Fellowship, secured interviews with OrangeDAO’s fellowship, and prepared fully-fledged pitch decks for a token or equity raise with web2 and web3 VCs.
Evaluation Rubric:
The proposals were polished during the first quarter of the grants program and have established a solid foundation on our four main evaluation rubrics:


Addressing developer and ecosystem needs: Demonstrate a clear understanding of the pain points experienced by Arbitrum Developers and propose solutions to directly address them.


Novelty and relevance: It has to be aligned with growth objectives and metrics based on demands for the following product.


Feasibility and clarity: An initial well-rounded plan with realistic milestones, concise and explanation and future aspirations for the project was critical for decision-making inside the diligence of the grants program.


Team expertise: Relevant experience and skills from the team or solo-founders was key in instilling confidence that the development of this grant and its continuation is in good hands.

Committed Funding
General description and what have they been up to?




Laika - Request builder for Web3
$12,500 USD
Postman for Web3. It works as a way to interact with Smart Contracts on the most friendly UI we have seen in possibly some time – combination of Remix, Postman and Etherscan ‘contract’ section. Laika has already finished the first milestone and is working on closing the scope for the grant. Previously the company has been incubated by accelerator programs and with an easy-to-grasp deck they are ready to head out and raise a successful pre-seed/seed round. Also enabled Laika to be open-source and pushed a PR from non-core Laika team and community for end-to-end testing.


Infrastructure Support for Arbitrum One and NOVA by ShapeShiftDAO
$13,000 USD
ShapeShift DAO proposed integrations in Frontend, Backend, Documentation and integration inside their Multichain Bridge (with an added value to bridge from Arbitrum to Bitcoin). ShapeShiftDAO has been the most fast-paced integration in the Delegated Developer Tooling Domain with already finishing the integration (including decentralized RPCs) on both Arbitrum One and NOVA. Currently Arbitrum One is already available with leading assets on its multi chain bridge and demo, while Arbitrum Nova has already been deployed in its testing environment.


Agnostic Account Abstraction Dev Tool for Arbitrum One and NOVA
$12,500 USD
This team has developed previous crypto companies and applications in Latin America. During an ETH Global Hackathon the team built account abstracted wallets to be onboarded on-top of WhatsApp. Similar to how TON enables wallets in Telegram – with the difference of a bigger and broader user-base. Team has already completed its first milestones integrating initial smart contracts and closing a deal with a WhatsApp business provider being MessageBird enabling them to onboard the wallets while following Meta’s strict policy on crypto products and services.


Bonadocs
$10,000 USD
Building a collaborative way to promote integration of smart contracts from different protocols. It started as a Postman for Web3 – similar to Laika. Later pivoting into a Google for Arbitrum Smart Contracts enabling the search and integration of smart contracts from distinguished protocols while enabling it to be read, deployed and simulated through a direct fork of Arbitrum One mainnet. We are pretty impressed by Bonadocs work in the last quarter, with its grant coming to a close and being accepted into the Consensys Fellowship opening the doors for up to $1.5M USD in funding from Consensys Mesh and participating in interviews for this cohort of the OrangeDAO fellowship. With the right mentoring, Bonadocs can easily reach a successful raise by Q2-Q3 2024 with significant growth metrics and adoption.


Bytekodes - AI Intent Layer for dApps
$11,000 USD
Bytekodes is leveraging AI to create an intent layer for Arbitrum. Imagine if ChatGPT could interact with the blockchain and you can send a prompt like ‘swap 20 USDC for DAI and supply it into Aave’. Bytekodes has successfully advanced into its final milestones while also polishing their pitch deck for a pre-seed raise and having interviews for the OrangeDAO fellowship. 


Espacio Cripto - Increasing Arbitrum’s Exposure to the LATAM Developer Community
$8,000 USD
Espacio Cripto is LATAMs HUB for all things crypto-related with a strong focus in governance, account abstraction and most recently Layer-2s. Abraham and Lalo both the founders of the community, have previously worked for unicorns like Bitso, platforms like Bueno and Payment Infrastructures like KillB. Espacio Cripto also has previously been supported by now members of the Arbitrum Foundation. While it has been our only DevRel approved grant proposal, Espacio Cripto will be used as a guideline and foundation for other DevRel proposals who might apply for the Delegated Developer Tooling Domain. For this grant proposal we have negotiated articles, reports of the meetups and on-chain attestations that includes how many developers were previously in the Layer-2 ecosystem and who are joining to start developing in the ecosystem. Some of the milestones Espacio Cripto has and why they are fit to lead the DevRel category in the Delegated Developer Tooling Domain: Espacio Cripto’s community grew significantly during the last months. Went from having 556 to 1,669 community members in Telegram 1 in the previous year, a growth of 295%. This is an active group with an engagement of more than 25% (readers and writers). Went from having 51 episodes to 225 as of November 3, 2023. It produced more than 250 hours of educational content. Has more than 115,000 downloads in the last year. According to its 2022 Spotify wrap, it was in the top 10 podcasts for +23,000 people, top 5 for 17,000 people, and top 1 for almost 6,000 people. According to Spotify, it was in the top technology podcast in Mexico for 198 days in 2022


DeFi Teller - Enhancing Arbitrum’s Ecosystem Analytics
$10,520 USD
DeFi Teller is building a Yelp for chains and protocols. With a ‘trust don’t verify’ principle the grant covers general fixes and enhancements for their website, database, analytics tooling and user reviews. The team is pretty well-versed with experience in technical background and previous editors in the journalism space. The integration covers support for One and Nova (TBA). Team has already updates pretty much all front-end bugs and enhanced data and parsing to capture metrics from relevant protocols in the Arbitrum Ecosystem.


JiffyScan: Block Explorer for Account Abstraction (EIP-4337) supporting Arbitrum One and Testnets
$13,000 USD
An Etherscan for Account Abstraction. Arbitrum One and Testnets (Sepolia and Goerli) have already been deployed. Aditya asked for this grant to cover for infrastructure and upscaling costs in a growth-based grant while he prepares JiffyScan for an enterprise pricing model and a seed round raise. First milestone has already been disbursed and completed. Waiting on his growth reports to disburse next grants.


Arbitrum Python SDK
$20,000 USD
Mert is developing a Python SDK for Arbitrum its a 1:1 replication of the current Arbitrum TypeScript SDK including Python native modules for asset bridging, mata entities, messaging, and utilities with the goal to enhance developer accessibility and integration capabilities within the Arbitrum Ecosystem. This proposal addresses a clear need for the ecosystem as Python is one of the most used programming languages. While old, it is still pretty relevant in consumer, business and enterprise ecosystems. Mert has previous experience building grant proposals of this scope and has stellar recommendations from grant programs like Aave, Filecoin and Polkadot.


Stylus VS Code Extension
$18,000 USD
Tolga is developing a Visual Code Extension for Stylus on Arbitrum. Offering a Project Management suite, enhanced coding experience and document for its VS store release. Tolga’s proposal addresses a clear need for the ecosystem as the talk of the town for developers has recently been Stylus. Projects and extensions like this help improve current developer experience, adoption and focus on providing more open-source commitment. The development of this extension was approved due to previous experience and recommendations from grant programs like Aave which have mentioned how great the experience working with him has been during its grant timeline.



Things to improve and conclusions:
The Delegated Developer Tooling Domain has been powering progress! We’ve seen a surge of high-impact projects, attracted exciting new proposals, and established a robust framework for growth. While a few overlaps surfaced from Questbook and our own programs, it’s a testament to the vibrant ecosystem blossoming on Arbitrum!
To build on this momentum, we’re excited to unveil two initiatives:


Streamlined Adoption & Expansion: We’re crafting a new RFP document and grant application template specifically for experienced teams building within the ecosystem. This will open doors for innovative use cases and proven business models, ensuring our funding reaches projects truly ready to make a splash.


Sustainable DevRel Support: We’re committed to nurturing long-term success, not just initial momentum. For DevRel proposals, we’ll explore attestation models for successful onboarded projects, workshops, and practices that empower them to flourish beyond grant cycles.


The future is bright in the Dev Tooling Domain! We’re thrilled by the horizon-expanding proposals emerging, from Chronicle Labs’ open-source oracles to Mountain Protocol’s RWA wrappers and Dhive’s governance HUB. These solutions hold immense potential to strengthen the Arbitrum’s growing DeFi ecosystem, transparency and engagement in Arbitrum’s governance-driven landscape.
On a personal note, our ambition is to witness one of these promising protocols secure venture funding or a successful token raise. Early-stage incubation programs like those thriving on other L2s, such as Celo’s Celo Camp, are crucial for our ecosystem’s growth, and that’s a goal we’re passionate about pursuing.
We’re energized by the possibilities ahead and eager to hear feed from the community. Onwards and upwards! ",101

15759,Blueweb,2024-01-24 18:08:11,"Sharing the observations about the Questbook Performance in the last quarter based on observation and interaction with builders. Thank you @krst for the review and encouragement.
I would like to make it clear that my intention in exploring the details of this program is solely to encourage potential enhancements through open discussion. I hold no negative feelings or animosity towards the Questbook team. I hope to witness them manage this program to the utmost standard.
Following are four pain points that if addressed can lead to better clarity and long-term success of the program.


No Rubrics developed for New Protocols & Ideas Domain.


If not using Rubric was mentioned anywhere is public, please ignore this point. I am currently not aware of that and expect it as part of the proposal says so.



Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook - Arbitrum DAO Grants

Each domain allocator is required to work alongside the program manager and come up with domain-specific rubrics similar to the following to evaluate the proposals. If the identified rubrics are not in line with the domain or Arbitrum’s roadmap, anyone from the community can openly suggest changes or question them on the forum





Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook - Arbitrum DAO Grants

As specified in our proposal, the elected domain allocators will run their domains independently in a transparent manner on Questbook. They will make independent decisions for their respective domains based on their evaluation rubric.


As mentioned in the proposals KPI & other discussions, rubrics were to be an important objective way of evaluating a project especially when approval is centralised.
These rubrics are missing for every project that got approved or rejected in the New Protocols & Ideas Domain.
Without using a rubric it is just a bureaucratic approach and not transparent.

Poor Turnaround Time(TAT) for two domains.





Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook - Arbitrum DAO Grants

Turnaround Time (TAT): We’ve maintained a communication TAT of less than 48 hours through the DDA model. Please find below some of the metrics related to CGP 2.0 which is being managed through the DDA model.





Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook - Arbitrum DAO Grants

In addition to maintaining a communication TAT of less than 48 hours, domain allocators assessed proposals using a domain-specific rubric in a transparent manner. This objective feedback provided builders with a clear understanding of the areas that needed improvement, allowing them to revise and resubmit their proposals based on actionable feedback.


Several projects have received their first comment from the domain allocator after a month.

First public comment:- 25 Nov, 2023
TAT:- 22 days
Final Status:- Approved
1402×314 29.6 KB
1402×314 28.2 KB
In the Arbitrum Education, Community Growth and Events domain the TAT was always 24-48 hours for the first public comment. In the Gaming Domain, the few proposals that I checked had a TAT of 1-5 days. No complaints about these domains.
In fact, how can this be achieved in all domains? Most Allocators have mentioned in their nomination form to be able to keep TAT by 48 hours but did not implement it. Even a TAT of 5-7 days should be fine.
Rationale:
First public comment can give a lot of confidence to new applicants that the process is agile. And most importantly, it was said to be done considering that the benefits are far better understood by QuestBook than anybody else.


Low Pay Out


1600×824 109 KB
The current total paid out is ~$150k.
Total Admin cost for the quarter is ~$90k.
Paid out ratio to admin cost looks very expensive. I understand these will be paid out in future but if the period of DDA’s is over how will the follow-up on milestones be ongoing?



Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook - Arbitrum DAO Grants

Program manager will share the status on milestone completion for each project


The above metric if provided will allow a better understanding of what needs to be addressed. For example, reaching out to the accepted teams to enable them to complete their milestone on time. Currently, there are no initiatives on those lines.


No Transparency





Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook - Arbitrum DAO Grants

Increased transparency: The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience.


For most projects, the communication happens off the Questbook, which defeats the purpose of using a platform. In many proposals the Accepted reason is mentioned as the conversation happened over the call in the last few weeks/months.
This can be improved further by keeping most questions public(even sharing a recording of the conversation over call) or hosting an open office hour which can be attended by any community member to increase transparency.
Personal Opinion
With the performance in the last quarter in each domain, I agree with the suggestion earlier made of having at least two DDA or two DDA’s for two Domains and the rubric of both should be above a set benchmark for approval.



Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook - Arbitrum DAO Grants

The DAO can decide whether they want one or two DDA for each domain via a poll.


The counter provided earlier for not having a multi-domain allocator was not seen in action.



Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook - Arbitrum DAO Grants

The decision-making has to be quick while being decentralized. The concept of choosing one domain allocator for the community is to strike the balance between speed and decentralization Having more than one DA for the same domain, increases the TAT - the current process ensures 48 hours of TAT. We also feared a potential friction between the domain allocators during a disagreement, hence we have a very clear distinction of the scope of the domains and the decisions of the domain allocators.


Having presented my observations, I strongly believe addressing these issues and accountability the QuestBook program can remain a vital part of ArbitrumDAO in the long run.",105
15759,Juandi,2024-01-24 18:39:40,"Hey Blueweb!
It’s great that you brought up proposals that had a high TAT. In the case provided through the “Let’s increase Arbitrum’s exposure to the LATAM dev community” we previously spoke with the Espacio Cripto’s team through channels that are able to get a faster response aka Telegram/WhatsApp. Espacio Cripto and Developer Tooling Domain’s conversation started since October 24th and through feedback of the initial application it got submitted on 3/11.
Through diligence and feedback from not only the domain but from members of the Foundation who helped us polish this proposal we later stepped back with Espacio Cripto to discuss about possible on-chain attestation to measure how many developers attend conferences related to this topic to provide better attestation with the community and governance. Eventually, modifying the budget, milestones and of course the final scope and metrics of the project.
For several projects extra due diligence is required as the delegated domain signs a grant to see if the scope is possible based on what have they currently built (repositories, pitch decks and overall assessment and follow-up questions).
I do appreciate the feedback and of course taking the time to ask the important questions about the future of this project. Still diligence is something that is done behind the scenes and sometimes requires certain tweaks to the proposal so we can review it and commit to accept it or reject it.
Taking your comments as solid feedback, and previously mentioned in our report we will add a new TAT in our new RFPs for different types of proposals depending on how complex the evaluation takes and to ensure better transparency we can start providing ‘minutes’ from the meetings and diligence calls so we are all up to date on how this proposal was reviewed and the evaluation criteria.
Any other questions please feel free to let us know.
Onwards!",107

 Blueweb:



No Rubrics developed for New Protocols & Ideas Domain.


If not using Rubric was mentioned anywhere is public, please ignore this point. I am currently not aware of that and expect it as part of the proposal says so.


All the evaluation has been done through the rubrics. What is actually lacking (and you are right on this) is me filling the platform, which is something I will do these next few days. Thanks for reporting it, and is right and fair to report everything in public as it should be in a program like this.
While all the motivation, for both approval and refusal, are always expressed in the comment of every proposal, the proper usage of the platform is indeed important.
Just for reference, my internal spreadsheet.

 Blueweb:

Domain:- Arbitrum New Protocols and Ideas
Submitted on:- 06 Nov, 2023
First Public Comment:- 06 Dec, 2023
TAT:- 30 days
Final Status:- Rejected


Ser, you sure you have all the information there? While that is actually the first comment in there, it does not imply that the first contact was that day. Matter of the fact, had the first contact with Abhilash few days later.
immagine1554×826 158 KB
Actually, while the application was rejected, we brainstormed a few good ideas, and we are still in contact so I can provide him my feedbacks, despite the application was rejected.
Oh, also, one of the reason why the application was rejected is that it came from the one of the Questbook member: since the idea needed some development (was initially thought to use options, i suggested to integrate perps which is what the team is working) and there was a possible conflict of interest, I decided to decline it after hearing from @Srijith-Questbook which gave me total freedom of choice.
Need to also add that, in general, more than half of the protocols contact me directly in telegram because my contacts are available in the google doc providing guidance in the program itself. They want to discuss, understand if they are a fit for the program, understand how to do the proposal, if their idea is correct and so on.
This also means that, sometimes, when a proposal is published, I have actually already spoke with the team (for a lot of time sometimes) and the lack of a public comment doesn’t mean that there was no contact.



 Blueweb:

The current total paid out is ~$150k.
Total Admin cost for the quarter is ~$90k.
Paid out ratio to admin cost looks very expensive. I understand these will be paid out in future but if the period of DDA’s is over how will the follow-up on milestones be ongoing?


the total current paid out should be (i say should cause I don’t have numbers at hand right now) 90,000$ plus another few K for the KYC provider, with the 90,000 being 3 months of salary for the group (5k for each domain allocator, 10k for the pm). It might have been for 4 months to so eventually is 120k. Again no numbers at hand.
What was paid, is not what has been approved tho. We are a program in which you first reach the milestone, then you get paid. As it should be.
So far, we have committed in the 4 domains around 675,000$ on top of the 150,000$ that was already paid. So, based on your ratio, is a 10% cost on top of the granted amount.
Seems good to me to be honest.



 Blueweb:

For most projects, the communication happens off the Questbook, which defeats the purpose of using a platform. In many proposals the Accepted reason is mentioned as the conversation happened over the call in the last few weeks/months.
This can be improved further by keeping most questions public(even sharing a recording of the conversation over call) or hosting an open office hour which can be attended by any community member to increase transparency.


So, you are saying I should provide the recording of the calls I have had with the protocols I spoke to, some of which are up to 5h each? I mean, yeah, is doable, but who is gonna hear them?
Also, do you REALLY think that a conversation can only happen through comments in a platform?
I ask projects to talk to me about their project, to show me their platform. How can this just be solved through text conversation?

Now, I obviously take full responsability for not filling up from the spreadsheet into the platform. It was an oversight on my side due to me not knowing the QB platform properly, and this will be fixed as I said. Thanks for pointing this out.
And please, if you have any other question, post it here, I am available for whatever discussio
Would just like to make just one question, since you posted the following, all for the sake of clarity of motivation of all parties in this discussion.



 Blueweb:

I would like to make it clear that my intention in exploring the details of this program is solely to encourage potential enhancements through open discussion. I hold no negative feelings or animosity towards the Questbook team. I hope to witness them manage this program to the utmost standard.


Can you confirm that you are indeed part of the WeathHedge team, that applied in my domain, and was refused, and that than contacted me again in dm to ask to rethink about my decision despite my feedback, public, in the application?
Just need an answer to this, and again this is just for the sake of clarity, so that everybody can see what are the potential motivations here for everybody.
immagine1394×742 111 KB

Now, as closing stance, a TLDR

I lacked in posting the reviews, for both approvals and denials, not only in the public comments of every proposal but also into the rubric section of the platform. This was an oversight on my part and will be rectified.
a lot of the stuff posted (delay in answer and others) don’t take in account how most of protocols just directly contact me through my public contacts that are published in the docs and template of the program in the questbook page. This means that, while there might be no public comment directly, there can be a contact. And, indeed, some protocols just jump the gun and contact me, several times, before publishing, to understand if their application would fit this program
would like to state something that should be obvious but apparently is not. As domain allocators, we are currently capped by 15h/week in our job. I can’t speak for my colleagues directly, but personally i tend to break the roof of this cap every week (pretty sure tbh it happens for them as well looking how much they work). Doesn’t mean anybody gets paid more for what it matters. But you also have to understand that, sometimes, we just need to back off some requests, and move them in the queue, because our allocation is limited and fixed in this program. This is one of the limitation that we want to address potentially for the future, and while everybody is committed to give as much time that is needed, sometimes we just need to respect this cap, to avoid being engaged by protocols that, understandly, just want to have a contact as fast as possible, have a proposal evaluated as fast as possible, provide corrections and documents and data as fast as possible, and iterate this process as fast as possible
please, if you can provide meaningful feedback on how the improve the current program, in my domain or in others, continue commenting here. While I am pretty sure there are several things to improve, I am getting a lot of positive feedback, both from protocols and external parties, and while these helps, also knowing what either doesn’t work or is just perceived as not working can help me and all the team make everything better.

I confirm that I was supporting the team for the project. Also, I was the one encouraging them to apply to QuestBook program, I am sure that is how we can grow the ecosystem.
I also learnt from them that they did not get to have any conversation or any rubrics shared which left them with real feedback on going back and improving on what they are trying to achieve.
To clarify on the dm part, It was encouraged by me to ask in public which they have on QuestBook which went unanswered and it was more of an appeal as the Rejection was awarded without a single conversation with the team.
Also, if you see the questions asked they are on what can be improved to not let such devs go away and see the transparency the program has to offer.",109
15759,JoJo,2024-01-24 20:25:43,"Ok, maybe we will indeed get somewhere with this conversation.
Let’s give the readers some context.
I gave a direct feedback, both in questbook and in DM, about the PMF of the product. Which is: PMF is not there, imo. Because, despite the growth, the amount of trades in weather future is totally minor in traditional finance market and thinking about bootstrapping that in crypto in which we don’t even have a proper unified framework for options is really really utopian.
Now, back to us. If you are telling me that is more convenient to give a feedback directly in relationship with the rubrics, this is something that we can discuss and work on.
In my feedback, I try to be crystal clear to explain what does work and what does not. I tend to not be too tied to formality, because I want to be able to communicate the bulk of the idea: usually, when a proposal does not work, it is mainly for a specific reason. Solving that reason, if possible, solves 80-90% of the problems. For this, I try to not attach myself to classification too much, but I try to be more direct in analyzing what does not work.
If the community, and especially the protocols, feels like the feedbacks are not clear enough, it is for sure possible be more “formal” in terms of rubric. I personally tho don’t think it would help protocol better understand where should they start working to improve their proposals tho. But is doable for sure.



 JoJo:

immagine1394×742 111 KB


In this answer I didn’t quote specifically the rubrics. I tried to be clear enough saying that 1) PMF for weather future is not there 2) PMF would be there for other asset classes.
I personally found strange that a team does not understand this answer. But I can also understand that others might not have the same viewpoint as me, so a different communication methodology might be needed.
For this, thanks, will reflect on what you posted.",110
15759,Flook,2024-01-24 20:35:29,"Questbook Gaming Domain Grant Program Report
Brief Domain Description
The Gaming Domain is focused on the broad web3 Gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum. With a heavy slant towards Indie Games, this domain is looking to fund games and projects that can bring both maximum short and long-term impact to this nascent industry. Additionally, discoverability and resources for developers and founders have been taken into account. Overall, the focus of this domain rests on filling an underserved niche for indie developers and studios building novel and promising projects in the web3 gaming space.
Short Term Expectations
Short term impact for gaming grants should be adequately contextualized with a few facts from the web2 indie game development space.

Average time to develop an indie game: ~1 to 3 Years
Average funds needed: $50,000 - $10,000,000
‘Success’ rate of indie game studios: 7% generate enough revenue to create a second game

With these statistics in mind, showing short term impact in the gaming vertical will be tough, though not impossible. As the domain allocator i’ve focused on games with working demos, or alphas, in an effort to show maximum impact within a 6 month period, ushering these games towards some aspect of launch before the end of March. This leads me to…
Long Term Expectations
My personal hope for this grant program has been to engender an innovative and inclusive culture of indie gaming on Arbitrum to put our best foot forward while onboarding the next decade of Arbitrum Gaming developers and studios.
The developers and studios building in this space today can serve as a vanguard for the nascent web3 gaming industry, proving out concepts and experimenting with new technology. While not every grantee in this program will see success, the overall impact will be a net positive for the Arbitrum gaming space as well as the Arbitrum DAO and should return many multiples on the ARB invested on a long enough timeframe.

3 Milestones - Gold Inc. Mobile MMORTS
$7,500 disbursed
Gold Inc. is a forward thinking mobile-first game built by a studio with previous mobile game success. The addition of blockchain elements built on top of Arbitrum situate Gold Inc. in a good position to grow the pie of gaming with novel monetization methods. The expansion from Polygon to Arbitrum should hopefully bring new users from outside the ecosystem to Arbitrum.


Frags


A Xonotic mod purpose-built for FPS tournaments on Arbitrum-themed maps.
$5,000 Allocated
2 Milestones - FPS: ""Frags""
$4,000 disbursed

Kaiju Cards is a shining example of an indie game that has found early success in the Web3 gaming market. It’s re-playability and focus on depth of gameplay combined with it’s strong IP and quick development speed make it a great fit for this program. Arbitrum as the base layer for all of it’s on-chain economy components is an easy choice. I expect high impact alongside their future launches.


Gaming Chronicles


A gaming community focused on web3 gaming with +1,500 members on discord and +8,000 subscribers on substack.
$3,300 Allocated
1 Milestone - Gaming Chronicles
$3,300 disbursed
More distribution and UA channels need to be set in place for gaming on Arbitrum. Led by Raiden, a familiar face in the broader Web3 gaming ecosystem, this community will do a lot to drive new users to Arbitrum games. I expect quick turnaround impact here, with much room for growth to larger grants focused in similar areas.



Spire

3 Milestones - ҽ𝐒: 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐈𝐝𝐥𝐞 𝐌𝐌𝐎𝐑𝐏𝐆
$7,500 disbursed
A unique take on the Idle gaming genre with a web2 first mentality as opposed to the many web3 native idle games seems high risk yet high reward. Games such as Melvor Idle have strong player bases and a game like Ether Source could look to form a strong core community with which to build out their larger vision. The earliest-stage game funded through the program, yet the one with the quickest GTM based on the limited amount of development needed for their MVP.


Land, Labor and Capital (LLC)


An onchain tycoon game where players are in true control of their economy and their creativity.
$18,000
3 Milestones - Land, Labor and Capitol (LLC) - onchain tycoon game
$6,000 disbursed
LLC’s novel approach to onchain games through the use of AI generated assets, combined with their close partnership with Leonardo AI helps them stand out from the crowd. Economy-centric onchain gaming is a strong niche to explore in Web3 as it caters to the current hardcore crowd of existing Web3 gamers. Finally, the teams strong background in both game development and crypto protocols places them at an important intersection to drive the success of their project.


Gaming Startup Collective


Event sponsorship for a burgeoning community of Web3 gaming Founders.
$6,900 allocated
3 Milestones - Sponsorship of the Gaming Startup Collective's Monthly Calendar of Events
$4,600 disbursed

An emerging game discovery community dedicated to creating a welcoming and enjoyable environment for gamers to explore new Web3 games.
$3,500 Funding Allocated
1 Milestone - Waypoint Gaming - Game Night Grant
$3,500 disbursed
More game discoverability is always a need within gaming ecosystems, especially for the burgeoning Arbitrum Gaming eco. Gaming communities and guilds like Spike’s Waypoint Gaming offer a unique opportunity to go to the heart of where Web3 gamers reside to onboard them directly. This should be seen as a quick impact, temperature taking exercise in which we can evaluate the results in order to allocate more capital to these sorts of communities in return for their assistance in User Acquisition.

$15,000 Allocated
4 Milestones - Fair Gaming ecosystem
$0 disbursed
A gaming platform focused on the degen side of gambling and wagering mechanics, Fair Protocol seems like a solid fit for the current Web3 gaming audience. Fair Protocol aims to develop a more robust core PvP game that serves as a base layer for wagers made in cryptocurrency. This sort of setup can only be done transparently with blockchain and therefore is a good use case for this grant.


WorldWarDAO : On-Chain Idle-RPG Game.


An onchain Idle RPG focused on innovative onchain mechanics and a unique meme-based take on the genre.
$15,000 Allocated
3 Milestones - WorldWarDAO : On-Chain Idle-RPG Game.
$5,000 disbursed
Onchain gaming has a lot of room for growth, especially in the Arbitrum ecosystem. By funding onchain games in different genres we can look for early success that will lead to more development in this nascent industry flowing to Arbitrum. World War DAO’s meme take on the genre should attract an initial user base, which is one of the largest hurdles in gaming.

My point is just that, Rejection is part of their journey but we don’t want them to feel it was subjective.
Perhaps, the rubrics sheet of yours being pushed into QuestBook will make the process more transparent to all grant seekers.



 JoJo:

As domain allocators, we are currently capped by 15h/week in our job


I know we have very few individuals willing to spend their time and keep the community afloat and your contribution to that is unmatched. I have seen you active around many calls and in the forum, which cannot allow me to question the hours spent by you or any other Domain Allocator.
The conversation is just about making things look the same on the platform, perhaps by acknowledging with a comment or changing the status to “In Review”, which can reflect faster TAT to new applicants in the future.  I believe this will encourage more projects to approach QuestBook over time.",112
15759,JoJo,2024-01-24 20:57:50,"We are definitely getting somewhere here.
You are right in subjectivity vs objectivity, a straighforward judgment might sometimes be taken as subjective. I don’t think it was the case in the example above, still the general point stands.
We can for sure improve the overall perception protocol sides on how stuff is reviewed and we will work on this point. Thanks for the feedback ",113

As seen in the table, the total amount committed corresponds to $199,274.00, which is very close to the $200k allocated to each domain, as stated in the original Domain Allocator by Questbook proposal.
At the time of writing this report, of the $199,274.00 committed, only $48,950.00 has been distributed, meaning the domain still needs to distribute $150,324.00.

This map represents an approximation of the regions and countries to which the approved projects belong, demonstrating the regional diversity on which the domain is focused, as explained in our vision and criteria for grants
As we said in our previous report, please let us know if you think there are errors in this map, we’re open to feedback.
Our experience as Domain Allocators
While being domain allocators, we came across certain situations that we would like to discuss with the community, as we believe that they can add value to the program’s performance.
Budget swap
The original questbook proposal stated that each domain would have to distribute $200k to projects during the experimental program, however the amounts expressed in the proposal were in stables, while, during the program, the payments were made using the ARB token.
The price of the token moved up significantly during much of December and early January, so there was no reason to stop using the ARB token as the primary asset for distributing grants.
However, due to market volatility and concern that the price of the ARB token would collapse lower than 1$, a decision was made together with all domain allocators, to convert the entire committed amount to stable currency in order to ensure that approved projects would receive enough funding during the program.
This decision was shared in the forum by jojo to receive the feedback from the community members and other
Project collaboration case
We experienced a very interesting case where we had 3 proposals that offered a similar concept , these project were:

Arbitrum University
The Arbinauts Hub: 2 video-courses + Website + Growth: X, newsletter and podcast
Atoma Project (This one was used to create the final proposal)

After an internal discussion between our team and project members, where we checked all 3 project ideas, we suggested to the team leaders that the 3 teams could support each other in order to create just one strong proposal. This was only a suggestion, the team leaders always made the final decision.
It is important to mention that during this process, the Arbitrum Foundation has contributed to making this collaboration possible. We believe that it would be beneficial for the Arbitrum Foundation to formally establish a direct line to the domain allocator program to cover all projects. This would not only provide greater exposure for such projects, but would also significantly increase interest in Arbitrum, thus attracting more builders. We cannot underestimate the importance of establishing these direct lines of communication with the Arbitrum Foundation in this process, as we believe that actions such as this are useful to maximize the impact of these initiatives in the ecosystem and build confidence not only in the grants recipients but also in the community members.
These team leaders had a couple of meetings and finally they reached us to communicate that they will be collaborating to create just 1 proposal named “Atoma Project + Arbinauts + Cryptoversidad Collaboration”
Domain allocators collaboration
Internally, the domain allocators along with the program manager have a telegram group that is used to communicate feedback about the program and interaction between each domain member.
As expressed by Danielo in his post, in some cases a proposal can cover 2 or even more domains at the same time. This happened to us several times and we had internal conversations with other domain allocators to determine on which domain it was appropriate for the applicant to submit their proposal.
Large amount of High level proposal
As we pointed out in our last report, our role as domain allocator posed a significant challenge in managing a considerable volume of high-level proposals. In consequence, we spent considerable time meticulously reviewing each project idea and budget, resulting in a complex selection process. However, guided by our vision and criteria, our main objective remained to ensure the selection of projects with the highest quality and the most favorable value. This also gave us an indication that the funds allocated to the domain were not sufficient as we would have been able to cover more high-level applications.
Regional Diversity
During the process, we received numerous proposals from various countries and regions, which gave us great satisfaction. However, it also meant additional work. Each region had its own pricing rates, which required a concerted effort on our part to align these prices with domain costs. We tried to maintain regional diversity (as shown on the map), we believe this is beneficial for Arbitrum.
Things to improve
After the whole process we faced as domain allocators, we recollected recommendations based on our experience and perspective from other programs.
Addition of the program parameters
Through the process, we realized that we needed to clarify the maximum amount per proposal (25k) repeatedly along with the deadline of the domain allocator program. We believe these simple parameters should be visible directly from the website UI, just like the parameters that already show on the website.
KYC and Agreement Statement
One person from each approved project must complete a KYC process along with an Agreement before the release of any funds. We think that this process should be mentioned to make it clear to all proposers from the beginning. This will optimize the time process. Additionally, the KYC link + documents could also be provided in a more automated way, i.e. simply sending them the KYC link to their email upon approval + the agreement once they pass KYC.
Website Improvement
After using the Questbook site for a time, we realized that some parts of the website can be improved or added, for example allowing editing or removal of comments, increasing the character limit for rubrics (currently 300 characters which is often not enough to justify how we assign scores) or the support of hyperlinks. With these little modifications, we think that the website will be more comfortable to use.
Questbook is a very good platform for grants, it is transparent, but we believe it can be improved in case the DAO wishes to continue with the program in the future, which we believe benefits the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Program Funding
We recommend optimizing program funding by using stablecoins from the beginning of the program. This strategic approach eliminates concerns related to token fluctuations, providing a clearer path for budget analysis and accounting. This, in turn, reduces the risk of miscalculations. Another alternative would be to fund the program in ARB and simply immediately turn funds into stables upon approval of a program (unless they choose to get paid in ARB).
Diffusion to approved projects
At the end of the day, all approved projects will add value to the arbitrum ecosystem, so we believe it is very important to support these projects to give them enough diffusion to all ecosystem members. We believe this can be done with the support of the Arbitrum Foundation.
Conclusions
In this report on the Education, Community Growth and Events Domain, we have provided details about the distribution of funds, along with our experience as domain allocators, and made recommendations to improve the program performance.
From our side, we’re committed to optimizing our processes and collaborating with the community to ensure the success and sustainability of the domain allocator program. We welcome your feedback and look forward to implementing these recommendations for continuous improvement.
As we said in our first report, we are committed to presenting a comprehensive final report to the Arbitrum community when the Domain Allocators grants program concludes.",115
15759,iamoracle,2024-01-31 05:24:04,"Thank you @cattin for the great report.
I love how you considered regional diversity, and I strongly believe that this could accelerate growth worldwide rather than in a particular place.
Lastly, the QuestBook team should work on their comment section UI/UX. It has been preventing us from posting images. Thank you once again.",116
15759,ArbitrumGovernance,2024-01-31 18:47:39,"FEEDBACK FROM @ARBITRUMGOVERNANCE PROJECT
Hi,
As we have finished the development of Arbitrum Governance and deployed the final version on Twitter (https://twitter.com/arbigovernance), our team would like to thank @JoJo for his exceptional leadership and support throughout our project’s development within the program. JoJo’s guidance has been instrumental in helping our team at Build3rs Labs as he helped transition our initial project to focus on governance.
During a collaborative call, JoJo suggested shifting our initial project to Arbitrum Governance, his understanding of the Arbitrum ecosystem helped us recognize the potential impact and relevance of this shift, and we started working immediately after that.
I also wanted to mention that working through Questbook has been incredible for our team, we have been through grant programs before (more than 20 in total) but we never had a smooth experience like this while building. The platform provided a structured framework for project development, we could access the status of our proposal in real time, see the feedbacks and easily get the fundind once a milestone is completed. This is something really important for us developers.
We successfully deployed the Arbitrum Governance Tracker on both Telegram and Twitter, providing community members with real-time data into governance proposals, discussions and voting activities. During this entire time of development, JoJo was there to test our work with us and provide ideas which we integrated immediately.
So yes, working through Questbook under JoJo’s mentorship has been really different of what we’re used to, in a completely positive way. If you want to expand your ecosystem and bring more projects in, this is the way to do it. We are looking forward to build for Arbitrum again, as this experience was amazing.",117
15759,justmert,2024-02-01 13:55:37,"I have worked as grantee with more than 20 projects with various protocols and recently I have received a grant from Arbitrum with project Arbitrum Python SDK.
I must say I that @Juandi is the best evaluator and reviewer of the grants. He is very fast in responding, evaluates projects logically while taking into account of the funding.
He has supported me when I need help, and the whole grant process was so smooth. Thank you @Juandi for being best domain allocator   Also thanks for @Srijith-Questbook for their work.",118
15759,SnF_NFT-Fi_Leo,2024-02-01 23:03:59,"I would like to provide feedback on behalf of the Sweep n’ Flip team, which was approved for the Questbook Grants.
Jojo managed the grant procedure with exceptional professionalism and transparency, a process that was both meticulous and initiated through the completion of the Questbook. This tool provided a clear and well-guided template for submission, ensuring an organized approach from the start.
Following the initial application, further engagement through the Questbook’s transparent chat facilitated open communication. This was complemented by a personal video interview, which offered an opportunity to delve deeper into our team’s dynamics, intentions, capabilities, and interests. It also served to strengthen relationships through direct interaction.
Throughout the process, all communications and updates were consistently posted in the Questbook chat. This practice maintained a level of transparency that allowed the entire DAO community to follow the allocation and utilization of their resources closely.
The Questbook model, in particular, is of significant importance to the DAO. It enables swifter decision-making and support for smaller teams with reduced bureaucracy and time expenditure, all while upholding the necessary transparency and due diligence.",119
15759,aidenaziz,2024-02-05 21:54:31,"Hello Friends,
I wanted to take a moment to share my experience with the Arbitrum Grant Program with our project “Smart Contract and Address Labeling System for Arbitrum One” and the guidance provided by the program coordinators.
The grant program’s structured approach, from proposal submission to milestone tracking, was very clear and efficient and enabled us to focus on development without much overhead.
The coordinators, especially our main contact, JoJo, was incredibly responsive, providing timely feedback and constructive suggestions and was keen to help us refine our proposal by reviewing and pinpointing areas we needed to elaborate more and explain more in depth, ensuring our objectives were communicated effectively and comprehensively.
JoJo’s dedication to fostering innovation and projects building on top of Arbitrum as well as his support for teams embarking on this journey has been evident throughout the process. We are thankful for this valuable opportunity and are excited about our continued involvement in enriching the Arbitrum ecosystem.",120

15759,JoJo,2024-02-16 20:49:08,"Report N°2: Arbitrum New Protocols and Ideas Domain
This report describes the development of the Arbitrum New Protocols and Ideas domain, up until the current date, the 16th of February, and is a continuation of Report 1. I have been currently leading the domain alone, and in this report I will cover all the applications and what has been achieved up to this point.
Note: the program is not currently complete and there is a leftover in the safe, currently both being allocated in one or more project and if possible shared with other domains, due to the increase of price of the $ARB token.
Domain Overview

Number of proposals: 51
Number of proposals accepted: 16 (one is a typo that got resubmitted)
Funding Allocated: 264.000$
Number of milestones in total of all accepted projects: 43
Milestones completed: 7
Funding Disbursed: 65,000$

Proposal categorization
As of the 16th of February, this is a classification of all the submitted proposals.
image1204×742 33.9 KB
Similar to Report 1, DeFi is the most prominent category. What is interesting, tho, is that the classification has even out with the category of Infrastructure and NFT. It shows how builders, especially smaller ones (which are the main TAM of the Questbook program), are targeting NFT projects that are seen as opportunities for both the community and for new ventures.
This is the sub-categorization breakdown of the DeFi, Infrastructure and NFT proposals.
image1198×738 33.6 KB
There is no change compared to Report 1: Derivative is still the most important subcategory.
image1190×736 38.5 KB
The same applies for the subcategory of Infrastructure. It has to be noted tho that the amount of applications, increased in the second part of the program, have for sure helped in diversifying this sector. The same consideration of Report 1 can apply here.
image1182×736 32.3 KB
NFT is now a new, main category analyzed that was not available in Report 1 due to the lower presence. We can see the focus in Deployment and Gaming.
For for the former, it can indicate how teams are indeed looking to build tools for ohter builders and users, such that they will be able to deploy NFT collections with no coding experience. This can be read as the willingness from the public to also experiment with specific utility of the NFT beside the classic PFP usage.
The latter, Gaming, is one of the category that is the most established for NFT alongside PFP. A lot of protocols wants to build services and tools on top of gaming NFT, showing how the landscape for this category is evolving over time in term of the creation of pick & shovels.
Proposals Accepted
The following is a list of all the accepted projects, on top of the one already shown in Report 1, with a summary of the proposal and related details.
Giveth

Giveth wants to enhance its donation platform by integrating the Arbitrum network and incentivizing its use through a sponsored Quadratic Funding (QF) round. This initiative aims to widen fundraising capabilities for verified public goods projects and attract more users to Arbitrum. With $5,000 allocated for the integration process and an additional $2,500 for running the QF round, Giveth plans to require all participating projects to have an Arbitrum address, thereby promoting Arbitrum adoption. The integration will allow donations in ARB and spotlight Arbitrum through marketing efforts.**
Funding allocated: 7,500$
Milestones: Front-end and back-end development and user interface improvements needed for network integration. Milestone should be paid once ARB can be donated to projects on Giveth (5,000$), Run an Arbitrum sponsored QF Round. We will migrate $25,000, or more, of our donation.eth Matching Pool if we can gather Arbitrum related sponsors. Milestone should be paid once we have $20,000 (or more) in donation.eth’s Safe on Arbitrum (2,500$).
Funding disbursed: 0$
The proposal, developed in collaboration with Griff, was justified by the potential to open up new opportunities for projects through mechanisms not available in existing grant programs, aligning with objectives of developing infrastructure, expanding or migrating protocols/products to Arbitrum, and benefiting from the team’s proven experience. Supporting Giveth’s expansion on Arbitrum was seen as a net positive for the community and the blockchain ecosystem.

Address labeling - walletlabels.xyz

The proposal outlines a project aimed at addressing the challenge of non-standardized and anonymous contracts and accounts on the Arbitrum One chain by developing a smart contract labeling system. This system will utilize both manual community-driven contributions and advanced automatic labeling to provide comprehensive and standardized datasets for labeling already deployed smart contracts and accounts on Arbitrum. The approach combines a manual labeling engine, where community members can contribute labels, with an automatic labeling engine that employs heuristic algorithms and machine learning to improve labeling accuracy. This dual approach aims to create a reliable database of smart contracts and account labels, enhancing the user experience across the Arbitrum ecosystem.
The project’s deliverables include a user-friendly platform for label contributions, real-time scanning for up-to-date labeling, and a comprehensive range of labels for various entities such as exchanges, protocols, and bots. The datasets will be freely accessible to users and developers, with an API endpoint provided for integration with applications built on top of Arbitrum One.
The long-term vision includes transitioning to a decentralized model, opening up access to other contributors, and creating an economic model that balances open-source ethos with business viability. The proposal outlines additional milestones for platform development and public launch, with a total estimated completion time of 10 weeks.
Funding allocated: 23,700$
Milestones: Labeling Engines and Frontend Interface (8,000$), Platform Development (API Endpoints and Contributor Dashboard) (8,000$), Public launch (7,700$).
Funding disbursed: 0$
Address labeling and data enrichment services are not entirely new concepts, but there’s currently no comprehensive solution in Arbitrum. The project is positioned as a public good, with plans to eventually allow third parties to contribute data, creating a self-sustaining model that could serve the community. This innovative approach merits support, as it could significantly benefit the ecosystem. Moreover, the development of a wallet address data enrichment solution could be just the beginning, potentially attracting interest from larger entities in the crypto space.

Hunt NFT

Hunt NFT is a cross-chain raffle marketplace that enables trading of NFTs across various blockchains, including Ethereum and Arbitrum, allowing participants to buy chances to win NFTs. The platform supports five blockchains and plans to include BTC Ordinals NFTs, with Arbitrum as the main bridge.
The team is focused on expanding Hunt NFT’s capabilities to include NFT bridges between Arbitrum and EVM chains, support for Bitcoin NFTs through a centralized bridge, and the integration of Bitcoin inscription for BRC20 inscribed assets.
Funding allocated: 7,500$
Milestones: support nft bridge arb <—> evm chains (4,500$), support bitcoin NFT (bridge to evm & raffle bitcoin NFTs) (2,000$), support bitcoin BRC20 inscriptions (bridge to evm & raffle BRC20 inscriptions) (1,000$).
Funding disbursed: 0$
The recognition that the NFT market in Arbitrum is underserved means there is the need for more infrastructure development in this area. Similarly, the growing narrative around Bitcoin inscriptions/NFTs underscores the importance of building native bridges not just for Bitcoin but for other types of assets as well. Given the project’s thematic, NFT, the utility, bridging, and the raffle system, it was worth to support it in the program.

Mystic - enabling whitelabel NFT economies on Arbitrum

Mystic offers whitelabel solutions and APIs aimed at empowering games, artists, and NFT-based projects to build and monetize their own economies. Recognizing the challenge creators face in monetizing transactions due to external marketplaces often not enforcing royalties, Mystic simplifies the creation and maintenance of a trading infrastructure. This enables creators to control transactions, enforce royalties, and facilitate buying, selling, exchanging, and renting of NFTs cost-effectively. Built by the team behind Mysticswap, Mystic plans to expand its services to the Arbitrum ecosystem, enhancing the platform with features like loyalty mechanics, a whitelabel NFTfi protocol, and a website builder to become the ""Shopify for NFT marketplaces.
Funding allocated: 13,260$
Milestones: Arbitrum Deployment (4,260$), Growth and Ecosystem Adoption (9,000$)
Funding disbursed: 0$
The system is what I would define as a pick & shovel type of system, enabling tooling for NFT exchanges under some centralized rules (like royalty enforcement). The fact that there is an SDK that allows third parties to integrate the solution, for example, in their games, is quite important in my opinion.

Buddyguard

Buddy-Guard is a social safeguard dApp, coupled with an attachable NFC wristband, conceptualized to enhance safety at in-person events. Launched in November 2023 and recognized as a finalist at ETH Global Istanbul, Buddy-Guard aims to address safety concerns by facilitating the creation of safety-guard groups through a simple tap of an NFC-enabled wristband. This wristband, storing the user’s private key, integrates seamlessly with a social app, allowing event attendees to easily connect and monitor each other’s safety. The project was born out of a real-world need identified by its co-founders during their stay in Istanbul for a series of Web3 events. By leveraging NFC technology and blockchain, Buddy-Guard not only aims to make post-event socializing safer but also introduces a privacy-preserving, in-real-life social application. The application incorporates a reputation and attestation system, incentivizes trust within safety groups using cryptocurrencies like ARB, USDC, or USDT, and plans to integrate a decentralized identity protocol to further enhance user security and privacy.
Funding allocated: 22,500$
Milestones: MVP development - Deployed in Arbitrum testnet, MVP → React Native application/test demo video, Log In with WaltID/Arbitrum account, Group creation, Adding/removing Buddy-Guard, SOS message sharing, Reputation system (11,000$), Alpha Testing- Functional wristband prototype, Test application with 30 individual users, New features → Safety tracking, GPS Map Group Members, Hangout Feature (=Event matching) (7,500$), Beta Testing - Test application with 200 users, 10 buddy-guard group created, 10 hangout events set up (4,000$)
Funding disbursed: 0$
This protocol is quite particular, and initially I was conflicted. The team showed capabilities and this is why they were able to win a few hackathons, so technicals are there for sure. But I thought that the connection with web3 was weak: everything was doable with web2 infra, by eventually using apple pay or samsung pay instead of the staking for the slashing penalty, and the usage of crypto, except maybe for making the PII (Personally Identifiable Information) truly unaccessible.
This is why I suggested the team to look into identity protocols: it was always natural to be able to share your own information through other protocols that are already live and solving this problem in arbitrum. The team took the matter in their hand, scouted several protocols which were then presented to me, and together we assessed the best to be integrated based on several characteristics, not only technicals but also culturals.
I am very happy the team was flexible enough to deviate a bit from their initial plan, because the current iteration of the product is way more complete in my opinion.
Would like to finally add a remark on one of the expenses, the “traveling” ones. While from the outside these could look like an unnecessary overspending, it’s actually needed in this case to test the product on the field, with different people and different needs, and gather feedback.

Unitap

Unitap is designed to streamline the onboarding process for new users into web3 ecosystems, addressing the challenge of educating newcomers and preventing exploitation by bots and airdrop farmers. It offers a blend of educational content, simple and free onboarding, rewards, and Sybil-resistant mechanisms to ensure rewards go to real users. Unitap provides four main services: Learn Tap for web3 education, Gas Tap for free gas tokens to start on various networks, Token Tap for distributing tokens with specific requirements, and Prize Tap for raffle creation. Unitap aims to expand on Arbitrum, incentivizing new users and engaging DAO members in governance through reward programs. The team behind Unitap has good experience in web3 and previous contributions to projects like BrightID.
Funding allocated: 25,000$
Milestones: Improvements and Deployment of the Token & Prize Taps in Arbitrum One (11,000$), Launch an Arbitrum Onboarding incentive program for the next 1000 new Arbitrum unique users that bridge at least $25 to Arbitrum One. These funds will be passed to end users (2,500$), Launch an Arbitrum Governance incentive program through five raffles with a $500 prize in each raffle. These funds will be passed to end users (2,500$), Finalize the development of the dashboard provider to allow anyone to create Incentive programs and Raffles in a permissionless way (9,000)
Funding disbursed: 0$
The proposal is quite unique in the value that it wants to bring: a multi modular dApp that will, among others, allow users to claim gas tokens, incentivise small holders to vote and participate in governance, allow third parties to build their own incentivisation program and create a raffle system. Quite unique indeed. I like a lot especially the spin of governance, in a chain like arbitrum that is so vibrant in this sense. Beside this, the team has been behind this application for a lot of time showing commitment, and they have a broader vision that makes it worthwhile to finance their efforts.

Scattering

Scattering is a project designed to improve the liquidity of NFT trading on Arbitrum by allowing users to instantly trade NFTs much like ERC-20 tokens. It introduces a system where users can deposit their NFTs into a Safebox, receiving in return sTokens, linked to the NFT’s floor price, and a Key, representing its unique value. This setup divides NFT trading into two markets: one for the general value on Uniswap V3 and another for unique value via auctions.
The project plans to support major ERC721 and ERC404 NFT collections on Arbitrum and aims to facilitate cross-chain transfers for top ERC404 collections from the Ethereum mainnet.
Funding allocated: 20,000$
Milestones: ERC 404 Marketplace by Combining ERC404 Token Trading and ERC404 NFT Trading in One Portal on Arbitrum (10,000$), Advanced Functionalities and Growth of Adoptions (10,000$).
Funding disbursed: 0$
The idea of tokenizing NFT is not novel, but the approach taken here has some novelty indeed: separating the floor value of the token from the specific value, either aesthetically or in terms of traits. It’s indeed a very cool experiment to see, because one of the issues of NFTfi is that, so far, it could only be applied to floor NFT, unless the protocol (like jpegd) introduces a multiplier for traits. But this solution, the multiplier for traits, needs to be manually curated by an analyst, updated over time based on the market, it can only be applied to very liquid and traded collections, thus being an unscalable option for more generalistic protocols.
This introduction, paired with the intent of furtherly experimentation with ERC404 tokens, place Scattering in almost an R&D category in my opinion, and this is (also) why it’s worth exploring all of the above.

AMLOK

AMLOK aims to solve on Arbitrum how entities can raise funds by introducing a blockchain-based liquidity solution. This solution is designed to ease the liquidity provisioning mechanism faced by web3 projects, which often struggle due to complex or inefficient funding mechanisms. AMLOK’s white-label tool will enable projects to launch customized funding campaigns, offering fractionalized investments and NFT-based rewards to backers, thereby enhancing user engagement.
The project plans to migrate its current platform from Polygon to Arbitrum and expand its services to cater to the web3 sector, facilitating fund raises in both USDC and FIAT. The key deliverable is a platform that allows for transparent investment campaigns and provides backers with fractionalized investment options and NFT rewards. The team aims to complete this within six months.
Funding allocated: 24,560$
Milestones: Releasing AMLOK on Arbitrum (14,000$), Pilot Launch and Market Validation (6,500$), Integration of On-Ramp (4,600$).
Funding disbursed: 14,000$
With the Amlok team the biggest hurdle was to find the right milestones for a product that is mostly aimed to offchain activity, and that uses crypto as a way to reduce friction in already existing use cases in the world.
One of the thing i was very happy to see was the professionality and experience of the team: they were able to properly address not only the characteristics of their product, but also the compliance side of it and in general the approach in showing why their idea has value. Top notch team/approach, something you want regardless of you building a web3 app or a fridge.
Idea per se is good but not totally novel: you could simplify it as a funding platform putting together blockchain and more classic IRL mechanics. What I really like is the way the team is approaching the problem, in a very value oriented and professional way. So the idea, while being relatively “simple” (no offense for anybody, I love simple ideas), could have amplification just because of the team approach to it.
Note: for this project, milestone 1 was paid upfront. This is because the funds are effectively needed for the team to operate. While this is a (small) risk for the program, the professionality of the team and the amount is such that is a risk worth taking, especially because it is needed for the application to move forward.

Conclusion
Thanks to the growth of $ARB, starting from an initial budget of less than 180,000$, we managed to allocate more than 250,000$ for severak protocols.
We are going toward the natural end of this program, and the numbers above (proposal approved in particular) could be an indication of what comes next in a future iteration.
I really like how a lot of these protocols are, indeed, “smaller” dApp that are niche enough to not be able to access higher fund routes, but also important enough that users will be indeed able to exploit the value of their idea.
Because of this, I am personally proud of what we achieved, and the builders we have helped: I don’t know how many of these would have been able to get to their personal finish line on their own, my educated guess is “some” of them due to how hungry these teams are.
Despite this, having the breathing room of knowing that some costs are covered can really help you focus on what you want to do most: build.
One that that is clear is the following: protocols tend to ask for the maximum amount possible.
And, if I can be honest, there is nothing wrong with that: in their shoes (and I have been there and I am already there) I would do the same, where same is trying to get the most out of a very positive opportunity.
Why am I writing this? Because is an important statistic to take in account for a next iteration of this program, or in general for any development grant program, in term of rules vs behaviour of grantees. Food for thoughts.
As stated in Report 1, I am looking forward to opening a discussion on how we can further enhance and improve this program.",123
21143,krst,2024-02-08 00:31:50,"The below response reflects the views of L2BEAT’s governance team, composed of @krst and @Sinkas, and it’s based on the combined research, fact-checking and ideation of the two.
As mentioned on several occasions already, we would like to raise delegates attention to the Delegate Domain Allocator Grants program run by Questbook (as voted in that proposal).
Although this grant program was officially launched on 5th October, 2023 and should theoretically end sometime around April (it was originally scheduled to last 6 months), we can already consider it completed in the sense that there are no more funds available. All 4 domains have either fully allocated their budget or have commitments to allocate to current applications and have no capacity for new ones.
From one point of view, this is a positive outcome. Personally, I stand corrected bacause I admit that during the discussion on this proposal, I had concerns about whether this program would be able to attract enough valuable projects.
From the other point of view though - this means that we do not have a general grant program run by ArbitrumDAO that could address projects looking for some kickstart funding. This is an issue as 1. we should aim for some kind of continuity grant offerings so that dedicated prospective buidlers do not have to look for grant programs in other ecosystems, and 2. ETHDenver with its BuidlWeek is just around the corener, we want to attract new buidlers there to buidl on Arbitrum, but we don’t have any grants for them to continue buidling after the hackathon.
Having said that, we think it’s high time to review how the DDA program went, what was funded, was it effective, etc., and think about follow-up funding, but first discuss possible improvements and necessary changes.
In order to facilitate this process we proposed DDA team to have at least two calls this week - one so that they present to the DAO what they have funded and give comments to those choices, second to discuss DAOs feedback and suggestions.
First one took place on Monday, 5th of February and has been recorded:

21098,danielo,2024-02-06 00:20:03,"There’s a reason why, in the US, politics gravitates around Washington, tech in San Francisco, and Finance in New York. If one of those cities wanted to take a vertical from their rivals, they would have to invest very heavily and execute excellently to beat the network effects. What can we learn about this dynamic for Web3?
Based on RnDAO’s research on social system design and Web3 business models, we propose that Business Clusters (vertically-focused communities, grants, and services) should be a key consideration in Arbitrum’s strategy. Moreover, we suggest that Web3 allows to supercharge Business Clusters by turning them into Swarms (cross-ownership networks of modular and composable projects), thus compounding network effects.
Why choose and be intentional?
As the L2 market becomes more competitive, it’s natural for chains to focus. Past a certain point, sufficient defensibility might not come from technical differentiation. Still, it can certainly come from Business Clusters - a technique that leading nation-states and cities have used for a while.
Business Clusters rely on generating network effects instead of coercive policies to attract and retain talent and businesses. And are usually archived by facilitating:

Clear branding and reputation for a specific vertical(s)
A grassroots community that is collaborative, passionate, and knowledgeable about the vertical
Systems and services that facilitate cross-org collaboration.

By emphasizing community and autonomy (using carrots instead of sticks), Business Clusters align well as a strategy with the ethos of Web3 and the critical needs of L1s and L2s.
How many Business Clusters can an ecosystem pick?
We make a parallel between regions (North America, Europe, etc) and L1s, and a parallel between cities and L2s.
A Hub (country or city) can pick as many bets as it can likely succeed at. The question here is one of capability. Wealthy hubs often invest in multiple business clusters, but each bet needs to be carefully calibrated to be a winning bet. For example, in the UK, London leads in Finance, Culture, and Politics, and these multiple verticals compound to attract talent, capital, and businesses. However, if London wanted to become the leading hub for BioTech, it would have to outspend Cambridge and Oxford in natural sciences R&D, not easy. At the same time, London is competing with cities in USA, France, Germany, and more, so it needs to pick its bets well and is often aided by UK-level funding.
What does it mean to pick a bet?
London did very well in FinTech, becoming this vertical’s #1 hub in Europe. This was facilitated through programs such as Innovate Finance and related institutions, which provided ecosystem development services by

deploying business grants,
partnership facilitation services,
talent attraction campaigns,
and funding research (via universities for foundational research and via innovation agencies and knowledge transfer programs for applied research).

Which verticals should Arbitrum pick?
Note: This is a back-of-a-napkin analysis to illustrate the considerations and make the concept actionable instead of theoretical. A more thorough analysis could be carried out as part of the strategy-making process.

Supercharging Business Clusters through Swarms
Generally speaking, with higher collaboration (and some healthy competition), the use of resources in an ecosystem becomes more efficient, helping a business cluster advance. And with higher enmeshing, it becomes harder for projects to migrate as they would require their partners to migrate, too.
However, most Web2 businesses operate as walled gardens. Membership tends to be binary (you’re either an employee or not), market insights are guarded, the data and source code are kept locked. This reduces the potential for collaboration and enmeshing between businesses and as such, developing Business Clusters with Web2 methods caps the potential of an ecosystem.
Web3 gives us the possibility to supercharge the benefits of collaboration and enmeshing when we turn business clusters into “Swarms” by nurturing:

Modularity and composability
Incentive alignment between projects
Open teams (so talent and ideas can better flow between them)

This can be achieved through Business-Cluster focused venture builders, such as the Co.Lab - current pilot run by RnDAO with funding from PluralityLabs. In this pilot, we

Focus on Collab Tech as a vertical as it serves as a foundational capability for Swarming.
Facilitate a pipeline for builders to create sustainable ventures through 1) funded fellowships for builders to validate a problem (and share the research publicly to attract community). 2) a venture-building program so the builders selected can validate a solution to the problem they researched.
We take a stake in the ventures (not in the fellowships) and use it to create cross-ownership between them, thus facilitating incentive alignment, which leads to further collaboration and integration.
Throughout the pipeline, we educate builders on Swarming methodologies, help them develop strategies for modularity and composability, and further enmesh and support one another.

Swarms build on top of the learnings from Keiretsus (cross-ownership enmeshing of businesses in Japan that has yielded a powerful Automobile Business Cluster with players such as the Mitsubishi Group and Toyota) as well as leading approaches for innovation such as Haier’s (Chinese corporation having leveraging a network of micro-enterprises and collaborative platforms and methodologies to become the #1 IOT company in the world, further solidifying China’s Hardware Business Cluster).
Conclusion
Business Clusters provide a powerful, tried-and-tested methodology for open ecosystems to generate network effects. By combining Business Clusters with Web3 capabilities, we create Swarms and supercharge collaboration and enmeshment, further increasing network effects and sustainable innovation.
A pilot of this approach is already underway through the Arbitrum Co.lab by RnDAO (funded by Plurality Labs). By focusing on Collab Tech, the Co.Lab is building the foundations that enable Arbitrum to replicate the Swarming methodology in other Verticals and compound network effects for attracting and retaining talent, capital, successful projects, and generating more and more sequencer fees.",1
21028,Sebix,2024-02-02 13:14:21,"Arbitrum LATAM Report — January 2024
Project’s Summary & Objectives
The Education, Community Growth & Events domain accepted a proposal at the end of December, designed to make a significant impact in the Latin American region. This initiative, crafted by a trio of projects comprising Atoma, Solow, and Cryptoversidad, aims to educate LATAM communities about Arbitrum, enhance the protocol’s accessibility and inclusivity, foster community growth, and extend its reach in a region as crucial to the web3 world as this.
In line with these objectives, our comprehensive project focuses on fostering growth and understanding within the Spanish-speaking community regarding the Arbitrum ecosystem. The collaboration between Atoma, Solow, and Cryptoversidad is geared towards bridging language and educational gaps, ultimately improving accessibility to Arbitrum’s technology, resources, and community engagement. Over the next three months, we are dedicated to achieving key milestones, including the launch of a new Spanish Arbitrum website, the development of communicational channels, and the creation of educational resources such as articles, podcasts, videos, and tutorials.
Our strategy involves engaging the target audience across various platforms to drive growth, adoption, and community participation. Through these initiatives, we aim to make substantial contributions to Arbitrum’s expansion within Spanish-speaking markets.
In the subsequent report, we will delve into the accomplishments of the project over the past month and provide insights into the upcoming initiatives for the months ahead.
Work Methodology
Atoma has effectively overseen the project’s organization by facilitating weekly calls among the three teams and creating a proficient collaborative worksheet. The primary goals of this worksheet are to enhance transparency, maintain order, foster synergy among teams, and ensure quality control for the generated content.

Covering topics ranging from the core concepts of Arbitrum to in-depth explorations of governance, tokenomics, and practical aspects like deploying smart contracts, the videos aim to offer a thorough understanding of Arbitrum through animated content.
Podcast Series
p0odacsat961×645 100 KB
The podcast series is designed to provide an auditory journey into the world of Arbitrum for the Spanish-speaking community. Through these episodes, the project aims to deliver insightful and accessible content, unraveling the intricacies of Arbitrum’s technology, use cases, and broader implications within the blockchain space. Each episode, with an average duration of 10-15 minutes, will cover a specific aspect, offering an engaging format for users to deepen their understanding. By creating this series, our project seeks to cater to diverse learning preferences, reaching a wider audience and fostering a sense of connection within the Spanish-speaking community as they explore the rich landscape of Arbitrum and decentralized technologies.
Social Networks & Narrative

The project envisions the creation of a vibrant online presence through strategic engagement on various social networks, including X, LinkedIn, Spotify, Instagram, and YouTube. Including a specially crafted narrative across these platforms, revolving around the Arbinauts and the launch of this initiative.
Throughout this first month, this narrative has been unfolding through daily tweets, threads, and engaging content, with X serving as the primary platform for content dissemination in various formats. LinkedIn has been hosting weekly educational updates and DAO-related decisions. After the launch, Telegram will serve as a space for both announcements and community interaction, fostering a conversational channel where the team actively assists newcomers and share educational content. By strategically utilizing these social networks, the project aims to cultivate a dynamic and supportive Spanish-speaking community around Arbitrum, enhancing awareness and engagement within the ecosystem.
Production
The content production has been truly commendable during the month of January. Despite the challenge of collaboration among three different teams and acknowledging that there is still room for improvement, the results are more than satisfactory, and all the month’s objectives have been met promptly.
Additionally, the quantity of educational articles planned for this initial month has been surpassed. Originally set at 3, a total of 5 articles were produced, increasing the overall number of educational articles created by the project during this domain from 9 to 11.
Beyond the planned activities, a project brand book has also been created to unify the aesthetics of the various contents.
Progress in video production has also been rapid during January, and we anticipate that production will further streamline in the coming months through collaborative synergy and teams’ research feedback.
What’s Next? February 2024
February is set to be a dynamic and impactful month for Arbitrum LATAM, laying the foundation for sustained growth, community engagement, and educational outreach. We look forward to the official launch and the positive impact our initiative will have on the Spanish-speaking community’s understanding and adoption of Arbitrum technology.

Feedback and Improvement:
Throughout the hackathon, the builders expressed overall positive feedback with the hackathon organizers and buidlbox. Upon the winner announcement, some builders raised concerns about the judges’ objectivity and the winner selection process. Allo Protocol and Plurality Labs promptly responded, providing constructive feedback on the projects and clarifying the context behind their final decisions.
In response to the concerns, buidlbox issued a follow-up statement on Discord to offer deeper insights into the judging process and winner selection. Initially, builders were frustrated, believing that judging scores alone determined the winners. The statement from buidlbox clarified the two phases involved in judging and winner selection (see “Judging and Winner Selection”), aiming to provide a more comprehensive understanding for participants.
Moving forward, buidlbox is committed to transparently collaborating with future hackathon sponsors and organizers to prevent any future miscommunications. While the judging and winner selection process is determined by the organizers, we are committed to implementing process and feature improvements to ensure participants have a clear understanding of the evaluation process in every hackathon.

20715,danielo,2024-01-18 15:59:00," common issue for grant applicants is finding the right programme to apply to. E.g.
Screenshot 2024-01-17 at 09.12.411130×486 68.4 KB
The issue is not just one of grant applicants having to invest time figuring out where to apply (an issue but not critical). There’s also a way bigger issue under the surface that seriously impacts the DAO (and also an issue in corporations we could improve upon!):
Let’s imagine for the sake of the explanation, a unit to account for how much value a proposal adds to the objective of a grant program




Column 1
Column 2
Column 3
Column 4





Proposal A
Proposal B



Value to community building grants programme
60
100



Value to new protocol grants programme
60
0



Value to XYZ grant progogramme
10
0









Total
130
100










As you can see, proposals that add value across categories (case A) are likely to lose when compared exclusively on their merit in one category at a time. Despite A being the most valuable proposal overall, B is more likely to get funded. This is the issue with analytical approaches (dividing things into sub-categories) vs systemic ones (more akin to adding tags and mapping connections).
What can we do about it?
As far as I can see, the solution for the issue requires embedding systemic thinking across multiple components of the organisation design, and thankfully Arbitrum is early enough that this is quite doable:

Application process for grants: single form (I understand this is already the case), and multi-select as opposed to select-one from the grant programmes menu or even better, not selecting a grant programme but selecting all the strategic objectives to which something applies. Which then leads to a bit of noise but you add a triage system (akin to nurses in ER rooms checking it’s indeed an emergency and otherwise redirecting to GP. We can do this with an AI, e.g. one of RnDAO ventures called TogetherCrew already has similar functionality).
Funding approved for proposals based on aggregating scores across programmes (each programme would assess based on their specific objectives, and then scores aggregated. Scheduling of calls to speak with participants will likely require some coordination and here as well we have a tool called MeetWithWallet to reduce scheduling admin and otherwise, we need a good algorithm for the tally but that’s also quite doable and I don’t foresee major problems).
KPIs will need to be assessed comparing 1) the scores grant programmes gave to proposals, 2) funding used, and 3) per-objective improvement. This is not a major shift but does require us to use the right ontology for BI.

This might seem like quite a shift, but I can’t stress enough how big an impact this makes as an organisation (DAO or otherwise) scales. The nightmare of corporations is people with a great idea going from department to department and it being no one’s problem. Until people lose motivation and disengage. Meanwhile, the organisation stagnates with bureaucracy. We can do much better!
For now, I’m sharing this just as an idea to gather feedback. If it gets positive sentiment, I’m happy to flesh this out more and coordinate with others to flesh it out and advance it.
Note this also relates to what I’ve mentioned in the KPIs thread already here and here and in the Arbitrum Now one here. My hope is that we can embed this sort of next gen organisation design in the DAO and make it a leading example in Web3 and beyond.",1
20715,Manugotsuka,2024-01-18 17:38:45,"Hi, thank you very much for this analysis. I share your idea that it must be frustrating for an individual to create a value proposition and not get the right place to be funded, as it can have a negative impact on the motivation to contribute to the ecosystem. It would be really interesting to try to explore this idea in depth for the creation of a design that can address this type of situation.
In our case, we have experienced these situations in the domain, where several proposals have had multiple approaches involving 2 or even more domains. Therefore, in these situations, we have internal meetings between all domain allocators in order to determine which is the domain in which the proposal would have the best chance of being approved.
At the end of the day all grant programs like questbook are experimental, so these kinds of reflections are important to share in order to improve these programs over time so that as many high-impact proposals as possible have the opportunity to contribute to the ecosystem.",2

20757,tnorm,2024-01-20 07:20:45,"Summarize
In my reflections upon STIP, I touched on a high-level grants philosophy and explored how incentives fit within a greater growth strategy. This post continues the discussion on incentives by exploring alternative distribution methods to existing frameworks (including both STIP and LTIP).
I’ve tried to strike a balance between combating opinions that:

The DAO should invest aggressively in its ecosystem rather than chase perfection and;
Incentives have the highest potential to rapidly waste capital and can be dramatically improved.

I will do my best not to mid-curve this analysis and articulate a complementary approach to the DAO’s current track for Arbitrum incentives. To do so, the following sections will review the existing DAO paths as proposed and present a “direct-to-contract” incentives framework as an alternative.

The point of this post is not to propose an immediate program but rather to lay the groundwork for the Arbitrum DAO to dream a little bigger.
A New Thesis for Network Level grants
Ever since Bitcoin introduced token rewards to incentivize block builders, incentives have been integral to all aspects of crypto. Incentives can be defined as motivating a party to perform an action by giving them a reward. The process is simple: identify a desired outcome, select an action that leads to this outcome, and provide a compelling reward for executing this action.
|624x351.333650190114041600×900 146 KB
Blockchains and smart contracts advanced incentivization by establishing trustless ledgers, autonomous execution, transparency, and permissionless access. Ironically, as blockchains decentralized their control to DAOs, these same technologies have seemingly been forgotten. A lack of infrastructure and tooling for network management has left DAOs like Arbitrum dependent on bureaucracy to brute-force trust through checks and balances.
This post envisions a transition from councils towards a bottom-up, contract-based marketplace for incentives. By leveraging smart contracts, we can refocus the extent of human contributions towards where they most excel — creativity and vision. Meanwhile, market mechanics can handle optimization and efficiency, and code can manage transparency and trust. This approach represents not just a technological shift but a philosophical one, realigning the DAO with the principles of its industry.
Traditional Incentives Programs
Blockchain networks have traditionally (exclusively?) followed a pattern of incentive distribution through projects. The general thesis is that empowering projects inherently benefits the network layer.|586.5293586269195x3301600×900 84 KB
This approach has a few meaningful benefits:

Developer Support: Incentives provide meaningful support to projects and demonstrate a meaningful strategy to further attract developers and projects to the ecosystem.
Domain Expertise: Protocol founders inherently maintain expertise over their projects, presumably understanding user behavior and market demands in their specific market.
Operational Ease: By putting the operational load of distributing incentives on grantees, the DAO avoids the need for both management of incentive operations and, in some cases, analysis.

1600×900 70.6 KB
*The Arbitrum Incentive Working Group expressed in an informal poll that Arbitrum Projects (47%) should be the primary benefactor of incentives over both Users (32%) and Liquidity (13%).
That said, traditional incentive structure also presents meaningful challenges:

Principal-Agent Bias: Projects may prioritize incentives that align with their revenue models rather than the network’s overall goals. This leads to sustainability issues like wash trading or short-term strategies focused on immediate gains.
Strategic Misalignment: Relying on projects for incentive distribution can hinder initiatives requiring cross-protocol collaboration and lead to a lack of oversight, potentially allowing for manipulation of funds for personal gain.
Competitive Advantage: Projects receiving grants receive distinct competitive advantages versus competitors in the ecosystem.
Operational Apathy: A lack of analytical rigor both during and after grant disbursement can lead to misaligned actions going unnoticed or even encouraged; such was the case with a few STIP grants, which presented flawed incentive designs when held against STIP requirements, only some of which were retroactively addressed.

Objective-Based Incentives Programs
While not a solution, I do feel as though it’s worth quickly addressing that the addition of a further bureaucratic layer can bolster a more objective incentives framework (follow-up on this presentation). This borrows heavily from the Optimism Mission and Intents model, which while ambitious is detrimentally confusing and bureaucratic.
Objective-Based Incentives Program
Objective-based incentive programs curb the influence of both councils and projects by structurally requiring alignment with specific objectives and KPIs. At a high level, the foresight to define an objective addresses principal-agent problems’ shortcomings by discouraging applications from embracing an ad-hoc or short-term focus, and instead requiring performance based on predetermined metrics.

Structure and Accountability: This program represents a shift from the traditional model, focusing on objective-based campaigns with clear KPIs and iterative performance evaluations.
Strategic Alignment: While not entirely replacing current decision-makers and applications, this framework aims to reorient them toward supporting specific, measurable objectives. This ensures alignment, including specific strategic goals such as liquidity, user growth, sector targeting, etc.

Example Implementation: A campaign to enhance stETH liquidity on Arbitrum could involve a mix of administrators, councils, and analysts working with projects that align with the campaign’s goals, ensuring that incentives directly support the network’s strategic objectives.
Objective-based campaigns embrace experimentation by establishing accountability up-front and placing outcomes at the center of the grants themselves. Objective-based campaigns benefit from specific KPIs and Objectives, using iterative performance evaluations to ensure accountability over time.
|624x351.333650190114041600×900 139 KB
It’s helpful to think of campaigns themselves as sub-programs, perhaps with a program administrator, a couple of analysts, and an application period for campaign-related projects to apply for sub-grants. Projects that feel as though they could support the mission would apply under the specific campaign goal with their tactical approach to supporting the campaign objective.
For example, if the DAO elected to launch a campaign to support stETH liquidity on Arbitrum, one could imagine:

Balancer incentivizes BLP positions in stable pools.
Aave boosting yield for wstETH deposits
Bridges listing and subsidizing rETH/wstETH bridging to Arbitrum.

As grants are approved, campaign analysts monitor grant efficacy and objectively determine which grants best support the campaign goals and objectives, iterating upon future disbursements over time to optimize per ARB efficacy.
The tradeoff of this model is significantly greater network alignment and DAO control over the outcome at the expense of admin cost, oversight, and greater restrictiveness.
Direct-to-Contract Incentives Programs
The previous solutions are top-heavy, relying on program design to ensure each level of decision-making is informed and accountable. An alternative establishes a permissionless system that allows anyone to direct activity on a chain while producing standardized and easily comparable data for the DAO and community.
|624x351.333650190114041600×900 179 KB
By empowering the DAO to incentivize any contract, the DAO enables a much more powerful playground for network-level incentives by creating a three-sided marketplace between users, incentive creators, and user-friendly frontends.
Components would require:

Discovery: A frontend for users to find actionable incentive opportunities.
Agnostic: A design space that allows for incentivizing most (ideally all) projects and assets.
Customizable: Granular control over incentive parameters.
Permissionless access for:

Contract Integration: Any protocol can integrate with the infrastructure and become eligible to receive incentives.
Incentive creation: Any user can create an incentive using any of the available incentive parameters.
Users: Any user meeting the criteria of an incentive opportunity can partake in that action to receive the incentive.



This is a meaningful evolution of current programs, which does not deter protocol-based incentive programs but rather opens up the design space to include complimentary programs and campaigns that far exceed the capacity of STIP/LTIPP-styled programs.
At the end of the day, this is a program to give incentives to incentive managers, who under a competitive marketplace, the DAO can potentially hold much more accountable than projects.
While this infrastructure develops, I do think a few examples of what an agnostic infrastructure for permissionless incentives enables are worth exploring:

Project Agnostic Incentives

Infrastructure enabling one-to-many qualifications allows for market dynamics prioritizing actual objectives rather than projects.
Example: Incentivize ARB/WETH Liquidity on Arbitrum

Users can claim liquidity incentives across any ARB/WETH LP.

DAO does not select winners nor play kingmaker to existing protocols by giving incentives to some dexes and not others. Rather, market dynamics facilitate selection between where capital flows.






Network-Wide Campaigns

Usage and performance-based (akin to Polynomial) could reward network-level activity by awarding XP levels across the network by rewarding activities across many protocols. To be eligible, participants must collect the required NFT from each of the supported Protocols in the challenge. Incentives could then be distributed based on XP levels held, raffled, etc.


Service Provider Control: Driving Objective Functions

The LTIPP program has established Advisor roles that have suggested various “objective functions” (1, 2) but do not actually give them control over the incentives themselves. Allowing direct-to-contract incentives enables service providers to independently run campaigns, leveraging both the user funnels from the shared network and the detailed incentive parameters for targeted campaign design.
More importantly, this infrastructure discourages a “winner-take-all” dynamic by allowing these functions to compete in the open incentives marketplace, with open data signaling which functions actually perform best.



This vision is ambitious, and an admitted result of disillusionment in grants programs in general. The challenge of instituting systems that are reliant on human decision-making, especially in an environment resistant to empowering individuals, is antithetical to the philosophy of DAOs and can be exhausting. It’s enticing to build everything from the ground up, on code.
Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 8.54.33 AM2792×940 301 KB
This post is an invitation to those interested in developing this infrastructure.
While I think a protocol like Quest Protocol has a role to play in this system (see above), I also believe this is something that must be integrated vertically both across the grants stack (Hedgey, Allo, etc.), and critically integrated horizontally across the ecosystem. In addition, it likely requires hosted frontends, etc. to maintain both operational efficiency on the backend and maximum integrations for users. Lastly, there is sufficient opportunity for data standardization and availability, including a role for analysts and performance monitors to help evauluate incentive managers.
It’s crucial to design contract systems that efficiently distribute incentives and ensure accountability of incentive managers. With easy access to the necessary tools, we can conduct these experiments smoothly and enable open access to creating campaign and incentive initiatives. Simple at first, and growing in complexity over time.
With equal access to tooling, I believe these experiments can be conducted iteratively, with low friction, and provide permissionless access to campaign and incentive campaign creation.",1
20757,coinflip,2024-01-21 18:52:18,"Definitely find the idea innovative and if used as one of the possible incentive models it could definitely be an interested way to directly target our efforts towards specific goals.
In the end the dilemma of people gaming incentives will still exist that was highlighted in protocol based distribution but it will take different shapes.  Specifically the ‘bonus’ for using all protocols on a campaign specifically seems the opposite of the goal of letting the marketplace decide, since you are creating a floor even for poorly implemented options.
Of this larger idea the easiest piece I could imagine being incorporated into the wider incentive efforts while this idea develops is incentive managers.  If we were to appoint small dedicated teams (maybe self nominated but ratified by the Dao) on specific efforts (stETH adoption) who could then provide the feedback on an area of focus, it would be easier for protocols submitting a grant application to show how their protocol helps reinforce the programs highlighted by an incentive manager.  This way protocols can better identify how their campaigns align to chain objectives.  Ex. GMX can show that it’s V2 market have helped to bootstrap $20 million of liquidity for the ARB token both for swap and perpetual trading helping to drive on-chain liquidity for the ARB token.",2

Think this is spot on. Big fan of strategic objectives being used to guide capital.
Even further at the tactical level, the flexibility of the infrastructure means it could also be used as to test/iterate w/ small budgets and give SPs and protocols a chance to observe, prove (and improve) processes before tying them down into larger ARB grants.



 coinflip:

Specifically the ‘bonus’ for using all protocols on a campaign specifically seems the opposite of the goal of letting the marketplace decide, since you are creating a floor even for poorly implemented options.


Understand the sentiment here, think the real benefit is quick iterations. A program’s design is what you make it, any requirements in a cross-protocol campaign could be created as needed, the point moreso being that the optionality is there for campaigns that desire such features without the need for coordinating reward distribution between parties (as actions can be verified and rewarded by the tooling itself).

GMX can show that it’s V2 market have helped to bootstrap $20 million of liquidity for the ARB token both for swap and perpetual trading helping to drive on-chain liquidity for the ARB token.

Hey Arbinauts & Citizens, I’m very excited to share the Arbitrum Citizens Retrofunding Round 1 results!  
TL;DR This is the third QF round in the Arbitrum ecosystem and is part of the Arbitrum on Gitcoin Winter programs which involved three separate efforts:
-The Arbitrum Citizens Round 1 
-The 300k Matching Fest 
-The Allo on Arbitrum hackathon 
Arbitrum Citizens Retrofunding Round 1   
01 November - 29 November
Goal
The goal of this program was to distribute 100k $ARB to best Arbinauts and citizens that have proactively worked and truly impacted the Arbitrum DAO since its launch. We aimed to reward work that helped kickstart the DAO and/or contributed directly to Arbitrums strategic priorities.
For example, contributions in the areas of governance, data-driven decision making , operations, data analysis, education, support and community building around the DAO.
*This round was created for those individuals that haven’t been compensated for the work done and are not employed/contracted by the Arbitrum DAO.
About
The grant program was onchain and used QF to allocate the 100k ARB, that means that the Arbitrum community will vote(only $ARB holders votes over/equal 1$ were eligible) how the funding was distributed to the Citizens=> the more votes(donations) a individual received => the more matching funds they received.
We had a max 5 % matching cap / individual.
If you remember the Arbitrum Domain Round and the Grant Funding Fest you already know we are striving to create a series of the most democratic, community driven and plural grant funding programs in web3!
The program had two phases:
The Grant Application Phase(it was open until the end of the round): The Citizens could apply with their projects and if eligible approved into the program.
The Donation Phase: Arbinauts & donors decided how much money from the matching pool will be allocated to each Citizen, allowing for a more personalized and flexible distribution of funds based on the collective intelligence of the Arbitrum community.
Sybil
Through a comprehensive analysis, a total of 491 Sybils were identified as active participants in the round, accounting for 17.25% of voters. These Sybils accounted for 10.26% of the total votes cast during the round, indicating their notable presence in the voting process. The sybil voted are equally  distributed confirming that the participants were not involved in these attacks. The high number of sybil participation is directly related to the fact that the Citizens round ran during Gitcoin’s #GG19.

Results

We were extremely pleasantly surprised that the Arbitrum community supported the Citizens and Arbinauts with over 12,000$ in donations 
Over 2800 unique donors voted multiple times resulting in over 7000 total contributions 
Over 1100 unique eligible holders( donations over/equal to 1$ and held $ARB by 11.01.2023) voted multiple times resulting in over 2200 eligible contributions 

Some key statistics that further illustrate the success of the Citizens Grant program:

The Arbitrum community showed strong support for the Citizens round, receiving 48 applications and having 25 eligible Citizens participate
~30% of the applicants were proactive in promoting their grant application

Insights:


This participation highlights the community’s strong desire to support various people and initiatives within the Arbitrum ecosystem.


Extremely valuable technical contributions need to be more promoted within the Arbitrum ecosystem


The high number of votes for the Citizens Round demonstrated that they are open and eager to support new types of projects/people.


The results underscored the importance of tailored outreach and engagement strategies for different types of projects and communities within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Proposed KPIs for Arbitrum Grant Programs
Abstract
The purpose of this post is to address some common concerns that we have been hearing over the past few months with the STIP/LTIPP initiatives. The Serious People team has been having a plethora of conversations over the past few months, with that, we feel we are in an optimal spot to summarize our findings and make a number of recommendations to move the ball forward, focusing on better cohesion of all the moving pieces currently at play.
Our goal is to streamline the application, the advisor work, and the council’s ultimate decision making to line up to predetermined KPI’s set forth and agreed upon by the DAO. This will empower the DAO with a standard KPI rubric to be used for this initiative and to be built off of for future initiatives. Additionally, we need a framework that enables us to compare projects on an apples to apples basis regardless of which program they are in.
So with that, the first step to us is aligning on KPI’s that the DAO believes we should be aiming to achieve with the incentive programs. To do that, we must first identify the kinds of actions we want to incentivize, then create a way to convert each of those into a quantifiable number we can plug into a formula, allowing us to compare different programs by normalizing values and return.
We also believe that the current system is set up to incentivise competition to get into the programs, but not competition for who can provide the most value when the program is running. If we can agree on the basic goals of the program, we can evaluate and weigh each achievement, compare that to the value of the tokens emitted for the program and find out what the return is for each program as a percent.
Please note - this is a starting point for everyone to build off of, we are not saying this is the exact answer and we hold all the solutions. We welcome collaboration and constructive feedback!
Serious People’s Recommended KPI Formula: Return on Emissions (ROE)
We believe the best way to define a new standard and normalize returns is by using our Return on Emissions (ROE) metric, simply put:

TVE = Total Value Emitted (the value of each token at the time of emission)
TVR = Total Value Returned (the value brought back to the Arbitrum DAO)
This formula will tell us what is returned for every dollar spent from emissions. If you spend $100k of $ARB and bring $0 of value you have provided a return of 0%. This means that 100% of your emissions were harmful to the ecosystem. That said, depending on how we evaluate each of the factors that bring the ecosystem value, returns have no limit of how high they can go. Arbitrum and the protocols that are participating in the program should have a goal of bringing more value to the ecosystem than they have spent with the incentives. For example, spend $100k $ARB and bring $110k of value to the ecosystem.
So with that, what do we believe brings Arbitrum value? If we do a good job of capturing everything that brings value, this should be relevant for every program moving forward. We took a first cut, but would love to know what others think we are missing!
TVR Buckets

Users from other blockchains
New Defi users
Permanent users
Liquidity acquisition
Liquidity retention
New volume (for your respective protocol or what you are incentivizing)
Retained Volume
Sequencer fees generated by your protocol
Reasons to hold/buy $ARB
Innovation

As we are sure you can tell, some of these factors are objective and some are subjective. It will be difficult to have a perfect formula to evaluate each category, but the more complete our analysis is, the more accurate our comparison will be and the better we can compare projects and incentive programs. Having these goals baked out in advance gives participating protocols a direction on how to use the emissions that ARB gives them, with the target they are shooting for well defined up front. It also gives the advisors metrics to aim for when giving feedback and a more clear way to judge each proposal for the counsel.
This ultimately will also ensure that the application advisors are providing advice to the same rubric the council is voting on, otherwise without this standardization, participants could easily get different answers depending on when and who they speak to, which would only cause headaches down the line and make projects feel shorted.
How do we calculate TVR?
User Metrics - New DeFi users, Users from other blockchains, and Permanent users

Identify a value for different types of users. For example, if we found all new users to arb are worth $10 each and a project brings 100 new users, they net $1,000 of TVR

Liquidity - Acquisition and Retention

Identify how much the liquidity is worth and does the liquidity stay on Arbitrum after the program ends. We can break this into how much liquidity was acquired, and its stickiness to account for retention.
For example, a project brings an average of $500k of liquidity for 90 days and an average of $100k of that liquidity remains for the 90 days after the program. We could say $1k of liquidity for 1 day = $1 of TVR. The TVR would then be calculated as follows: (500190) + (100190)= $54,000).

Volume - New Volume and Retained Volume

We establish a baseline volume number for any project looking to optimize on this KPI, ideally using a 30-90 day average. We then measure the increase in volume over the life of the program, and the retained volume one the program closes.
Using the baseline across all participants and looking at DAO wide goals, we set dollar values for increases in volume and retained volume, similar to Liquidity and Users.

Sequencer Fees generated by your protocol

We believe this one is straightforward, but please confirm our understanding if we missed something. We can measure the fees generated from the protocol’s smart contracts.
We think this would be a great spot to pull in the Treasury working group on this as they are already tasked with figuring out the most effective way to spend sequencer fees, so they should have a good starting point on valuing these fees that we can work into ROE.

Holders

OpenBlock has some beautiful dashboards that were used for past incentives, we would recommend working with them on the following items:

Reason to buy/hold ARB
% of claimed rewards sold
Average duration held



Innovation

We would likely recommend to have this separate from ROE unless the DAO can agree on a fair voting system that the counsel can vote on. We may be able to incentivise certain innovation that the DAO needs higher than others to make this less subjective.

How do we gather all of this information?

We believe that we can gather all of this info by using the research bounty program that is already accounted for in Matt’s LTIPP outline, there is a budget of 200k ARB.
Serious People has already taken a first cut at how we would set the research bounties into buckets and what questions we would propose for each. You can see them here: Research Bounties for LTIPP
Different teams can solve different buckets and define the TVR calculation.
The more questions that are answered. The more we can add to our return analysis and the stronger this rubric can get over time.
Hopefully other DAOs start to see our work and this rubric can help the larger DeFi space!

It is important to note - even if we can only start off with a couple of these categories, it is still a massive step in the right direction in terms of normalizing and standardizing our process, and then we can continue to build and refine from there.
When should we be running these calculations on incentive programs?

We should ensure that each project’s dashboard at least captures TVE and the simple, more objective TVR metrics.
A team or working group should be put in place to analyze the program during and monthly afterwards. It is imperative to look at multiple months past the program end to see how well value was retained. A spike in users is only helpful if we actually keep them active on chain post programs.
Some of the more subjective pieces will have to be held to the end to analyze once, like innovation for example.

Example project (EXP) KPI Evaluation
Inputs:

EXP is accepted into the Arbitrum LTIPP with a 100k allocation of arb tokens.
EXP decides to take 20k of their $ARB to set up a referral program to get new users from other blockchains onto their platform. This program is very successful and brings 3000 new users to arb through their platform.
EXP decides to use the other 80k $ARB to bond into liquidity for their token. This program raises them $70k of liquidity and attracts an additional 75 users.

Assumptions:

Their $ARB was worth $1 each when they emitted it meaning that they spent $100k of ARB or their TVE was $100,000
Each new user is worth $10

How would we calculate their Return to the DAO?
ROE = [(TVE - TVR) TVE] +1
ROE = [($100,000 - ($70k + ($3,075* $10)))  $100,000] +1
ROE = [($100,000 - ($70k + $30,750))  $100,000] +1
ROE = [($100,000 - $100,750)  $100,000] +1
ROE = [$750  $100,000] +1
ROE = 0.0075 +1
ROE = 1.0075 or 100.75%
We would consider this program to be a success as 100k was spend and over 100k was returned meaning that they had a positive return of .75% to the DAO
Conclusion
We believe that taking this approach will perfectly complement the new changes to the program of having a council and advisors.
Aligning the goals of the program and how we compare project outcomes should have the following effects:

Easy alignment between participants in the program, the council, the advisors, and the DAO.
A framework that we can carry into the future and improve on, but quickly establishes a baseline KPI very similar to commonly used financial metrics like ROI or IRR.
Less collusion or favoritism
Better Outcomes as projects have a clear target to shoot for, rather than how the application is currently set up, where we ask projects to come up with their own KPIs.
Allow us to simplify the application so that we are getting only the information we need and less fluff / irrelevant information.

With that, we already took a cut at what we believe the updated application template should look like and have posted it here: Application Template Suggested updates
This will allow us to prioritize two things, lining up to this overarching post.

Projects providing all of the relevant data needed to analyze KPI’s and showing it on their dashboard during the program.
Projects avoid wasting time creating their own KPI’s, having these set by the DAO as we should all be moving toward the same goals anyway.

We welcome all feedback! We want to build this together and collaborate. By no means are we saying we have the complete solution, just wanted to share tangible outputs and recommendations from our conversations so we can keep pushing forward with the DAO!
Additionally we want to thank everyone that has been jumping on the DAO wide calls through Q3 and Q4 last year; your thoughts and feedback were imperative to our refinement process here. We would also like to specifically thank @Matt_StableLab and @AlexLumley for all their hard work, hopping on calls and teeing us up for success with these posts. Also @DisruptionJoe, and the Treasury and Sustainability Working Group, as well as the Incentive Working Group - all been incredible resources!
Let’s make Arbitrum the strongest functioning DAO in DeFi!",1
20416,thedevanshmehta,2024-01-04 20:12:19,"Wow this is really well thought out, I’ve been working on quantifying impact (benefit cost ratios) for over a year now and this is one of the best stabs at it that i’ve seen.



 SeriousPeople:

TVR = Total Value Returned (the value brought back to the Arbitrum DAO)


This is where i can see things becoming most subjective. I’d love it if we have at least 2 application advisors independently reviewing proposals with the formula, so we can measure the variance between their subjective quantification.



 SeriousPeople:

For example, if we found all new users to arb are worth $10 each and a project brings 100 new users, they net $1,000 of TVR


Setting weights on the TVR buckets is another area I’d like to see more work on; how do you plan to go about creating a tip sheet for application advisors to quantify each bucket?
Fact-checking is another area; we will need to rely on self-reporting by projects but we wouldn’t want it to be too difficult for them to calculate, have poor accountability systems encouraging projects to exaggerate claims or disadvantage more humble teams
overall i commend this effort and really keen to see how it plays out in practice. i love how it creates a countervailing incentive for projects to ask for less money (easier to show positive emission) and also provides some basis by which we can increase or decrease amounts given to a project.
A major issue with Optimism RetroPGF or Gitcoin is there is no notion of pricing impact; you get how much ever each voter decides you are subjectively worth. if nothing else, i expect this formula based approach to set an upper limit or ceiling for projects beyond which they cannot get grant money.",2
20416,paulsengh,2024-01-04 20:33:58,"Hi everyone, it’s Paul from OpenBlock Labs.
Thanks to the Serious People team for kickstarting the discussion!
We have also been working on an incentive allocation methodology based on the STIP data we’ve collected, which we will be presenting on the January 9th Working Group call. Our proposal incorporates data-driven feedback loops to dynamically adjust incentive allocations across categories and individual protocols.
In anticipation of our Jan. 9 presentation, we have attached a snippet of the methodology below. We have delineated grant buckets for each category, aiming to create incentives that are robust to the variability of DeFi yet objective in nature.
1221×683 151 KB
In the screenshot above, the variables represent important metrics, such as TVL growth, sustainability index (e.g. fees generated), and nominal TVL changes. Each grant bucket will have a different set of parameters, as different categories may emphasize different KPIs (DEXs should care more about volume and fees than TVL, lending protocols should focus on borrows, etc.).
Constructing a robust incentive model hinges significantly on the availability of high-quality data. OpenBlock’s efforts alongside the STIP have not only allowed us to start the conversation on a data-driven methodology for forthcoming incentive allocations, but have also equipped the community with vital insights to guide their decision-making when voting on future incentive budgets.
Below is a small snippet of insights we have captured to inform future incentives:
Protocol leaderboard:

Market share per category:

Category-level analysis on sell pressure:

Competitive intelligence across ecosystems:

20416,SeriousIan,2024-01-04 23:48:14,"Hey Devansh! Appreciate the kind words and thoughtful feedback 
Love your idea on doubling up on formula approaches, especially for the more subjective items. I think it would be powerful to have the council involved in this piece as well so there is a unified front on how we are valuing and measuring impact. Makes me very thankful for the pilot program approach, as we can take a solid first cut and then improve from there.
In regards to the TVR buckets, I couldn’t agree more - valuing some of those is going to be a challenge. I think thats where the research grant can really shine for us though. We tried to setup those buckets to line up with some of the gaps we foresee in the formula, that way we can answer as much as possible on the formula and fund research to start figuring out a sound way to quantify the rest.
I also hear you on fact-checking and this is something that I have been going back and forth on a lot. Im a huge believer of confirming data so I don’t see how we can avoid this. It does beg the questions tho - should projects be required to track their own status, or is that putting too much burden on them? And do we actually save time as an ecosystem by forcing projects to try to do this, only to have us then have to fact check and potentially fix anyway. Openblock has great dashboarding, maybe we should be pulling this up to the DAO level completely.",4
20416,SeriousKeith,2024-01-04 23:49:01,"Hey @paulsengh , thank you for all of the feedback and Openblock Labs for all of this great work!
I really like your take on separating grant buckets into categories. We were having a similar thought as it is pretty difficult to compare projects in different verticals with different goals.
Love this sneak peak and  cant wait to hop on your call on the 9’th! We would love to hop on a call to discuss either before or after because it seems like your work has a a lot of synergy with our approach.",5
20416,shutsuwei,2024-01-05 12:22:29,"Hi SeriousPeople ,
Thanks for the proposal. I find the logic and reasoning behind the equation to be elegant, simple, and robust.
However, I have a minor concern regarding the inclusion of ‘User Metrics’ in the TVR calculation. Defining ‘new users’ in web3 is challenging due to the pseudonymous nature of it, and it’s easy for one to inflate the metrics. Therefore, it might be better to have a weighting and assign a lower weight to User Metrics compared to other factors.
In addition to the items already mentioned in the buckets, I believe it would be beneficial to include protocol revenue as a metric. This directly influences other key metrics i.e. TVL, liquidity, volume, and naturally creates a flywheel effect.
A critical aspect to consider is the assignment of weight to the TVR components. My suggestion is that each sector should have different weights in their respective buckets, aligning with all projects within that sector. This is crucial since each sector has its unique characteristics - for instance, Leding doesn’t generate high volume, Perps don’t require substantial TVL, and gaming doesn’t need TVL.",6
20416,cp0x,2024-01-05 15:37:52,"Hi SeriousPeople !
Good proposal for efficiency calculationю.
I have some question about this formula:



 SeriousPeople:

For example, a project brings an average of $500k of liquidity for 90 days and an average of $100k of that liquidity remains for the 90 days after the program. We could say $1k of liquidity for 1 day = $1 of TVR. The TVR would then be calculated as follows: (5001 90) + (1001 90)= $54,000)


Correct me if I didn’t understand correctly, but I think that if only 500k are raised to the project, then it turns out to be 5.5555 $ per day. Accordingly, multiplying 500 by 90 is not entirely correct - this would be possible if 500,000 were raised to the project every day.
And the second point - it may be worth considering how much ARB was paid during this period of 90 days and subtracting this amount to understand the real increase in liquidity.",7
20416,danielo,2024-01-05 20:32:26,"Clearly, a lot of thinking has gone into this already!
I’d like to bring an angle so it can serve as feedback and to advance this further.
Quantification works great in well-defined domains e.g. we know now how to compare DEXes. However, quantification often performs poorly in poorly defined domains, or it can even be counterproductive as it reduces success to an artificially narrow set of metrics.
For example, European VCs are significantly funded by the EU, but are subject to constraints that reduce their ability to produce valuable startups compared to USA VCs as Europeans need to fit everything into a formula, and said formula can’t account for the complexities on the ground startups face. Even USA VCs can often harm startups by forcing focus on certain metrics that look good short term but not necessarily lead to a sustainable business. Quantification is full of perils.
As the proposal says, the idea is to compare apples to apples. My concern is how to avoid under-funding all the other fruits that can’t as easily demonstrate value and yet are fundamental for a healthy, thriving ecosystem.
A few examples to look out for:

supporting early stage vs more mature projects (early stage projects could have greater potential but will require more time to give ROE)
supporting well identified use cases (e.g. NFT marketplace) vs innovation (the first offers no USP value to Arbitrum but offers fees short term, the later could provide differentiation and an advantage to Arbitrum).
supporting financial applications vs culture building ones (ecosystems thrive on vibez and not just capital, hence why many people pick London and Paris instead of Dubai, as community flocks where there is a good atmosphere and not just where there is money).
Antisocial vs pro-social projects (some projects succeed at the expense of the ecosystem, while others generate value more broadly).

The above are just a few examples, but the peril is that the metrics are unable to address the complexity of an ecosystem, and in overly simplifying it, end up harming it and driving funding away from that which is valuable but harder to measure. Usually when a metric has been defined, that which is not quantifiable is systematically ignored (unfortunate human bias).
Now, I do believe metrics have a place. It would be great to think through which categories they can apply well to (e.g. DeFi) and which not (culture, collab tech, etc). And then create purposely defined KPIs per category.
What do you think?
A step can be understanding the research that has already been produced over the last decades on ecosystem health, cities attractors, and more recently web3 communities (e.g. article link). A 2-3 month reserach project on this could save major headaches and complement more short-term initiatives that define categories for a first cycle.",8
20416,SeriousIan,2024-01-05 23:32:59,"Thank you for the kind words and feedback!
I like your idea on user metrics, and completely agree with your callout. While this is probably one of the most important categories for the DAO, it is also one of the most easily spoofed. It does seem like we are getting better and better as an industry at pulling accurate info on users off chain. We are hopeful a team can take this category as a grant and solve for these problems (its a large section in the research proposal we posted alongside this one). Then we can weigh this bucket as suggested based on the the confidence of the info that we are gearing!
I would love to hear the best way to calculate protocol revenue as many protocols make revenue a different points in their “sale cycle”.  I completely agree that separating into different categories by project will make the comparison much easier.",9

Love questions! So for this part we were just giving a more arbitrary example of how we could tie these things together. I agree with where your head is at - and we’ll need to work on a way to quantify each of these assuming the DAO agrees on the overall approach with the formula. I know Open Block has some fun ideas as well per their post - we’ll be discussing further on the 9th - you should join!!
In regards to your second point - maybe im missing something but I think we are accounting for that with the TVE component of the equation ",10

You bring up fair points on the more subjective and softer defined domains, would love to hear more!
When creating this post and looking at the best way to compare protocols, we knew that there are some areas that are easy and straight forward to calculate and some that aren’t.  We did our best to leave our buckets as open as possible as we understand that some of these categories feel grimy to quantify.
With that, what specifically would you cut out or how you would tangibly change the proposed KPIs to better accommodate for this? We are also always happy to hop on a call and discuss with you / the larger working group! Its definitely going to take some reps on this one to refine ",11
20416,maxlomu,2024-01-06 21:54:46,"gm Serious People, and thanks for this initiative.
I strongly believe that some standardized KPIs will help to make any program more efficient, fair, and effective. I know the various teams of the different programs are looking at this aspects as well.
I’d like to raise 3 points as food for thought:

Alignment with high goals of the DAO. KPIs should be driven by some overarching goals based on where we want the Abirtrum DAO and ecosystem to be in 1, 3, 5 years. Plurality Labs has done something similar which helps a lot to drive decisions (and measure their success).

image706×1000 123 KB
I suggest that each KPI should align with a specific goal.

Innovation and culture. As @danielo pointed out, these are very critical yet hard to measure factors, but they ultimately decide whether an ecosystem thrives or not. Ideally we should identify specific criteria that transcend financial metrics for projects (or aspects of projects) that fall into this category.

Ex: have you invented a new primitive that is being used by other protocols?
Is your protocol a fork of something else?

Rising market
In a market where prices are rising, it’s easier to show returns, but this should be always compared with the overall performance of the base assets.

For example, this analysis made in December doesn’t paint the best picture for the current STIP, even if the results are positive in absolute dollar value.

20416,englandzz,2024-01-08 02:10:46,"Firstly, I’d like to express my gratitude to the Serious People team for their diligent work on developing the KPIs for the Arbitrum Grant Programs, like the Return on Emissions metric, to streamline the grant application and decision-making process. However, I share concerns about the potential subjectivity and variability in assessing the Total Value Returned (TVR). The difficulty in accurately defining and valuing metrics like ‘new users’ in the web3 environment could lead to skewed assessments. Moreover, I am concerned that over-reliance on quantifiable metrics might inadvertently sideline innovative or early-stage projects that are harder to measure but crucial for a diverse and thriving ecosystem. Therefore, while I support the initiative for more structured evaluation, I believe it’s essential to maintain flexibility and consider qualitative aspects that might not fit neatly into our current metrics but are vital for the long-term health and diversity of the Arbitrum ecosystem",13
20416,aj_eth,2024-01-08 16:42:48,"I think this is the right way to think about the effectiveness, i wonder if theres really a good way to set the weights of the buckets tho, it’s gonna be totally different depending on what kind of protocol it is",14
20416,cp0x,2024-01-08 18:24:29,"Yes, most likely you are right.
I meant that it seems right to me if we take into account differently the liquidity that came during the grant period and the remaining liquidity after that.
Because during the grant period it (liquidity) can be huge, but perhaps no one likes the product itself, and users only came to make money during the grant period )
​",15
20416,danielo,2024-01-08 20:59:36,"So the risk is that KPIs will never be able to handle the complexity of the DAO. That’s been very seriously researched by cyberneticians (see Ashby’s law of requisite variety) and is one of the reasons why OKRs are being criticized so much (they’re too mechanistic and so lead to antagonistic behaviour in their negotiation). The beyond budgeting movement also has contributed a lot here to understand how a small set of indicators can lead to serious problems.
Using the Viable System Model, the idea is that there is a monitoring system (system 3* in their framework for viability) that can both aggregate data from the Units being monitored AND go into said systems to perform audits. So the key here is that the KPIs are not directly (i.e automatically) tied to (re)allocation of funding to grant programmes, but rather serve to trigger audits (i.e. to trigger more in-depth reviews and sense making).
So ideally we want a mix of Health Metrics (general indicators of health, we did some research on this already via TogetherCrew), Growth Metrics (e.g liquidity, new users, etc), and Strategic Metrics (aligned with the positioning strategy and other strategic initiatives).
This matches the usual funding allocation in corporations that goes after

operations (keeping the business processes running day in and day out),
sustainability (things like culture, wellbeing programmes, DEI, etc etc that keep you healthy)
and strategic initiatives (@AlexLumley is advancing something in this regard. the key here is that a lot of Growth is based on foundations that were laid bit by bit showing no direct impact and so only targeting direct growth metrics leads to shortermism and ultimately being outcompeted)
I’ll comment more on the metrics in the research proposal when it comes to executing on the work.

But mention it here to suggest that

the system needs to NOT be connected mechanistically to funding allocation but needs to have space for more variety management in reviews. Which means the need to design said mechanism upfront and not leave it as a concern for later (as otherwise it tends to never happen and things backfire dramatically)
suggest a classification of which KPIs apply as a tagging system rather than rigid categories, as different initiatives will fit differently across buckets (and we don’t want to underallocate to those that do say 30-30-30 across 3 categories vs one that does only one category of KPIs).

So e.g. a programme can have a specific focus (RnDAO as a grant programme does research fellowships and venture building with a focus on Collab Tech), and then the grantees can have varied impact across KPIs (the fellow we selected to research rewards and compensation won’t generate much liquidity but addresses a strategic consideration about operational excellence, while the fellow that is researching a protocol for angel investment will likely end up having an impact on liquidity/capital attraction at some point (mid term) and short term impact on the strategic consideration for operational excellence).
As a grant programme, I want to show the aggregate of the impact of grantees, by bottom up picking KPIs (and potentially adding my own data when the standard ones are not fit for purpose, and then as a programme we can argue why that was a good choice and the community/delegates agree or not to give us more $$).
Let me know if those recommendations make sense ",16

Very interesting thread.
I believe that, in case, projects self report they should be incentivized to provide multiple estimates. For example, worst case and best case scenario estimate. And the average or median gets plugged into the formula.

Abstract:
This research paper explores the integration of the innovative mechanisms from Grant Ships and Numerai into the Long-Term Incentives Pilot Program (LTIPP) proposed for Arbitrum. Our focus is on optimizing the allocation of LTIPP incentives to foster sustainable growth and value creation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. We propose a model where data scientists compete to develop AI algorithms that effectively allocate LTIPP funds, ensuring long-term benefits over short-term gains. This approach is critically evaluated against the backdrop of the proposed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Arbitrum’s user incentive grant programs.
1. Introduction
1.1 Grant Ships
Grant Ships introduces an ‘evolutionary grants game’ within a DAO framework, where subDAOs, termed Grant Ships, compete to allocate capital efficiently. The effectiveness of these Grant Ships is gauged through community votes, rewarding successful strategies with additional capital for subsequent rounds.
1.2 Numerai
Numerai represents a paradigm shift in hedge fund management, utilizing crowdsourced AI models for stock market predictions. Data scientists globally contribute models built on obfuscated data sets, with performance directly influencing rewards based on how well their algorithm performs in simulated stock market trading of a long/short neutral fund.
1.3 LTIPP for Arbitrum
The LTIPP for Arbitrum seeks to distribute incentives to protocols built on the Arbitrum network. This program aims to address the limitations of short-term incentive programs by establishing a sustainable, long-term framework.
2. Proposal: Integrating Grant Ships and Numerai Mechanisms in LTIPP
Our proposal involves leveraging the competitive and collaborative elements of Grant Ships and the AI-driven, crowdsourced model of Numerai to optimize the LTIPP allocation process.
2.1 Objective Function and KPIs
Drawing from the “Proposed KPIs for Arbitrum Grant Programs,” we suggest a multi-faceted objective function that encompasses user acquisition, liquidity measures, volume generation, sequencer fees, and innovation indices.
2.2 Mechanism Design
Data scientists would compete to develop models that predict the most effective allocation of LTIPP funds based on the predefined KPIs. These models would be evaluated periodically, with successful strategies receiving more data or computational resources.
3. Methodology
3.1 Model Development
Participants will access a dataset representing various aspects of protocol performance on Arbitrum, anonymized to focus purely on pattern recognition and predictive accuracy.
3.2 Evaluation and Reward Structure
Model effectiveness is measured based on the Return on Emissions (ROE) metric, aligning with the LTIPP’s KPIs. This approach ensures a focus on long-term ecosystem health and value creation.
4. Analysis
4.1 Expected Outcomes
The integration of Grant Ships and Numerai frameworks is anticipated to lead to more efficient and impactful allocation of LTIPP funds. This method encourages innovative approaches while aligning with the overall objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem.
4.2 Challenges and Considerations
Challenges include ensuring data integrity, maintaining a fair and transparent evaluation process, and aligning diverse stakeholder interests. A robust governance structure is crucial to address these challenges.
5. Conclusion
The proposed integration of Grant Ships and Numerai mechanisms into the LTIPP represents a novel approach to decentralized fund allocation. By leveraging competitive AI model development aligned with strategic KPIs, this methodology promises to enhance the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of the LTIPP in the Arbitrum ecosystem.
6. Future Work
Further research is needed to refine the model, develop more comprehensive datasets, and explore additional KPIs that could enhance the LTIPP’s effectiveness.

18948,teddy-notional,2023-10-16 02:44:39,"I want to kick off discussion for how the incentive grant allocation process could be improved in the next round by proposing a new process. The Arbitrum DAO learned a lot from this STIP and I think we should start figuring out how to iterate on this program now while the experience is fresh in our minds.
The issues
My proposal is meant to address two issues:


Grant amounts per project in the STIP were arbitrary and chosen by the projects themselves. Delegates were then forced to vote yes or no on the grant with little practical ability to influence the grant’s size. For example, a delegate might have thought that project X should have gotten more like 1M ARB instead of 3M ARB, but their choice was between 3M ARB and zero so they weren’t able to express their preference very well.


Grant allocations were dominated by established Arbitrum projects. I think these projects probably deserve the majority of the allocation, but I also believe that it is important to encourage newer and smaller projects with grants in order to promote innovation and growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The STIP failed to do this in my view because it put new projects in direct competition with established projects for funding.


Proposed solution
I think that this process would address the issues listed above and be a fairer and more effective way of distributing incentives in the future.


The DAO authorizes two separate tranches of incentives, one for larger grants and one for smaller grants. For example, the DAO might authorize 50M for larger grants and 10M for smaller grants. Projects are free to apply to either category, but they have to choose one. Newer projects would be encouraged to apply to the smaller category because they would have a greater chance of getting funding by choosing that category.


DAO authorizes four grant size buckets per tranche. Ex the larger grants tranche might have the following bucket sizes:


a. Small - 100k ARB
b. Medium - 500k ARB
c. Large - 2M ARB
d. Extra large - 5M ARB


Protocols choose a funding tranche to apply for, submit proposals and state how they would use the grant depending on how much they get.


When proposals are put up to vote, token holders get to choose between five options per proposal - small, medium, large, extra large, or no grant at all.


A vote for a grant of any size is considered a vote in favor. All projects that make quorum and get >50% of votes in favor of a grant are eligible to receive a grant.


The amount that an eligible proposal would receive would be calculated as the weighted average of the votes in favor. So if a proposal got 50% of the “yes” votes for a large size (2M ARB) and 50% of the “yes” votes for a medium size (500k ARB), their grant size would be 1.25M ARB.


Proposals are ranked by the grant amounts calculated in step 6 from highest to lowest. We then go down the list and award grants to the recipients until the total incentive spend authorized by the DAO in step 1 is reached.

Grant amounts per project in the STIP were arbitrary and chosen by the projects themselves. Delegates were then forced to vote yes or no on the grant with little practical ability to influence the grant’s size.


The projects themselves are best positioned to calculate how big their grant request should be and I don’t think that should change. Delegates did have the opportunity to influence projects’ grant size during the review period, and a lot of projects did alter their requests based on feedback received.
The problem wasn’t so much the process in my opinion (at least not completely), but rather the volume of applications received compared to the time available. I know that we at L2BEAT didn’t have time to review all applications during the review period, provide feedback, keep up with updated proposals and provide follow-up feedback only to review all finalised proposals again before voting. The capacity simply wasn’t there because there were over 100 applications, each of which requires a considerable amount of time to review and do due diligence and cross-checks on.



 teddy-notional:

…it is important to encourage newer and smaller projects with grants…


I 100% agree with that. However, there were several small projects requesting outsized grants simply because of the total budget available. A smaller category with a smaller budget might be a better approach to mitigate such occurrences.
I think there were a lot of lessons to learn through the STIP and how it came down, all of which will hopefully be integrated the next time around. I urge you, and any other person who has feedback regarding the program to join the 7th Governance Call this coming Wednesday (18 October) at 4pm UTC (more info on the call later today) so we can collectively reflect on our learnings.",2
18948,teddy-notional,2023-10-16 17:24:50,"I think you make fair arguments and I will definitely join the governance call this Wednesday! However I want to respond to one point in particular where I disagree with you:



 Sinkas:

Delegates did have the opportunity to influence projects’ grant size during the review period, and a lot of projects did alter their requests based on feedback received.


I think the current process is suboptimal. The way it works now requires an initial phase where the delegates have to give feedback on size, and the projects have to go out and solicit feedback and then come back with a size that they think everyone will support. The problem is that this requires a lot of engagement from delegates. If delegates don’t engage with your proposal during the comment period (like in Notional’s experience for example) then you don’t know if you should increase or decrease your number. It is only reasonable to expect delegates to engage like this on a small number of the largest and most important proposals. So fundamentally, this process doesn’t scale.
If you allow delegates to vote on their preferred size for a particular proposal, you remove the need for this high-touch back-and-forth period which allows delegates to operate more efficiently and for a significantly larger number of proposals to receive effective consideration.",3

18948,englandzz,2023-10-17 10:19:52,"My thoughts on the proposal:
Deciding Grant Amounts:
Projects should be the ones to tell us how much funding they need. It’s their vision, and they understand their needs best. However, it’s crucial they don’t just throw out big numbers without good reasons. If the amount they ask for doesn’t make sense, delegators should have a comment in it. They should be able to suggest a more fitting amount or ask for more clarity.
For smaller projects, especially, they must be clear and honest. They should ask for what they genuinely need, not just a high amount because it’s available. More importantly, they must clearly explain how they will use the grant. A clear plan ensures trust and transparency.
Big Projects vs. Small Projects:
I’ve observed that larger, well-known projects often have an edge. They’re in the limelight and naturally attract more funds. But if we always pour most of the money into these big projects, we’re unintentionally deciding the market leaders and sidelining the smaller projects. This could reduce new ideas and creativity in the long run.
I’m fully behind the idea of having two separate pools of funds: one for big projects and one for smaller ones. Criteria like the total value they handle, their volume, and how involved their users are can be solid metrics to decide who falls into which category.
Let me know what you guys think!!",6
18948,patheboi,2023-10-23 02:40:40,"I’ve been a long-time reader of this forum, though I only recently registered. I concur with your suggestion that there should be two distinct categories, each with its own range of grants.
Category 1:
Bigger Size of Grants
WHO: Projects that have been on Arbitrum for an extended period, surpass a certain TVL.
They can submit a customized grant request, but it should be backed by thorough calculations and supported by reports from previous grants.
Category 2:
Smaller Size of Grants
WHO: Projects that are newly launched, have not yet launched on Arbitrum, fall below a certain TVL.
These participants are required to choose from a predefined range of grants and must provide clear explanations on how they intend to utilize the grants.
The DAO will then determine the amount of grant they should receive, or decide to reject the application.
In this manner, we can hold established protocols to a higher standard, thereby setting a precedent for newcomers. As the saying from Uncle Ben goes, “With great power comes great responsibility.” This approach ensures that even smaller projects have a clear reference point regarding what’s best for Arbitrum and where the DAO’s priorities lie. Ultimately, this facilitates the onboarding of newer projects that enhance the Arbitrum ecosystem.",7
18948,mhiztasolid,2023-12-21 08:43:46,I’m very much in support of this proposal,8
18948,danielo,2024-01-12 12:49:52,"This makes a lot of sense to me. And I would add a further point towards suggesting that smaller/younger projects require more than just capital to thrive.
The STIP advisors are a good step in this direction but I imagine in many cases not sufficient for small project. (When an organisation is smaller and less funded, it’s less likely to have in-house the variety of skills and perspectives needed to thrive).
We have an example of addressing this in the RnDAO+ThankARb Co.lab programme where idea stage entrepreneurs and PoC stage ventures are given loads of support on top of some funds.
What if the Small Incentive Programme grants were distributed via programmes like this (not necessarily exclusively, and RnDAO’s only focused on collab tech (community, ops, and governance tooling) so other can focus on other areas too). Maybe this could ensure small grants have maximum impact?
We learnt from web2 investment that cash alone rarely lead to the best results and hence now we have incubators, accelerators and now even beuind replaced by venture builders/startp studios (even more support to the point of the studio being a cofounder). So maybe something in that direction makes sense?
Not sure the stage at which someone would apply for a 100k grant for the incentive programme, so curious about your thoughts on this direction.",9
19817,tnorm,2023-11-30 01:35:41,"Reflecting on STIP
The Arbitrum Incentives Working Group successfully transformed a contentious governance stalemate into an imperfect, but ultimately successful, consensus framework. With the DAO’s adoption of the framework, delegates allocated 50M ARB in grants across 30 protocols, spurred by over 100 applications from diverse Arbitrum projects.
As the DAO explores initiatives to adjust, extend, and amend STIP, it’s worth weighing the efforts spent on rectifying its flaws against the potential of fostering a vision for more forward-looking, sustainable frameworks. The promise of STIP was a compromise to provide potentially shitty network incentives, with the hope that future investments would prioritize values like long-term growth, user retention, and capital efficiency.
As a largely neutral party, I’ve observed current discourse within the DAO mostly revolves around amending the shortcomings of STIP based on arguments of inclusion and equality. This post aims to frame an entirely different philosophy, positing a shift towards excellence and rigor via grant infrastructure designed primarily to tactically and meaningfully allocate DAO resources towards programs that maximize long-term growth.
A Long-Term Approach
Before STIP’s inception, @raho and I spent months analyzing incentives programs, trolling data and forums, to better understand their impact on long-term growth and capital efficiency. While unable to find robust evidence that incentives are an efficacious long-term solution to growth, we often observed their efficacy to attract both users and capital to protocols and ecosystems in short-term periods, and in some cases drive retention.
This is not a novel discovery, but rather context for how the discussions between protocols, delegates, and stakeholders might proceed. As data from STIP comes in, the goal should be to not just make more decisions, for more projects, over more time, for more ARB…the goal should be to increase Arbitrum DAO’s investment in the ecosystem with the benefits of meaningful hindsight, and ambitious foresight. We should look to improve not just the consensus mechanism (direct voting = never again) of incentive programs, but the fabric of incentive design, analysis and efficacy.
As evidenced by STIP, the objectives set during a program’s design phase critically shape its outcomes. In this context, it feels worthwhile to take a step back to observe a simplistic, but hopefully meaningful philosophy to grants, incentives, and growth.
Grants Programs: A Principled Approach
ARB delegates are responsible for fostering, developing, authorizing, and governing the Arbitrum DAO-governed chains. These governors also maintain the power to allocate and manage all protocol revenue, currently collected by the sequencer and transferred to the DAO treasury.
Assuming Arbitrum network longevity and growth are goals of the DAO, supporting activities that increase sustainable network usage is a meaningful objective for the DAO to pursue. As a proxy for usage, many observe sequencer revenue on the network. Optimism’s RPGF Flywheel has gone so far as incorporating sequencer revenue as the engine of a development flywheel to ensure the network’s long-term health.
Using sequencer revenue as a signal for network usage, we can observe that Arbitrum generates revenue via fees, observing which predefined stakeholders from the Arbitrum Foundation pay these fees may help inform avenues for grant funding.
These stakeholders hold the potential to drive sequencer fees either directly, through usage of the network, or indirectly, via parameter changes and technical developments that might increase network usage by making the platform more attractive to protocols and users. For this exercise, we’ll observe the stakeholders that most directly impact revenue, defining them as:

Network Stakeholders: Chains (ex., Arbitrum One and Nitro) use the DAO sequencer to settle transactions to the Ethereum mainnet.
Application Stakeholders: Applications on Arbitrum chains facilitate transactions to the DAO sequencer on behalf of their users.
User Stakeholders: Users utilize the DAO sequencer to transact, exchange, or use dApps to settle transactions.

Currently, most grant discussions have focused on these direct revenue generators, a motive which is likely appropriate for the Arbitrum DAO’s growth stage. The existing grants programs can be broadly broken into three categories of grant funding:

Ecosystem Development Grants: Grants that support the development of products, tools, and services that leverage the Arbitrum network to achieve their goals.
Ecosystem Incentive Grants: Grants that support the usage of products, tools, and services that are built upon the Arbitrum network.
Internal Development Grants: Grants that support the development of internal resources with the intent of increasing the growth of the Arbitrum network (this could include the administration costs, data programs, etc.).

When it comes to grants, we can also observe popular distribution strategies:

Development Grants: Grants allocated towards community builders for pre-defined scopes of work.
Incentive Grants: Incentive grants distribute tokens to protocols, who subsidize usage of the network when interacting with a particular project or protocol, usually in the form of rewards, rebates, etc.
Bounties: Objective-driven Grants require community stakeholders or grant administrators to define explicit objectives. Prospective grantees can achieve these objectives, and receive a bounty grant for doing so.
Retroactive Grants: Completed projects are reviewed based on their impact and granted after completion.
Incubation: A mentorship program to support and foster early-stage development until participating projects acquire sufficient resources to function independently.

A Role for Incentives
Incentives are one tool. They’re both fleeting and immediately impactful. As such, they are likely better treated as a spice, rather than a main ingredient. To help further contextualize a potential role for incentives, observing each stakeholder bucket in greater detail can help highlight lessons and further determine the efficacy of incentives for growth:
1. Arbitrum Network Stakeholders
Arbitrum Orbit enables permissionless deployment of new Layer-3 and the Constitution empowers the Arbitrum DAO to permit new Layer-2 chains. The demand for rollup chains is clear as Coinbase, Lens, and Worldcoin have all committed to building on Optimism’s OP Stack architecture.
Due to the technical requirements for launching a layer-3 or layer-2 chain, one might expect the Foundation and Offchain Labs to play a critical role in facilitating many layer-3 relationships moving forward. As such, the DAO might consider familiarizing itself with the Foundation’s roadmap, objectives, and recruitment strategies to identify blind spots.
That said, avenues also exist for the DAO to both support and fund Arbitrum Network Stakeholders:

Development fund for new L3 chains.
Development and incubation program for network chains.
Analytics, dashboards, and reporting for launched chains.
Incentive programs to grow usage across new networks and chains.
Retroactive grants for Arbitrum networks that meet performance benchmarks.

The community might research and consider what resources, incentives, and technical and financial support could provide to help fund the development of equally robust brand names on the Arbtirum Orbit architecture.
2. Application Layer Stakeholders
Layer-2s benefit from supporting dApp development more than existing grant programs at the application layer (Aave, Lido, Compound) since applications drive the majority of on-chain fees. As such, the Arbitrum DAO is incentivized to build a robust dApp network.
Observing trends in application usage, user retention, and transaction volumes across many networks can provide insight into how Arbitrum might approach dApp growth.


Native and Niche Applications
Ally Zach, an author of User Retention on Optimism and Arbitrum, discovered some interesting findings including the concept that native applications actually bring sticky user retention. Historically, niche applications that leaned into Arbitrum’s network strengths as a low-cost environment, such as GMX and Radiant Capital, have outperformed non-native applications in user retention.
The trend of outperformed user retention can also be observed across alt-L1s, who’ve seen periods of outsized adoption in niche applications such as Lens on Polygon and even Step’N on Solana. When funding dApps, the Arbitrum Grants might emphasize supporting unique, niche, and native applications that provide better user adoption, retention, and transaction volumes, instead of prioritizing the migration of existing applications or forked protocols.


Arbitrum-Enabled Applications
L2s provide cheaper, faster transactions than Ethereum mainnet. This enables emerging applications that struggled to reach critical adoption on Ethereum layer-1 due to high transaction costs, such as perpetual exchanges, gaming, and decentralized social protocols. One could expect this to enable many new applications and might prefer to see grant funding that supports maverick and novel applications built on this technology rather than merely improved in a low-cost, high-throughput environment.
These two characteristics, which encompass niche, native, and tech-aligned solutions, may better retain users than forked or migrated protocols such as similar mid-tier dexes, perps, and lending protocols. Because of the availability of these protocols, data suggests users will chase any increased yield opportunities aggressively, moving funds to farm short-term rewards but being less compelled to stick around once incentives end or begin elsewhere.


3. User Layer Stakeholders
User adoption programs have existed long before crypto including deals and rewards programs at your local ice cream shop. They also have proven effective in driving adoption for new products, technologies, and services. For L2s, user adoption is often structured via rebates or incentives.
Rebates aim to help subsidize a portion of a network’s transaction cost by allowing claims of a native governance token, helping decentralize the number of governance token holders. Rebates can be structured in many ways, including a claimable stipend held in a smart contract or retroactively via an airdrop to eligible users. Near Protocol, Optimism, and Avalanche have all conducted notable incentive programs.
Given the permissionless nature of blockchains, incentives in crypto are particularly vulnerable to being abused by rent-seekers who use these programs to receive rewards without the intention of returning to the products and services they engage with. Takeaways from Optimism’s Governance Fund distributions help demonstrate how these types of programs can help boost short-term metrics (TVL, transactions, fees) but have a varied impact when looking at long-term, annualized, and post-program metrics. This is not to say incentives are bad, only to suggest that, as a community, Arbitrum can learn from these lessons to design better and more effective incentive programs.
A large goal of STIP is to internalize these learnings with data, so the community might improve its decision-making moving forward.
Some Areas to Explore:
No one knows incentives better than the protocols who deploy them. Many of these takeaways are well known. But from the admin level, the DAO should focus on rewarding designs and programs that embrace efforts to IMPROVE their capital efficiency, and IMPROVE their odds of retention and long-term growth.
Better Incentive Designs
Incentive design is a powerful tool to generate user traction. One example: Blur, covered in this case study by Spindl, used a dynamic incentive program that shifted over time, offered expectations for long-term rewards, and focused on siphoning volume and liquidity from competitors. While this aggressive approach may not work for all programs, the DAO should work with incentive program applicants to develop specific strategies that are thesis-driven, measurable and improvable.
Designing User Experience
Educational elements in incentive programs may aid in retaining users. At Optimism Galxe Quests actually far more effective at bringing transaction volumes, and new users, than liquidity mining programs (which brought more capital).
Combining these aspects to a more comprehensive UX is worth exploring to further determine the effects of education on future engagement, and adoption. Establishing long-term and recurring reward cycles designed around user experiences should be worth exploring.
Liquidity & User Dynamics
An exploration in DeFi, liquidity provider engagement in relation to user engagement, (Supply/Demand analysis) is potentially under-observed. Observations like understanding of what liquidity thresholds are required (at an ecosystem and protocol level) to catalyze meaningful volume or demand for a given asset should be explored as the DAO looks to bring users to Arbitrum in a competitive L2 environment. Specifically, marrying these insights with user behavior and customer preferences would provide meaningful insight in the design of objective based grants for specific tokens/assets (LSTs, stables, etc.).
Accountability and Transparency
The DAO, Foundation, and all open-source organizations should hold standards of transparency and accountability. This includes grant programs. STIP took pains to include this despite the rapid deployment of the program via grant streaming w/ Hedgey and self-reporting requirements. Simple disclosures such as the contract addresses used to disburse incentive funding, incentivized pool addresses, etc. helps dramatically when observing the effect of programs overall.
Data Infrastructure
Without the infrastructure to collect meaningful data on the DAO’s programs, it’s nearly impossible for the community to create meaningful impact. In the long-term, dashboards, analytics, and reporting should be required of all incentive programs, whether funded as an internal effort by the DAO or a requirement of participating programs, Optimism Lab’s Analytics program is a great starting point, and Plurality Labs’ work to fund Open Data initiatives are a promising step for Arbitrum.
Granular data is also important. Analysis must be conducted on a per asset, per pool, and per protocol basis, to gain meaningful insights for future grant design.

Optimization
Great incentive programs also are willing to iterate by experimenting and optimizing their programs. This can be designed at the grant level with planning by the grant provider. The DAO could guide grantees and ask projects to release their incentives in tranches, measure results against pre-established KPIs and provide rolling optimization to deliver effective results.
1412×416 25.4 KB
Velodrome, an Optimism-native DEX, has been a leader in evaluating OP incentives. Their program analysis post outlines their evaluation framework and key takeaways. Through diligent research, analysis, and effort they demonstrably improved the value returned per OP over time.
For maximum capital efficiency, a robust incentive program would work with grantees to structure objective based grants with metrics and milestones up front, distribution in tranches to measure impact against measurable targets, track performance to identify effective vs. ineffective strategies, build in flexibility to adjust future programs, and perform robust reporting and retroactive impact evaluations to improve future programs for everyone.
Governance Implications
Lost in all this is the actual implications of token distribution on governance. Establishing governance flywheels that analyze claimant participation in governance, their delegation habits, and claimant behavior in general will be essential to ensuring incentive programs align with DAO goals.

19817,DisruptionJoe,2023-11-30 02:12:54,Thanks for your effort and all you’ve done for this program. This is one more example of the quality you have brought to Arbitrum in this process.,2
19817,brisket,2023-12-04 18:37:02,"Unfortunately STIP grant allocations have been IMO quite disappointing so far. They benefited individual projects, some of very low quality, and not the ecosystem as a whole. This approach looks bad for the whole ecosystem and make arbitrum look like a grifting friendly L2. In particular, using tokens to boost (project token)/ETH pools only helps the project who received the grant. It’s a roundabout way for them to offload their tokens.
If we set as a high-end goal to see activity move from mainnet to Arbitrum then there are a few objective things that we can use grants toward. Here is a non-exhaustive list of things that benefit everyone in the ecosystem:
-High ETH/USD liquidity
-Low stablecoin borrowing rates
-Fast and cheap bridges
Making a list of such public goods and having grant proposal explain how they help them would ensure that the next grant distributions are not so wasteful.",3
19621,ZER8,2023-11-17 14:52:52,"Hello, Arbitrum community I’m very excited to share details around the ongoing Arbitrum Citizens Retrofunding Round 1 - a grant program designed to reward the individuals that helped build the DAO . This is part of AIP-3 Milestone 1, you can check out the proposal here.
TL;DR The goal of this program is to distribute 100k $ARB to Arbinauts and citizens that have proactively worked and truly impacted the Arbitrum DAO since its launch(without being rewarded for their contributions).  This is an onchain grant program that uses Gitcoins protocols on Arbitrum One.
The Arbitrum Citizens Retrofunding Round 1   aims to reward proactive work that helped kickstart the DAO and/or contributed directly to Arbitrums strategic priorities. For example, contributions in the areas of governance, data-driven decision making , operations, data analysis, education, support and community building around the DAO.
The Arbitrum community will donate and decide how the 100k $ARB will be distributed to the individuals via QF(a vote is actually a donation). The benefits of using QF is that we will have signals of which contributions were perceived more valuable by the overall community + the donations raised.
We believe this is a great chance to show the web3 ecosystem how a DAO can support its early contributors in a plural and fully transparent way so let’s spread the love
This round was designed to reward those individuals that haven’t been compensated for the work done and are not employed/contracted by the Arbitrum DAO or other entities, if you know someone that contributed to the DAO please let them know
The grant program is onchain and uses QF to allocate the 100k ARB, that means that the Arbitrum community will vote(only $ARB holders votes are eligible) how the 100k gets distributed to the individuals => the more votes(donations) a individual receives => the more matching funds they receive. Max 5 % / individual. Only donations over 1$ will be considered.
Important information for those that want to apply  


Application period: 30 October - 25 November

Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP) Oversubscription
At present (T-10 hours to vote end), ~29 projects fit into the 50m ARB budget.
In addition, there is currently a list of 26 projects with 1) 71.51m ARB quorum and 2) >50% in favor votes, which have collectively asked for 24.4m ARB worth of grants.
image939×593 25.7 KB

Given that >50m ARB request fulfill the quorum and voting criteria, a round 2 will no longer be held if there are no further votes to extend the framework.




STIP - Round 1: Voting Period Update Incentive Framework (Round 1)


UPDATE: 50M ARB Budget Reached:
As of now the 50M ARB budget for STIP has been exceeded. This means there will be no Round 2 as there is no budget remaining. 
Should the DAO wish to extend this framework, it may create a second proposal to either extend the budget for STIP to fund a Round 2 program OR create a proposal for an additional program to help meet the community’s extended demand for grants 
I will continue to provide updates on the status of the funding as the voting period comes to an…
  

It is apparent that there is significantly more appetite to approve grants than had expected, with 74m worth of grants or 1.5 times the amount of initially approved budget currently tracking for approval, implying 74% of total requested ARB grants being approved.

Extension of STIP Grants
We believe that an extension of the grant program is warranted.
Our reasoning is as follows:


Fairness: Exceeding 50m ARB was a somewhat unexpected outcome. Unfortunately, there were projects that were 1) waiting to apply in round 2 or 2) missed the deadline in round 1. Now with no round 2 happening, these projects will be denied of the opportunity to apply for the grant, which we think is somewhat arbitrary. The list of projects that have kickstarted round 2 applications is here.


Grant diversity: For an ecosystem to thrive, we believe it is not only important to have large hallmark projects but also a diversity of smaller projects that have the potential to grow into ecosystem stalwarts. The top 5 requesters which are currently eligible collectively have 27m ARB requested. Extending the grant program will allow the DAO to honor its initially promised rules while letting in more smaller projects the opportunity to help grow the ecosystem.


We do understand that the initial consensus was leaning towards a 25/50m ARB grant program size rather than 75m. However, we do think that after going through the first round of pitches, opinions might have changed and from the voting results, we see that voting participants do think more projects should receive the grant than previously thought.
There have already been lively debates in the initial STIP thread. In our view, the quantum of extension should be chosen by the DAO, which we think could be:

Do not extend
Extend STIP by 10m ARB
Extend STIP by 20m ARB
Extend STIP by 30m ARB

With the recent clawback of the unclaimed airdropped ARB, there exists enough to cover the remaining 24m, and then some. I think there’s a compelling case to be made here since ~74m passed and one of the original ask options was 75m.
The main thing I believe in extending the rest of the budget to the rest of the protocols is to ensure increased opportunities on Arbitrum during the following months, plus to prevent stifling projects who can’t compete with those who passed.
Happy to hear the opinion of others but I think the overall benefits outweigh any downsides.",4
18800,ZIsBraindead,2023-10-13 06:23:36,"Even just 20M more ARB, less than half of the original STIP, would give so many more protocols that were voted in favour of an allocation.
The purpose of grants is not to benefit the largest players with even more backing, but to allow the smaller guys a chance to prove themselves (especially in this STIP), so I believe it would be beneficial to extend the STIP amount to somewhere between 70M-75M. There is really not much downside.",5
18800,Mantis,2023-10-13 06:40:35,"Its self-evident the current STIP framework lacked nuance having well-established non-native projects pooled with Arbitrum native projects (90% probably launching amidst this bear market).
Personally, if we want to stay true to the standard logic behind grant initiatives and how they typically function, the allocation should be extended to projects that made quorum but missed out on an allocation.
This will help enable long term blockchain usage, supporting native projects to continue to apply maximum bandwidth on the Arbitrum blockchain.
Additionally, it shows future innovators and builders that they can recieve support if decided to build on Arbitrum, despite competing against large, chain agnostic projects.
Thanks for your time.",6
18800,Trantor,2023-10-13 06:48:43,"It is great news that we are able to have this discussion as it demonstrated the passion and commitment that protocols and the community have for our ecosystem. The other side of the coin could have been almost nobody voting!
So to my mind, this proposal is an easy win for the entire ecosystem!
Extending the grant by the additional 25M (or 20M or 30M) will see many of the projects who did very well get their allocation and thus avoid having the biggest protocols simply get the biggest grants because they are already the biggest. ie, just cementing their positions.
The wider these grants are spread to quality projects, who have support (ie over 70M votes and more than 50% in favor), the better. Increased capital flows are a benefit to all and the more it is spread amongst builders the better!",7
18800,Jonezee,2023-10-13 06:55:21,"Concur with the sentiment that an extension would be just, considering a number of good projects didn’t make the cut because of a budget limitation rather than a lack of support.",8
18800,Shoos,2023-10-13 07:08:29,"The DAO’s treasury allocation should be able to accommodate this requested increase as it was an option on the initial proposal when determining grant amount. By implementing this adjustment, the projects achieving quorum will all have the opportunity these incentives provide. This not only upholds the principles of fairness but also acts as a catalyst for innovation and diversity within our ecosystem.
It’s also worth noting that a significant number of projects that secured allocations from the initial 50 million grant have received funding in the past, which could solidify their dominant position. Without providing incentives to the rest, there’s the potential that established projects become complacent, with no real motivation to compete and innovate, propping up their platforms using grants alone. All the while, the upcoming projects struggle against the grant ARB being distributed, regardless of the tech the top projects are using.",9
18800,relied,2023-10-13 07:20:47,"While I do understand that there is disappointment from some participants / protocols, this is the natural outcome of the 2 step vote we had. First the maximum program size is approved, then protocols apply with the reasonable asks and it is voted on the total of those applications. If the overall size of the grant program would´ve been bigger to begin with it surely would have led to bigger asks and eventually to a similar outcome with disappointment, same for a smaller overall program size.
While I am not against a second round / additional funding I do think the focus now should be on the execution of the first stage and to follow the spending of the approved funds and the contribution to growth of the arbitrum ecosystem. Starting an extension of the program right away undermines and devalues the steps that have been taken by the DAO to get this program started and should be postponed to a later stage, in my opinion.",10

I think one thing that is obvious if you look at the chart is that projects that were larger were more likely to get voted in at a higher position. They have larger communities. So smaller projects asking for smaller amounts were largely the ones who made quorum and had enough yes votes, yet were not able to get enough votes.
The outcome of “Do you get a grant or not” should be decided by the result of the vote on a case by case basis. The way this proposal was setup, it put larger protocols in the front of the line.",11
18800,Chuba,2023-10-13 07:56:53,"Agreed for an extension here as well, for projects which made the quorum, which was the main target to receive the grant. The 1st come 1st served basis was there in case too many projects were successful, but it shouldn’t limit Arbitrum expansion. Enough people voted FOR for each of them.
Once this final process is ended, we could start thinking about giving the funds to all projects. Let’s remain focus and logic.

18800,zdeadex,2023-10-13 08:28:28,"In terms of diversity, i’m still wondering why it’s allowed to ask for more than 20% of the total grant for only project.
The cap should have been below 10%, which is still too much (probably 2% so 2M cap per project - looking at data it makes sense).
I do believe than 10 projects requesting less than 1M $ARB is worth than 1 requesting 10M $ARB, even if it’s a big protocol.
Saying this, I think extending to a round 2 make sense with determined cap per project.",13
18800,Lunaman,2023-10-13 08:42:23,"There are two main issues we have detected with the way the STIP process has been designed.
1.) Teams shouldn’t be spending time and resources lobbying to delegates. Of course the time that was given to review all proposals was minimal taking into account all projects that applied for the program so teams had to resort to private communications with delegates instead of having public discussions that would benefit all projects.
2.) The design of the program forced projects into competition instead of promoting collaboration between all of arbitrum’s builders. We should have done a budget per category where all the protocols per category would collaborate and come up with a unified budget that would need to get approved by the DAO. I think we are promoting the wrong values with this STIP design and should be corrected immediately to, again, foster innovation AND collaboration instead of competition.",14
18800,0xAlpha,2023-10-13 10:10:48,"The primary objective of STIP is to enhance Arbitrum’s ecosystem by drawing in more developers and community engagement.  As the first round stands, the top five eligible requesters have collectively sought 27m ARB. Extending the grant program adheres to the DAO’s initial commitments, also opening doors for more projects to contribute to the ecosystem’s growth.
0xRamen’s post concerning the STIP extension aligns with this aim. We ardently support this initiative and are optimistic that the Arbitrum DAO will provide solutions fostering a robust growth within the Arbitrum community.",15
18800,Nailax1,2023-10-13 11:26:31,"I support your suggestion

18800,bflynn,2023-10-13 12:42:52,"I’m for extending this by 20M.
If the grant is extended by 20M, then according to the stack ranking from Round 1, an additional 20 projects will receive grants, which is a clean number. It’s worth noting that 29 projects received grants with the current 50M budget, so this will be a substantial increase and lead to a more diverse Arbitrum ecosystem.
It’s important that the Arbitrum DAO supports new projects in the ecosystem and rewards projects that have ambitious plans to expand the ecosystem with good proposals. This will result in not just more competition, but more innovation in the Arbitrum ecosystem which is a net positive for ARB holders.
It’s also worth noting that we should avoid these types of proposals in the future. This was a huge burden to ARB delegates, who felt pressured to sift through the 100 applications in just a week. I don’t think any delegate enjoyed this process, and we should work on creating proper accountability & transparency systems to grant recipients so we can iterate on results.",17

Given the unforeseen explosion in popularity of this grant program, it is highly advisable to broaden its scope and include other projects that have successfully met the quorum requirements. This initiative has absolutely no downside; quite the opposite, it stands to significantly benefit our ecosystem.
This extension not only ensures that more deserving projects receive crucial support, but it also serves as a substantial boost to the overall health of the ecosystem. By nurturing native projects and expanding their horizons, we are actively contributing to the growth and development of our ecosystem as a whole. So, let’s proceed this expansion in mind, knowing that it’s a win-win scenario for all involved.",18

An extension will also limit the unfair advantage some of the older, more established projects had in STIP round 1, which will increase competition and innovation.
There needs to be much tighter caps on what projects can request in the future.",22
18800,teddy-notional,2023-10-13 14:21:14,"I support an extension of the STIP to give an allocation to projects who got quorum and passed but did not hit the vote cutoff. It’s fair that Arbitrum incumbents receive their share of the grant outlay due to the contributions they have made to the ecosystem, but it’s also important that Arbitrum encourage new projects instead of shutting the door on them.
I think an extension in this situation is fair and will help support a new batch of projects that isn’t already well-established on the chain. I also think that this should be an explicit goal of future grant programs and we should structure them differently to avoid getting in this kind of situation again.",23
18800,romang86,2023-10-13 14:21:53,"I want to show my strong support for this idea and explain why using a ranked-choice voting system would benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.
First of all, I want to say that I appreciate your careful attention to the grant program’s progress and your proposal. More people want grants than people initially thought. The demand is about 74 million ARB, much more than the 50 million ARB the foundation had planned for. This shows the community is enthusiastic about supporting projects and growing the ecosystem.
The idea to extend the grant program makes sense, and here’s why:


Fairness: You mentioned fairness, and I agree. The unexpected demand for grants and the absence of a round 2 could mean some projects miss out on the chance to apply for funding. This isn’t fair to those projects and doesn’t help the ecosystem grow equally. Using ranked choice voting would make the decision process fairer and allow us to consider all projects more equally. This would reduce some blatant lobbying and “horse trading” (favors/backdoor deals) that have been happening.


Variety of Projects: Ecosystems are healthiest when they have all sorts of projects, big and small. Big projects are essential, but we (the community) also need smaller ones that can become big in the future. Extending the grant program lets us support big, established projects and the more petite, promising ones. Ranked choice voting helps us make these choices more carefully and ensures a mix of projects that benefit the ecosystem to grow and thrive.


Changing Opinions: You also pointed out that people’s opinions might have changed after the first round of voting. Ranked choice voting is significant for situations like this. It lets people express their preferences more accurately and adapt to the community’s current needs. This keeps the grant decisions in tune with what the community wants.

I don’t agree with this. After talking to many ARB delegates, many of them did not enjoy the process of voting in Round 1 because of the large sheer number of proposals. This solution will only result in a large number of proposals once again. We should avoid burn out by ARB delegates by seeking to rectify the extension to Round 1 participants and iterating on results with the lessons learned.

STIP - Round 1: Voting Period Update

UPDATE: 50M ARB Budget Reached:
As of now the 50M ARB budget for STIP has been exceeded. This means there will be no Round 2 as there is no budget remaining.
Should the DAO wish to extend this framework, it may create a second proposal to either extend the budget for STIP to fund a Round 2 program OR create a proposal for an additional program to help meet the community’s extended demand for grants
I will continue to provide updates on the status of the funding as the voting period comes to an end.


The options here are create a new independent proposal all together or run a round 2",28
18800,DanThales,2023-10-13 14:58:55,"29 projects received 50m.
35 projects were voted in but are below the cut-off.
This vote created a very competitive and destructive atmosphere where each DAO had to fight for votes while in parallel ensure others don’t get more votes than them.
It’s the opposite of what the Arbitrum ecosystem intends to be.
As the result of the vote, the major ecosystem projects just got their existing large share cemented it. Maybe that is indeed the best for Arbitrum, but there is no doubt that the smaller projects trying to carve their way also deserve a fairer fighting chance.
Doing another voting round with yet another hard cap of 20m would definitely yield similar results with more projects voted in than the hard cap, and will again leave more than 50% of project below cut-off, even though their proposal formally passed.
If the funds are there, and we know there are, I think all voted in grant proposals should be honored.
A potential round 2 should allow all new projects to submit proposals, but without a hard cap, so that each grant is decided on its individual merit.",29
18800,teddy-notional,2023-10-13 15:05:26,"Are those really the only options? I would support a round 2 if that’s where we end up, but couldn’t we start by voting on one of three options?

Do nothing.
Allocate an extra X ARB to proposals that passed quorum in the original vote but didn’t get the cutoff.
Re-do the entire process with a round 2 only open to projects which didn’t receive a grant in round 1.

To make a metaphor in US politics, imagine an election of the 100 senate seats. To say let’s have a second vote to add 30 more seats for the next 30 people in line because we like them defeats the outcome of vote #1.
Personally I’m burnt out as well as I took 30+ pitches from projects involved in STIP and read almost all of them. I wouldn’t want a second round. But extending to include projects that missed the cutoff because I’m burnt out isn’t the correct indicator we should be optimizing for.",31

18800,Midgetwhale,2023-10-13 15:40:57,"I think we should go with a pro rata distribution rather than a hard cut-off.
If a project is deemed to ask for too much, the vote should account for this and allocate that project less than requested.
Simplified example:
I.e.
Project A asks 10M
Project B asks 7M
Project C asks 3M
Budget = 10M
Total requested = 20M
Project A gets 100M votes
Project B gets 200M votes
Project C gets 50M votes
Now multiply the votes with ARB requested:
Project A: 10 x 100 = 1000M
Project B: 7 x 200 = 1400M
Project C: 3 x 50 = 150M
Total: 2550M
Now divide the budget with the total Vote*arb:
10M/2550M = 1/255th
Now multiply this factor with the vote*arb request per project:
Project A: 1000M/255 = 3.9216M ARB
Project B: 1400M/255 = 5.4901M ARB
Project C: 150M/255 = 0.5882M ARB
Total distributed is 10M
This way there’s nothing like a hard cut-off, the vote impacts directly the size of the distributed funds and there will be less stress for all actors involved because the repercussions are less drastic.
Now, missing one or two major delegates may have been the difference between getting millions of ARB or nothing at all.
If we keep doing this, bribery and corruption will seep into the system.",35
18800,wagmi,2023-10-13 16:16:20,"Strongly support an increase of the grant amount to support and fund all the projects that met the grant criteria, passed quorum, and got >50% of votes.  These are all projects with strong community support and the overwhelming demand, support, and governance participation is an indication of how thriving the Arbitrum ecosystem is.  Especially in a bear market, it’s important for well-funded foundations to support and invest in the ecosystem to establish dominance (over competitors), and clearly these are projects that have strong community buy-in.
I support choice #4: Extend STIP by 30m ARB
If there is a concern about the total amount of ARB being distributed, I think a pro-rata distribution among all qualifying projects would be a much better solution than imposing a hard cutoff.",36
18800,Hubirb,2023-10-13 16:36:46,"Thanks for proposing this, I think it makes total sense.
This STIP was great but highlighted a few issues. One of them is that rules changed between the snapshot vote and the execution of the vote. With the voted allocation (final allocation on a first-come-first-served basis), nearly all projects would have received their grant (52 out of 64, compared to 30 with this new cut-off method invented 24h before the end).
Second issue: a handful of projects are trusting the quasi-totality of the STIP, leaving dozens of projects who passed the governance vote with nothing. Those projects are generally projects who already made it, are very profitable, and don’t really need additional subsidies, but managed to push massive grant request thanks to their governance power.
GMX alone takes 24% of the program (even though with the voted allocation method they should have add $618k).
First 4 protocols take half of the STIP, and 2/3 are taken by the top 8.
image1739×452 13.4 KB
One of the ideas that could help would be to “flatten the curve”.
Furthermore, these funds are not efficiently helping to bring value to Arbitrum since they are going to be concentrated to already successful Arbitrum native projects. Top 8 mentioned above is all native Arbitrum projects (except Trader Joe). If one of the objective of this program was to incentivise protocols to come and build on Arbitrum, it is however sending the opposite message: “don’t come on Arbitrum, you are not welcome and won’t be able to compete with our native projects”.
In my opinion there are a few possible ways going forward to maximise the efficiency of this STIP (which needs to be efficient as it is still a 50m ARB investment).
There are two main categories: A) rething the distribution process to make the STIP more efficient and fair, and B) increase the enveloppe.
A) Adjust the distribution process for a fairer and more efficient STIP keeping the 50m ARB enveloppe
1/ Keep the voted process of first-come-first served basis
This would lead to 52 beneficiaries instead of 30, and only 12 projects would be left out with nothing despite them passing their proposals by the rules.
2/ Distribute pro rata of asked grant:
That’s the normal way to do things in finance: when a pocket of money is overallocated, every body is downsized proportionately to what they asked for.
3/ Adjust the cap amount that could be given to a single project
If the total amount that can be given to a single project for this 3 month period is 1.5m ARB, then every project can receive their fair share of the STIP.
Here is a little table of what each solution would give:

B) Increase total enveloppe
Two ways here: either we increase straight to get all those good projects the funding they deserve, and not do any second round, or vote an enveloppe for second round, and consider the projects who passed already at this round but had nothing, as qualified already for this second round.
I would personally lean towards adjusting the capped amount so that everyone can get allocated, but any step towards more fairness or efficiency of this STIP would be in the right direction.",38

Growth and test different incentive models to gather data.
We can’t fix the latter one, the STIPs were shaped by the delegates to adopt these models. So on that goal, the program failed.
But for growth, there is still something that can be achieved. What is the single best driver for growth? Competition. Competition leads to innovation, to efficiency. Why restrict competition by perverting the markets by using what amounts to subsidies to give an unearned advantage to some?
All the protocols past the quorum and and more than 50% ‘for’ rate were deemed good enough prospects to support to achieve better growth for Arbitrum. That was what the program was about. But why use this short-sight of the program design to go against the primary purpose of the program?
The DAO passed a growth program. Now enable growth. Don’t create artificial barriers for projects YOU yourself found good enough to allocate funds to.",43
18800,Telaga,2023-10-13 21:28:21,"Great post @0xRamen!
I would like to echo many thoughts and comments here and big thanks to all who made this happen and delegates for engaging so quickly.
On Fairness: 1) There may be legitimate projects that have / are building great products and may have not been able to apply in round 1 and now will be excluded from the STIP. This also applies to many who did not make the initial 50M cut. 2) Many smaller Arbitrum native projects missed out on the ARB airdrop and are still building their connections in the ecosystem; this has meant that they have been at a disadvantage in the voting process and as noted above, many deserve to be a part of the STIP. As it currently stands the largest projects are getting a disproportionate share; arguably deserved based on their impact but this is limiting growth potential for the network.
Better proposals = more impact: We at Chronos (and many others) have had great discussions with delegates and the wider community and are keen to use feedback to make better proposals in a new round. A collection of new and improved proposals would bring higher and more widespread efficacy to the STIP / on ARB spent that is also more reflective of the community.
A new and improved round:

A new round with 25M (75M total STIP spend); first come-first served; pro-rata if oversubscribed)
1 week review + 1 week voting
No project can receive more than 10% of the entire spend
50% of the total is dedicated to Arbitrum native projects
All STIP ARB is distributed at the same time over a total of 16 weeks starting on the day of 1st distributions
Any remaining ARB is left unspent or subject to additional proposals

No project can take the lions share of ARB + through improved proposals brings more impact on ARB spent + gives legitimate ARB native projects that are committed to the ecosystem a chance to bring more widespread network growth + gives delegates more time to review as their workload has been quite significant
As noted by @Hubirb a capped for individuals / pro-rata distribution is a great idea to be applied across the whole STIP (personally would like to see this after a 2nd 25M round) but not sure larger voter / protocols would vote to get their ARB capped; keen to expand on this",44
18800,blazedbison,2023-10-13 21:53:59,"Just echoing many of the thoughts here that its a no brainer to extend the grant to all projects who met quorum + had >50% For vote.
I will add that it would be labourious to both the projects who have already gone through a draining campaign in rallying delegates, and to the delegates to have to all vote again on a new round.
It makes the most sense to me to just extend the ~24m ARB (this would be a small amount more tha. The 69m ARB recovered from unclaimed airdroppees) to the projects who were eligible under the original criteria.
From the FAQ in the grants discussion:
What happens if the budget is exceeded?
“We do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 50M ARB.”
It’s great news that there was unprecedented demand for the STIP, and shows a strong and healthy ecosystem of builders.
“In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals”
It is more than reasonable in my opinion that the DAO backfunds successful incentive proposals.
The majority of which are smaller projects and deserve to be given a chance to show their worth to the arb ecosystem.

18800,Pruitt,2023-10-13 23:24:28,"While @404DAO’s governance team has not had a chance to discuss and agree on our stance on extending the STIP in some fashion, I would like to share some data our team put together that shows how the top 75 delegates voted. We were curious to see if delegates approached voting with the mindset that the sum of supported proposals should be kept within the budget of 50m. Below is the breakdown:
Ask amount1920×1813 295 KB
Generally speaking, this was true for the top 75 delegates who had an average “spend” of 39m, but 6/10 of the top delegates by voting power exceeded the 50m mark.
From the voting results, it’s also clear that some delegates believe numerous projects deserve some of the STIP funds.
Personally, I also lean towards supporting an option that helps fund the smaller projects that didn’t make the cutoff but passed the vote. Like many other delegates, I’m also burnt out from reviewing so many proposals, but I look forward to hearing other delegate’s opinions and taking the weekend to think about other potential options.

18800,Mantis,2023-10-14 01:15:33,"I would like to express my strong concern about the proposed approach. Your suggestion to extend incentives exclusively to the protocols that have passed the allocation threshold appears to have potential drawbacks. Postponing this extension would result in an unwarranted increase in workload, necessitating two distribution processes and potentially the introduction of additional rounds of proposals, along with the burden of re-processing by delegates if holding a seperate, second round.
It’s crucial to acknowledge the potential implications on the underlying value of the Arbitrum token when contemplating a distribution that excludes certain projects. This approach would necessitate every protocol to reevaluate their proposal amounts, which could introduce unnecessary complexities into the process.
As several members of this group have already emphasized, the alignment of the proposed incentives program with the broader vision behind the grants seems inadequate. Given that this is the inaugural Arbitrum DAO grants program, it is reasonable to expect some inefficiencies in the framework. However, it is imperative that these inefficiencies are identified and addressed in an iterative manner to ensure a strong alignment with the long-term success of the Arbitrum blockchain.
Let’s not add unnecessary beaurocracy.",51

It was amazing to see the community (through delegate voting) choose their favorite proposals to incentivize, but seems like there was a miss-connection between the total amount requested, and the budget. It also speaks very loudly about how much developers want to build on Arbitrum. Not every blockchain can get the amount of participation (from Protocols, but also voters) in just one week. It was kind of mind-blowing.",54
18800,peter,2023-10-15 03:52:55,"The question is why choose an amount of 50M but not 75M, or 100M?
It’s not just about the amount, but also about the choice of DAO and the competition for allocation. Even if the program received a larger fund, there would likely be bigger requests from protocols. So, the end result would remain the same. Chosen protocol still be chosen. It doesn’t make sense to ask for an extension after losing votes, and it seems a little pathetic to me…",55

[deBridge] [DRAFT] [STIP - Round 2] Incentive Framework (Round 2)


    Application Notice 
Dear Arbitrum community, at deBridge we were originally considering to apply for STIP — Round 2, but due to the heavily oversubscribed Round 1 and based on Snapshot voting, that funding will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis, we’d like to publish our application now (earlier than the official start of Round 2 submissions) due to lack of certainty whether the total of 50M ARB would be distributed evenly between two rounds. 
We’re posting earlier to make sure gran…

 Dog:

With the recent clawback of the unclaimed airdropped ARB, there exists enough to cover the remaining 24m, and then some. I think there’s a compelling case to be made here since ~74m passed and one of the original ask options was 75m.


In my view, allocating the unclaimed 24-25M airdrop to augment the grant would be advantageous for our ecosystem. The airdrop’s primary intent was to support and nurture ecosystem expansion, especially as we are in the early phases.
However, there’s a pressing concern. Large-scale projects, given their extensive user base, could monopolize a significant portion of this grant. This dominance might overshadow smaller endeavors, potentially hindering innovation. These lesser-known projects can offer unique and valuable insights.
Therefore, I propose designating a specific portion of the grant exclusively for smaller, yet promising, projects, emphasizing those with potential for attracting funds and users.",65
18800,Britt,2023-10-17 16:46:49,"Hey 0xRamen,
Thanks for taking the lead on putting this framework together for extending the STIP. I have a couple of questions for you about your proposed amount. You indicate that there were ~24M of approved requests that we weren’t able to fund, AND a decent list of folks who had started putting together drafts for round 2 already. It’s clear to me that we really underestimated the demand/interest of the ecosystem in this opportunity, which is a good problem to have imo. With that in mind, do you think that the max value you proposed of 30M would sufficiently cover the opportunities we want to fund?
I also wanted to ask what your hopes are for feedback here and what you’d like to see in terms of moving this proposal forward to a vote. If I can be of any help, please let me know!",66
18800,englandzz,2023-10-17 17:19:44,"I would like to address a discrepancy in the data you’ve presented. According to the Inspex data you referenced, JonesDAO requested 2M ARB. However, based on the actual project proposal, they only asked for 200k ARB. This error affects the total grant calculations. By my calculations, taking all project proposals into account, the correct total should be 72,250,544 ARB, not the 74,050,544 ARB you cited. (total grants - Google Sheets)
Building on this point, and acknowledging the robust enthusiasm for the STIP, I’d like to express my concerns about the proposed extension of the grant program. While there’s no doubt that all qualifying projects stand to benefit substantially from an increased pool, we must take a step back and evaluate the broader market consequences of such an expansion.
From a detailed analysis, taking into account the cumulative grant requests and the proposed 3-month program timeline, I’ve deduced that we are potentially looking at an emission rate of approximately 802,783.82 ARB/day. This number, when translated to the current market value, amounts to a staggering $642,227.05 of ARB that could be introduced into the market on a daily basis.  And 72,250,544 ARB($5,7800,435.2) selling pressure in 3 months period
The market could experience significant selling pressure, leading to potential price volatility or depreciation. This doesn’t just affect traders or speculators, but every participant in the ecosystem, as the ARB’s value and stability are foundational to the success and perception of the entire project.
Lastly, while I understand the initial consensus may have leaned towards a grant program size expansion, I’d like to remind the community that our decisions should be rooted not just in present circumstances but also in considerations of longer-term sustainability and market health. It’s essential to strike a balance between incentivizing new projects and ensuring market stability.",68
18800,Viperr,2023-10-18 13:04:17,"Really insightful breakdown, @0xRamen! Viperr from Rage Trade chiming in.
We wholeheartedly back the proposition of expanding the ARB budget for the short-term incentives program to allow protocols in round 2 a chance. Many protocols like ourselves were expecting this budget to be evenly split amongst both rounds, allowing a fair chance for all projects, irrespective of when they were onboarded to the Arbitrum ecosystem or what size community they have.
An extension of the budget not only shows commitment from the Arbitrum team towards fostering a growing and collaborative ecosystem but also ensures that emerging projects don’t get left behind.",69
18800,0xRamen,2023-10-18 14:58:32,"Thanks all for your replies. A couple of themes have emerged in the discussion, thank you all for the input - has been incredibly valuable and had many points that we had not thought of. The main one being how should the extension work?
We put together the discussion thus far and summarized some pros / cons.



Option 1: Continue with round 2. Continue with the existing program structure where we hold a round 2, everyone from round 1 who had not qualified can retry in round 2. Supporters - @limes @DanThales @mint_cloud @deBridge
Pros: Beneficial for projects who waited for round 2, Projects with >50% in favor votes + quorum but missed the 50m ARB cut-off get a second chance
Cons: Projects with >50% in favor votes + quorum but missed the 50m ARB cut-off will have to canvass for votes again





Option 2: Grant extension to round 1. Give out remaining ARB grant to the projects missing the cut-off with >50% in favor votes + quorum but missed the 50m ARB cut-off. Supporters - @teddy-notional @bflynn @blazedbison
Pros: Projects with >50% in favor votes + quorum but missed the 50m ARB cut-off do not have to canvass for votes again
Cons: Projects who waited for round 2 will likely not get a chance (there are 24m ARB worth of grant requests which will likely take up a significant proportion if not all of the extension)





Option 3: Pro-rata distribution. Give out grants where Project grant = ( project vote * project request )  / sum ( all project votes * all grant requests ) * budget. Supporters - @Midgetwhale
Pros: Better distribution of funds, not winner takes all
Cons: If retroactive, changes the initially proposed rules, disbenefit to already selected grantees






Arbitrum's Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal)

In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.


Both Option 1 and 2 are viable options but we prefer Option 1, given that:

This will give a chance to projects who were waiting on round 2 a fair chance at application
It is also not all negative for projects with >50% in favor votes + quorum but missed the 50m ARB cut-off, since they will be getting a second chance, versus no grant currently.

We are generally not in favor of retroactively changing the rules, which rules out option 3.

That said, we prefer for the community to decide on the nature of extension and suggest the next steps for this is to proceed with a 2x temp check votes:


How much to extend STIP by?

Option 1: 10m ARB
Option 2: 20m ARB
Option 3: 30m ARB
Option 4: Abstain



How should the extension work?

Option 1: Continue with round 2
Option 2: Extended STIP grants to go to projects with >50% in favor votes + quorum but missed the 50m ARB cut-off
Option 3: Abstain



Following which, the final vote should be a combination of the above, for example:

Option 1: Extend the STIP by 20m ARB and continue with round 2
Option 2: Do not extend the STIP

Hamstringing this explosive growth seems counterintuitive.",74
18800,Dog,2023-10-19 00:35:35,"I understand that if it was a closed loop, but the entire point of the STIP is to bring NEW capital into the system. Socket got 1m ARB to promote bridging into Arbitrum. Fresh and new capital WILL bridge in for good incentives, as is what we want. DexA-DexB-DexC are not necessarily fighting for the same capital. It’s as simple as X% yield is desirable by LPers, they dilute each exchange to the point where those yields align. Higher yield on all of them, more capital flight to achieve that target APR. This is very common and “cannibalize” isn’t a real concern here-- we want to promote competition on fair grounds, not asymmetric advantages.",76
18800,dk3,2023-10-19 01:04:12,"If this was true I would think this would be the case for the dollars already on Arbitrum. But it seems that not to be true:
DexA 3mm LP 5%-15% APR
DexB 723k LP 14%-31% APR

Was just giving my explanation on what types of proposals I would support.
But I am just a single opinion, maybe other delegates disagree.",77
18800,Dog,2023-10-19 01:23:09,"There’s lots of nuance in that, but I’m not sure how to prove a point with fake variables. An anecdotal example I can give is that we are in close contact with large capital providers and it’s as simple as: “show us the X% yield and we will deploy all capital feasible to it.” Full stop. Dexes aren’t the only ones to compare. Lending markets experience the same thing. The only place there is asymmetric yield is typically more obscure and less proven protocols.
Besides the point, fresh capital will bridge over to Arbitrum (as it has in the past), with incentives. There is frankly no reason a top chain like arbitrum would experience zero growth and create a capital vacuum/closed loop. I can assure you with full confidence TVL on chain will skyrocket as a result.
Competition is good, and the whole point of decentralization is to allow competition to thrive innovation on seemingly level playing fields.",78

As Dog stated above, the goal of STIP is to incentivize short-term. There will be 50M in ARB given already which will create explosive growth and delaying the incentive extension can be counterproductive.
Furthermore, agreeing again on a sum for a hypothetical Round 2 means repeating the exact same mistake of this past round. That is we are agreeing on a sum without knowing the demand for incentives and again creating a bottleneck that can repeat ad infinitum.
Extending round 1 for the projects that achieved quorum + the 50% for/against gives us a known demand quantity with the extra benefit that these proposal HAVE already been approved by the delegates in both extent and size. A round 2 where all this projects submit a replica proposal as in round 1 just unnecessarily complicates the work of delegates.",80

I would say that my comment about the pro rata proposal was not so much to be applied retroactively to the vote of round 1, but just to get the idea out there for future STIP-like contests or thus, perhaps for round 2.
As such, I would not necessarily see it as a competing third option but rather something that could be implemented if the community would either agree to move forward with a Option 1: Continue with round 2, or even if the community selects option 2 but does not want to provide funding to the full 24M extent.

One thing the advocates of the Option 2: Grant extension to round 1 are not considering is that delegates knew and did vote according to the agreed rules, which were very clear:
Only 50m were going to be allocated, only with those criteria.
Implying that the other protocols that didn’t meet the threshold would have automatically achieved it with a larger grant cap, is not correct. Delegates could have voted more strongly against proposals - instead, we abstained or didn’t vote against projects that were not meeting that specific threshold.
The options here should be only to create a new independent proposal, or run a round 2.
Changing anything for round 1 would be unfair.
STIP round 1 ended with those results, and I understand it’s frustrating for protocols/communities that didn’t make it, but there will be (and we can create) new initiatives.",89

Why would we not just reward those projects and extend the grant to them when
i. The demand was totally unprecedented (a good thing)
ii. The vast majority are smaller, new, and different (read: not defi) projects that could contribute massively to the ecosystem
iii. The unclaimed airdrop amount was more than expected and would easily cover the ~ 22m additional being requested?
Anyway, I look forward to the AIP for the extension going live and hope you and other delegates can see that this is a net positive for the Arb ecosystem",98
18800,Lunaman,2023-10-29 07:45:17,"To be honest, I still fail to understand the arguments against backfilling the projects that met the criteria and didn’t get funded.
If these projects met the requirements it is because the great majority of the DAO’s voting power assessed the proposals and deemed them valid of getting the grant. The reason that these projects did not get filled comes from the fact that we pulled the figures of 25M, 50M and 75M $ARB out of a hat without first probing around to figure out if this even sufficient to satisfy demand. The total demand was for around 120M $ARB and the DAO decided that projects’ requests amounting to around 74M $ARB should pass and get the funding, that’s the only valid piece of data we have. Everything else are just conjectures and what ifs.",99
18800,ArbOG,2023-10-30 03:23:37,"Very bad take, we’ve dropped the ball on not forecasting properly demand for STIP in terms of total ARB required. We’ve allowed for backroom deals and most delegates-connected protocols to meet the threshold and get funded. Arbitrum is not 29 projects. If swift extension with round 2 doesn’t get voted in, it will be catastrophic to rest of the ecosystem projects that can’t compete with others due to zero sum game. You should know better Matt, you guys specialize in research right? How about some research piece on the impact of 100s of Arbitrum projects that will suffer major decline in activity and potentially be forced to seek activity outside of Arbitrum ecosystem because they can’t compete without incentivization. 3 months of time is enough to create permanent damage to ecosystem with negative long term impact. Who knows but this type of unbiased research could actually score you some points for your coalition proposal ( feedback coming soon )
The STIP voting results made it clear, the process favors protocols selected by essentially the top 3 delegators to be winners. This punishes those who are not among the chosen (and those who didn’t submit their STIP proposal in time), with little regard to the value they provide to the ecosystem. As a result, they are destined to be short term losers and might even end up turning lights off for good.
For example, in coming months Uniswap and Sushi will lose volume to Camelot, TraderJoe and Balancer due to incentivization. Premia, Dopex, Rysk and Good Entry will dominate over Hegic, Lyra and other A+ option protocols, yet without incentives Hegic currently organically dominates options category in terms of fees ( top 8 in fees from all protocols on arbitrum in last 30 days per defilama ) . Where is the logic in punishing indirectly Hegic here for example? Why aren’t “research” firms asking those questions? Unless protocols come up with their own incentivizes to compete, they will underperform.
I’ve listened to your spaces on Friday and it seems like you, @maxlomu, Gauntlet and few other large delegates internally agreed to go against any extension plans. To me it looks more like a coup against Arbitrum ecosystem. Please provide some stats on potential positive / negative impact that no additional funding + round 2 will have on rest of the ecosystem. We can’t drop another ball here on all the legit projects that are building in the space and simply want to fairly compete with those that got grants approved and soon to be funded.
To summarize - Arbitrum risks losing builders and legit projects because of zero sum game. You can’t compete organically with incentivized projects hence 29 projects will succumb most of activity in their respected categories, where the rest will suffer drop in activity.
We need to act NOW, without unnecessary delays and support plans for extension and round 2. I’m completely outraged that some of the large delegates don’t see this or choose to turn the blind eye on destructive impact this decision might have on entire ecosystem.",100
18800,dennison,2023-10-30 19:11:56,"Hey folks!
Dennison from @tally.xyz here!
The STIP proposal has been incredible to see, so much activity! I’ve been thinking about this problem a bit: allocating incentive funding across a diverse ecosystem of builders.
I was curious as I go through the problem maze- would it make sense to set a budget that is distributed to teams based on the percentage of votes they win, potentially with a cap? (So that there is an upper ceiling to the grant with the expectation that more teams could be funded?)
Another way of doing it might be to set a budget, and then allocate some number of spots to fund, with each spot receive a decreasing portion of funds? So Top spot gets 10% of the budget, second spot gets 7%, and so on and so on?
While I’m not addressing the current discussion about a round two, I am thinking about how at Tally we could help make this process more scalable and inclusive for everyone.",101
18800,Djinn,2023-10-30 20:30:02,"Hey Dennison, I think certain grant structures could definitely have some sort of weighted distribution of funds in an overflow scenario.
For this specific STIP framework, the data to back budgeting wasn’t there - and it was very difficult to project with unlimited proposal limits for the largest projects, BUT the creators knew this and had backup options just incase the exact overfunding scenarios were met, which is great.
An extension reduces workload on everyone, and adjusts a weakness of the STIP process into a strength that supports all projects across verticals and project size.
My concern around having a scaling funding model like you mentioned is that it hurts the smallest projects with the least political pull even more than the STIP process currently does, and it just means that their already smaller asks would be trimmed down even more.
Another option would be a way to just proportionally allocate funds based on the amount proposed, as long as the proposal passed quorum and other requirements.",102
18800,dennison,2023-10-30 20:49:16,"Hmm yeah thats a great point, what if there was a maximum cap as well as a minimum cap? You of course will still need the political strength to be included at all, but at least a minimum cap would mean folks don’t get percentage wise pennies.",103
18800,Djinn,2023-10-30 20:59:13,"That could make sense, I think the challenge is creating a framework that sits as the foundation of future grants but offering levers like caps, max allocations, overflow mechanics that can adjust per each grant type.
Keep up the good feedback.",104
18800,dennison,2023-10-30 21:31:18,"Thanks! I’ll keep thinking about this, there is probably some MVP version of this which could streamline the process more so that we could do it more often and for more types of things. I’m excited to think about it!",105

19219,ZER8,2023-10-27 21:56:29,"Hey community, I’m very excited to share the Arbitrum on Gitcoin Grant Programs results!  
TL;DR The goal of the Arbitrum on Gitcoin programs was to create a grant program that is co-designed with the Arbitrum community by leveraging Gitcoins protocols. This collaboration also brought Grants Stack to Arbitrum One, thus allowing anyone in the Arbitrum ecosystem to launch a grant program on it.
What’s unique about the Arbitrum on Gitcoin Grant programs is that we allowed the Arbitrum community to help us design a grant program from start to finish thus empowering it to be the key decision maker:

on how to distribute funding to key domains - Domain Round
on how to distribute funding to the projects - Grant Funding Fest

Another positive aspect is that QF(vote = a donation) also enabled the growth of the funding allocated from 100.000 DAI to 120.000 DAI.
The Arbitrum Domain Round 
14 August-30 August
The Arbitrum Domain Round was the first Arbitrum initiative launched in partnership with Gitcoin. This move combined the size and power of the Arbitrum Community with the ethos of Gitcoin and the magic of quadratic funding.
Goal
To allow the Arbitrum community to decide how to allocate 100k $DAI in matching funds to five strategic grant funding domains by using QF(quadratic funding) as QV(quadratic voting)
About
This round had 5(4 corresponding to QB) domains and the Arbitrum community could vote(donate) for their favorite one using QF.The domains were:
1.Gaming: This will help Arbitrum encourage more developers to create innovative gaming experiences and thus onboard new users to its ecosystem
2.Developer tooling on Nova: This will help Arbitrum build essential infrastructure, tooling for Arbitrum Nova
3.New protocol idea: This will encourage more contributors to propose and run experiments for improving the Arbitrum protocol
4.Education, community growth & events:This will help Arbitrum attract quality builders through community growth activities such as education courses, bootcamps, hackathons and sponsoring events
5.Open TBD Round
This round was a unique experiment. Unique because the “grants”’ in the Domain Round represented the future matching pools of the next funding round - The Arbitrum Grant Funding Fest.
We used Quadratic Funding as Quadratic Voting and the votes are calculated by looking at direct donations of DAI using the Gitcoin user interface. Only the $ARB holders’ votes were counted in.
Sybil detection
Our analysis discovered 42 confirmed Sybil entities that were strategically distributed across 11 distinct clusters out of the 832 voters, equating to 5.04 % of all votes.
Sybil Vote Distribution: Surprisingly, the Sybil votes in this round were almost evenly distributed among the various projects. This distribution implies that the primary goal of the attack was to establish identities for these Sybil addresses rather than to manipulate funding allocation.
Points scored1200×742 43.4 KB
Consistent Voting Patterns: We observed consistent voting patterns among Sybil entities within each cluster, confirming their collaborative efforts.
Points scored1200×742 25 KB
Impact on Funding Allocation: The sybil activity had no significant impact on funding allocation during the Arbitrum domain round. We removed all the donations from the sybil accounts from the matching calculations.
This favorable outcome, however, raises concerns about Sybil entities’ potential strategies in future rounds.
Results
The round was well received by the Arbitrum community and we received support from multiple organizations within Arbitrum! We raised 5000$ in donations from the Arbitrum community raising the matching pot to 105k $DAI. Over 420 Arbitrum community members voted(donated) and we had over 1600 contributions in total.
The matchings distributions voted by the community are displayed below:
1249×675 120 KB
Insights:

We were pleasantly surprised that the Arbitrum community embraced the program even with the high gas fees of the Eth main net.
The Arbitrum community appears to value New protocol ideas at least 50% more than the other domains.
The votes for the Open Round demonstrated that they are open and eager to support new types of projects.
Over 420 $ARB unique holders voted multiple times totalling over 900 contributions

The Arbitrum on Gitcoin Grant Funding Fest
04 September - 30 September
The program was the first on-chain grant initiative within the Arbitrum ecosystem(run on Arbitrum One) and continued to build upon the success of the previous Domain Round held on Ethereum’s mainnet. The matchings as voted by the Arbitrum community in the Domain Round became the matching pools of this round.
Goal
The goal was to empower the Arbitrum community to grow a sustainable, bottom-up and plural ecosystem in which everyone can contribute, either by building the future of Arbitrum DAO or donating to the projects that do.
About
The program had two phases:
The Grant Application Phase: the builders, creators and innovators could apply with their projects and if eligible approved into the program.
The Donation Phase: Arbinauts & donors decided how much money from each matching pool goes to each grant recipient, allowing for a more personalized and flexible distribution of funds based on the collective intelligence of the Arbitrum community.
The program had four individual grant rounds, each with its own matching pool:
Gaming:…………………………………………………………….……14.5k $ARB
Developer tooling:…………………………………………………………24k $ARB
 New protocol ideas:………………………………………………………. .50k $ARB
 Education, community growth & events:………………………………12.5k $ARB
By donating people decided how the matching pools were distributed via quadratic funding(QF). To ensure maximum fairness only votes from people that held $ARB in their wallets on 04.09.2023 were counted in. Self donations are also excluded.
Sybil detection
Multiple sybil detection mechanisms were used including cosine similarity. Because of its high detectability, the cosine similarity method excels at revealing scripted transaction patterns typical of Sybil wallets, rendering identical scripting patterns infeasible for subsequent grant rounds. This approach has been critical in identifying and comprehending Sybil attackers, particularly those who use blend-in strategies.
Sybil Vote Distribution: The Sybil votes in this program were not evenly distributed across the 4 rounds. Some rounds have more sybil votes than the others, ranging from 5-9% per round. It is unclear if this distribution implies that the primary goal of the attack was to establish identities for these Sybil addresses or to manipulate funding allocations in certain rounds, our findings would indicate that both scenarios should be considered. There is also a probability that some of the sybil votes might be involved in “airdrop farming” activities.
Impact on Funding Allocation: The sybil activity had low-low medium impact on funding allocation during the Arbitrum on Gitcoin Grant Funding Fest. The New Protocol Ideas round has been the most attacked round due to the nature of the projects.
In the following section, we present a summary of the results for every round.

After our on-chain data analysis, donations from addresses associated with these behaviors were excluded from match calculations. This includes the following:

​​Flagging known sybil networks/addresses from Gitcoins 40k address blacklist
Suspected bot activity based on anomalies detected in transaction patterns
Suspected bot activity based on anomalies detected in donation patterns

Results
The Arbitrum ecosystem really embraced this program and the response from the community was overwhelmingly positive, over 2500 people donated and we also received a lot of support from Arbinauts!
The results(including non $ARB holder votes) are displayed below:
1249×675 106 KB
Some key statistics that further illustrate the success of the Gitcoin Grants program:


The Arbitrum community showed strong support for the grant fest, receiving 140+ applications and having 51 eligible projects.


The total votes/contributions from $ARB holders can be seen below:
      -220 voters and 654 total contributions in the Developer Tooling round

      -270 voters and 804 total contributions in the Education, community growth & events round

      -278 voters and 928 total contributions in the Gaming round

      -333 voters and 1142 total contributions in the New Protocol Ideas round



Over 2,500 individuals made donations, resulting in more than 6,000 total contributions.


Donations exceeded 16,000 $ARB, in addition to the initial 101,000 $ARB available in matching funds.This showcased the positive impact of the Quadratic Funding (QF) grant program in Arbitrum, allowing funds to be allocated based on community preferences while bolstering the initial matching funds.


The final matching amounts that will be paid out are shown here
Insights

This participation highlights the community’s strong desire to support various projects and initiatives within the Arbitrum ecosystem.
One key learning from the round was that the allocation of matching pools in the Domain Round did not precisely align with how people donated to projects in this round.
Some rounds that received fewer votes in the Domain Round managed to attract significantly more donors in the Gitcoin Grants program. For instance, the Gaming Round, which received only 12% of the votes in the Domain Round, garnered approximately 2.5 times more in donations (amounting to $4,000) compared to the Developer Tooling Round, which received over 20% of the votes.This highlighted the effectiveness of certain rounds in promoting their grants within the Arbitrum ecosystem and engaging their respective communities.
The results underscored the importance of tailored outreach and engagement strategies for different types of projects and communities within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Notion Detailing the Ideas & Direction thus far → https://specops.arb.vote/ ←
Motivation


No group exists driving a long-term vision for the Arbitrum DAO. Thought Leadership and Coordination are needed.


The groups with the most to lose are the projects driving value to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Thus, projects should be driving this initiative. No central point of failure should exist within this group.


There is an opportunity cost to building on Arbitrum; other ecosystems are providing incentives like covering infra costs, funding development & investment, flagship representation & marketing, both in dollars, incentives, resourcing, and support. Projects do not want to leave Arbitrum; however, action is needed to remain competitive.


Liquidity Incentives are nice, but projects need a mechanism to remove existing roadblocks to focus on building long-term value for the ecosystem.


Peripheral service providers like research collectives, market makers, auditors (economic & security), marketing/growth/retention platforms, infrastructure providers, etc., want to get more involved with the ecosystem but are unsure how.


The proposals hitting the forum are starting to get chaotic, and without proper focus and solid bedrock, we will continue to see growing governance fatigue. Teams are getting frustrated with the politics and time commitments, and we must cap the growing time waste and disdain.


Arbitrum can address these issues with a constructive and robust grant program.
We can architect an ecosystem grant program designed and overseen by elected project stewards to fund impactful projects and initiatives quickly and effectively. Constructed so that individual components can be hot-swapped when course correction is needed. This proposal aims to establish buy-in from the Arbitrum Community, elect the founding stewards, and get the process moving. The first deliverable will be the specifics of the frameworks, discussion, and submittal for ratification by formal vote.
Rationale
The roundtable model has precedent in Arbitrum’s governance through the Security Council’s and Data Availability Committee’s role in Administration. Thus, this is considered a just and fair mechanism for carrying out the process. The roundtable stewards and support team’s immediate focus would be to:

Onboard Support Team through RFP Process
Determine & Discuss the service categories eligible for shared resourcing or individual project grant spending through key pillar discussions.
Create procedures to onboard & approve service providers for eligibility for grant spend.
Create criteria for projects to apply for consideration for grant funding and to utilize shared resourcing, including reporting requirements.
Create documentation and procedures with clear code of conduct requirements for service providers and grant recipients.

This is an example of the documents the roundtable would look to produce for ratification; however, this will be a fluid and iterative process, and the attached links are in no way final.
To avoid doubt, this proposal requests the remit to own and execute a grant framework for established projects in 2024. For early-stage and pre-launch projects, there are other initiatives like AIP-3; these definitions will be part of the deliverable.
Stewards should be projects with a deep understanding of the Arbitrum Landscape and a community to tap into.  Treasure ARC stands out to me as a great example.
Stewards should not expect compensation. The steward’s project will be eligible and encouraged to apply for grant funding post ratification (abstaining from self-voting). This can be changed after sufficient value has been established; however, it should not be expected until the grant process is in flight.
There will be a need for support. The Roundtable will need roles like:
Project Manager, Treasurer/Finance, Transparency & Reporting, Design & Marketing Assets, Technical Implementation, etc. - an initial budget to establish these roles with known Arbitrum contributors for two to three months is the only immediate funding ask.
The first month will have stewards and support focus on exploring these key pillars.
The first deliverable presenting an extensive framework for ratification.
If the proposed framework can not reach quorum or AIP ratification, then the initiative shall cease.  If the proposed framework is ratified, it will continue under the terms outlined in the then-approved framework.
Specifications
The Special Operations Roundtable will oversee the administration and governance of the pilot grant program:

9 Total Stewards - There will be nine total stewards on the Special Operations Roundtable. 8 stewards will be democratically elected by the community to represent diverse perspectives. The 9th steward will be the proposer of this initiative; I am happy to drive the efforts forward until I am no longer needed and will abstain from voting unless, in an instance, there is a deadlock amongst the eight elected stewards. Election formalities to follow this onchain vote method.

Roles
image1200×798 155 KB
Initial Direction - To be included in the proposed framework.

6-Month Terms - Stewards will serve terms of 6 months. Elections will occur every 6 months, allowing stewards to be re-elected or replaced by the community over time. This must follow strict procedures that may enable methods outside a typical AIP approval flow; however always under DAO control. To be included in the ratified framework.
Three Seasons - The pilot grant program will target three seasons for 2024. Grants will be evaluated and approved each season. Each season to allocate 25mm ARB across projects (capped amount) and shared resourcing.
600k ARB Operating Budget - An additional 600,000 ARB will likely be requested to cover costs associated with administering the pilot program. To be included in the ratified framework.
Grant Categories - The program will utilize pre-defined categories with recommended parameters around funding amounts and eligibility. To be included in the ratified framework.
Evaluation Criteria - Grant applications will be evaluated based on criteria such as team, project details, estimated impact, and value-add to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Both quantitative and qualitative factors will be considered. To be included in the ratified framework.
Legal Compliance - All necessary legal documentation and compliance processes will be required for funded grantees. Stewards will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure proper procedures are followed.
Proof of Work and Integrity - Comprehensive data will be collected from funded projects to gauge performance and impact.  Including self-reporting and third-party monitoring and enforcement. To be included in the ratified framework.

Elections
Phase 1 - Nominee Selection (7 days)

Any Arbitrum native project who received the STIP can register as a steward candidate.
Community members are encouraged to change delegates if desired.
Support RFPs are encouraged to submit at this time.

Phase 2 - Member Selection (7 days)
2a - Full Weight Voting (3 days)

Community votes with the full weight of delegated ARB.

2b - Decreasing Weight Voting (4 days)

Community voting weight decreases linearly to 0.
The eight nominees with the most votes at the end are elected stewards.

Phase 3 - Grace Period (7 days)

Delay before elected stewards take office to hold official meetings.
Stewards to discuss staff/support needs.

Implementation Timeline
If approved, post elections, the following timeline is proposed for implementing the pilot grant program:


Ratification by End of Year: The goal is to have the Grant Framework proposal ratified by the end of the year. (Pre Ratification)


Pod Set Ups: Stand Up Proof of Integrity and Proof of Work Independent Assessment Pods to monitor Grant disbursement progress. (Post Ratification)


Three Seasons in 2024: The pilot program will run for Three Seasons in 2024. Exact timelines to be included in the ratified framework. (Post Ratification)


The goal is to have the pilot grant program operationalized on this timeline, with 3 full seasons of funding completed within the first year. This will allow sufficient time to gauge results, correct the course, and determine any changes required before expanding the program further.
Budget Requirements
To fund the immediate coordination needs, the following budget allocation is requested from the DAO treasury:

200k for Onboarding Support Contributors to help research, coordinate, draft, and get the framework ratification ready.

Any ARB remaining from this operational budget at the end of the framework proposal will be returned to the DAO treasury if ratification is not reached. Any further ask will be included once value and preparedness have been established through the approved grant framework.
Transforming Vision into Action
Implementing this pilot grant program will provide tremendous value to the Arbitrum ecosystem, allowing the DAO to fund impactful projects and catalyze development. The pilot approach allows experimentation and validation of the best strategies to incentivize activity and growth.
The Vision
image1000×1000 122 KB
Projects get the funding needed to make a long-term impact on the ecosystem, and service providers have an opportunity to work directly with projects.  A huge benefit of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.
Comprehensive data collection and public accountability will ensure funds are used productively and transparently, building trust in the community. Oversight by proof of work and proof of integrity pods in lockstep with elected stewards puts community representatives in control over the direction and priorities of ecosystem funding. The process will be transparent, with regular update posts on progress, recorded meetings, and verifiable steward vote tracking.  The accountability will not solely lie with the Project Steward but also with their respective community, enabling far-reaching involvement.
If the pilot proves successful, the model can be expanded and refined in subsequent iterations, establishing a robust, sustainable grants framework tailored to Arbitrum’s needs. But for now, we are focused on executing this initial proposal to get a framework ratification ready and look forward to your feedback on how it can be strengthened.",1

however, spinning new groups which go in independent directions to test different strategies should already be covered in a pluralistic strategy. How about including your plan of action in the PL mandate and coming back with results of a test case?",2
19101,dk3,2023-10-23 18:34:51,"Hey!
Plurality and Questbook are more positioned for microgrants, focusing on small grant items, whereas this is more for the next evolution of STIP for larger ticket grants.
However, I do see some benefits in reviewing the recommendations and processes that will likely come out of AIP3.
Think the next step of STIP will be a large undertaking, and necessitate a large number of community members to actively participate in gathering consensus, thus, tapping projects with active communities will be key.",3

Could you provide clarity on how the roles, responsibilities, and processes of the Roundtable will integrate with or differ from the AIP-3 framework? Additionally, how will the Roundtable contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of the grant allocation, and what mechanisms will be in place to ensure transparency and community involvement?

AIP-3 is more focused on microgrants or prototypes for projects typically in the early stages of development. However, I believe there will be some shared learning, AIP-3 is more of a shotgun type of allocation of small grants, whereas the Roundtable will be larger allocations to established projects building on Arbitrum. The Roundtable will target larger research projects like shared standardization or cross-project margin. Ecosystem level bug bounties, auditing agreements, or marketing campaigns. Syndicated deals to reduce infrastructure costs, think pooled RPC costing, Graph costing, etc. Establish streamlined ways to remove hurdles that Arbitrum Projects face, so Arbitrum Projects can focus on building.



 englandzz:

ould you provide clarity on how the roles, responsibilities, and processes of the Roundtable will integrate with or differ from the AIP-3 framework?


I made this fancy graphic for you.
AIP-3 is ran by Plurality Labs and their delegates to explore funding exploratory projects or early-stage ideas and is limited in grant allocation. The Roundtable will focus more on established projects and shall act as the spiritual successor to STIP.
The Roundtable will be made of 9 Arbitrum Projects - Their appointed Steward, and their communities. The Steward’s focus will to establish the procedures to request larger ticket grants, what those grants can be spent on, to help coordinate on shared research, resources, or costs.  They should have communities to lean on for example Treasures ARC program, the Premia Parliament, GMX Blueberry Club, etc. As a Steward it will be important to gather their community’s interest when passing a vote on any contested decision.
The support group will be specific service providers that carry out unique tasks or responsibilities on behalf of the Roundtable.  This could be onboarding approved third-party vendors that grant spend can be used on, to create research reports on the most effective grants, to monitor approved grants for compliance, etc.

 englandzz:

what mechanisms will be in place to ensure transparency and community involvement?


The Calls of the Roundtable will be recorded or even streamed if there is interest to ensure nothing is hidden, any contested decision that would require a vote by the roundtable would be done on an Arbitrum subspace so the Arbitrum DAO could see how each steward is voting as well as for what reason. Regular updates will be posted on the forum so the community has ample capacity to weigh in on what has been achieved or the direction the Roundtable is headed. Then as stated above, Stewards should be working with their respective communities to address any community-specific desired outcomes.
The ultimate deliverable being a framework for a cyclical grant process that can be streamlined, removing unneeded bureaucracy and governance fatigue by the wider DAO. However, with mechanisms in place to hot-swap stewards or components out if the DAO thinks the program is not going in the desired direction. Then to kickoff this process in early 2024.",7
19101,limes,2023-10-25 22:40:38,"Overall, I’m supportive of a Large Grants initiative with a trusted and capable group but have a few questions:
If you were benevolent dictator, how would you allocate $75 million in ARB? What does the allocation look like and what is the estimate on how effective it is?
What metrics will be used to quantify success for the pilot program? I see the evaluation criteria, which evaluates the project team, but do you have grant evaluation KPIs.
How were the budget amounts determined?
These are my initial questions ",8

 limes:

If you were benevolent dictator, how would you allocate $75 million in ARB? What does the allocation look like and what is the estimate on how effective it is?


Ultimately up to the roundtable, however, my recommendation would be:
25mm per quarter

5mm for Shared Resources

1mm for Financial Statements
1mm for Smart Contract Auditor on Retainer
1mm for Economic Auditor on Retainer
500k for Bug Bounty (Must have Prior Audit to be Eligible)
500k for Market-Maker Services on Retainer
250k for Infrastructure Costs
250k for Integrity/Work Pods (Monitor Grant Recipients/Onboard Service Providers)
250k for Reputation, Retention & Engagement (Galaxe, Layer3, etc)
100k for Technology Research & Recommendations
100k for Legal Services on Retainer
50k for Recruitment Services



20mm for Projects
Cap on a per-project basis at 500k = 40 Projects
If larger than 500k per quarter, ask to go through an off-cycle process.
I believe most economies of scale will come from shared resourcing, which will be on a first come first served basis. By grouping needs of a per-project basis together costing should drop significantly as well as operational hurdles that each project faces in isolation today.



 limes:

What metrics will be used to quantify success for the pilot program? I see the evaluation criteria, which evaluates the project team, but do you have grant evaluation KPIs.


The proof of work/proof of integrity pods would be in charge of establishing standardized metrics or KPIs on what makes a successful grant allocation. Some may be more qualitative than quantitative, but will ultimately depend on the sector of the project.  For example, a governance-based KPI may not have the same KPI as a DeFi Project. However each initiative that a grant allocation is used for should establish baseline reporting that can be found here: Memo: Report Reqs for Grants.



 limes:

How were the budget amounts determined?


25mm per quarter for three quarters I think, is a good round number for a pilot program.
Regarding the 500k for 2024 Operational costs, I figured 3 full-time roles to support at 150k per individual, plus 50k for small project spend. With this said, depending on feedback to either scale up or scale down happy to change this. Right now, I am expecting the roundtable members and their communities to work pro-bono on this initiative, as they ultimately benefit from a robust grant framework.",9

Also by having team specialized for that a lot of things could be done in a more efficient manner.",10
19101,vxToasted,2023-10-27 05:30:28,"Hello all,
Makes sense to me to have a council of sorts for the largest/most engaged Arbitrum projects to meet, discuss and plan both STIP grants as well as network and discuss whatever needs to be said with each other directly in a group setting. I’ve seen and participated in various projects where the largest stakeholders have group meetings to discuss and plan anything from allocations, governance as a whole, and even just feedback to core team members and it’s been helpful every time.
Handling STIPs, and also generally having meetings of the minds, I think also would be best separate from the new-project funding discussed in the first reply in this thread, which seems it will focus on finding new projects and applications to persuade to join Arbitrum (and is mostly made up of a singular team of people), whereas it seems this will focus more on the more institutional/established side of funding. Letting people focus on specific things seems better than having the 6+2 people in the other proposal do the whole thing.",11

You can see how a polycentric framework makes sense given all the initiates going on.
Also a reworking of timelines to allow for 3 “Seasons” in 2024 makes sense, with Introspective Review periods to pivot and course correct if needed, I will fold in.
Another topic that came up is when there is a conflict of interest for example a grant proposal from a competitor for any projects in that sector to abstain, should we have extended roundtable members to tap in/out in those scenarios, I think its a good idea, and will work that into the proposal as well.
Lastly, it has been raised that 500k may not be enough for an operational budget, will take a deep dive and revisit, also 1mm for Smart Contract Audits will not go very far, so will need to establish rules for what type of use cases qualify for shared resourcing spend.

18995,ZER8,2023-10-17 15:58:23,"Investigation Findings and Decision Regarding NFTEarth Grant Funding
Dear Community Members,
We wish to notify you of a dispute regarding NFTEarth during the Arbitrum on Gitcoin Grant Funding Fest. The purpose of this document is to share the outcomes of our investigation and the subsequent decision.
Dispute
Multiple community members flagged a “bad actor” in the grant round. Additionally, their STIP proposal was flagged.
Decision
Plurality Labs* has decided to exclude NFTEarth from receiving the matching funds payout from the recent Gitcoin on Arbitrum Funding Fest. Remove eligibility from all Plurality Labs grant programs and recommend the same for other Arbitrum grant programs.
Reasoning
The investigations centered on identifying projects that exhibited behaviors falling into the following categories:

Proven bad actors within the web3 community.
Misuse of funds, improper representation, farming
Grant emulations, fake projects that simulate the behavior of genuine grants.
Other malicious activities, including projects involved in sybil attacks, round farming, or other extractive or prohibited actions as per our eligibility criteria.

Out of the 51 approved projects, one project, in particular, has been actively pursuing payouts while invoking multiple reasons. This raised concerns that the project may fit into the scenarios outlined above (1 and/or 2). After thorough scrutiny of the project, specifically NFTEarth, we uncovered the following:

Improper representation - The leadership of NFTEarth is closely linked to that of L2DAO, a known bad actor in the web3 community. (Reference: L2DAO Grant Usage Final Summary)
Misuse of funds - An investigation into L2DAO revealed mishandling of funds received. (Reference: L2DAO Investigation Summary)
Inappropriate reaction - threatening round admins and using alternate accounts to simulate the appearance of an upset community

Supporting Evidence
During our investigation, multiple individuals, some associated with the grant program and others not, came forward and indicated that NFTEarth is known for its unfavorable reputation within the web3 ecosystem. We also reached out to multiple Arbitrum delegates and Optimism community members familiar with the incident there.
NFTEarth’s reaction to our inquiries was hostile. First, the NFTEarth team initiated contact with our team members and exerted pressure to expedite the distribution of matching funds. Upon presenting the evidence linking them to L2DAO and the allegations of misconduct, NFTEarth’s response was to assert that they were being unfairly targeted due to their innovative and competitive approach. Subsequently, they resorted to making threats against our team members in our Telegram channel.
Additionally, tweets were posted from an account primarily used for retweeting NFTEarth posts, accusing our team of involvement in various unfounded and illogical malicious activities.
Background
It is important to note that all grants within Plurality Labs programs are subject to the discretion of both the round manager and Plurality Labs*. While we aim to maintain transparency to the extent possible, we reserve the right to withhold specific reasons for our decisions. Our overarching commitment is to promote fairness and ensure the integrity of our grant programs.
We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work diligently to uphold the principles of transparency and fairness in our grant allocation processes.
*Plurality Labs holds the right to disqualify any grant from a program it manages. These grants always reserve the right to appeal via snapshot vote. Plurality Labs will always uphold the results of a direct vote on Snapshot which reaches quorum.",1

We uncovered behavior clearly showing @DisruptionJoe is not suitable to be leading a grants program of this nature, and have - since posting - now received this response.
Are there any Delegates that will look into this situation that genuinely care about the decentralized nature of why we are all here? These abuses of power shouldnt be tolerated in web2, and especially in web3 - we hope to shed insights on how to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem. Grants will be a huge component no doubt, but if said program is managed by the wrong party, it could have serious and negative long-term consequences to the Arbitrum community and ecosystem.
Since raising our concerns: 1. we have been made aware we will not be receiving our earned $ARB matching funds, and 2. banned from the Telegram group.




 Delegate Violations: Investigation Into disruptionjoe.eth to Determine Suitability for Managing Grant Program Grants Discussions

All of these outragious claims refer to one single Forum post over on Optimism that has been written by a person that has been paid for it.
People like @Dicaso & @FractalVisions defamed and attacked the NFTEarth Team for almost a year now. (There is a reason that they have been suspended from OP and there are hundreds of sceenshots of them acting maliciously towards NFTE)
Delegates like @ZER8 & @DisruptionJoe let this defamation continue in their official Telegram groups without stepping in.
Also noted that these people had nothing to do with the ongoing Grant Round, they we’re invited by someone to systematically attack the NFTEarth Team again.
Last but not least, @ZER8 called NFTE a scam infront of other protocols and continues to do so on the Forum.
I wanna end this with a short fact check:
Official Statement from Optimism about NFTE breaking rules and dumping Tokens
There is none.
Official Statement from Optimism about misuse of funds
There is none.
Is NFTEarth Layer2DAO?

18995,0xWeston,2023-10-18 00:03:45,"Hello Arbitrum Community and Delegates,
I am responding on behalf of the NFTEarth Team. This has not been a pleasant post to write, and this entire situation has just gotten so unbelievably out of line - that it needs to be put to bed once and for all - which I will be doing in this post.
The action you have taken today demonstrates lack of integrity, goodwill towards others, and competence in performing the necessary due diligence to successfully navigate the work you have been tasked with completing. What you did here by singling out an innocent team is undeniable grounds for an escalation of this matter to the farthest possible extent - until the real truth is revealed for all to see, which our team is fully committed to seeing through. My intent is that this post leads to a swift resolution.
It’s important for anyone reading this to understand some context first off. For you to deny a grantee their matching funds after opening a proposal for an investigation into your behavior directly against you - is not only retaliatory in nature, but downright predatory. It is absolutely unacceptable tolerated by the community here at Arbitrum, or in any web3 community.
In your report you have laid out 3 points, I will go through them all one by one, and address each with irrefutable proof that discredits them, and then I am demanding ACTION needs to be taken by Delegates and Admins for this malicious attack and the opening of a discussion for an immediate vote to suspend @ZER8 @DisruptionJoe and Plurality Labs from managing any additional Arbitrum Grants as well as clawing back all funds awarded to Plurality and any other grant program these individuals are associated with.
As you will see, the due diligence and care they put into their investigations is not thorough, it is highly inaccurate, and is without any doubt, not a representation of how a credibly neutral party would act - as they are intentionally targeting a specific group. These are all the characteristics a grant committee should NOT possess, and define what it means to not be credibly neutral, yet you have put them all on clear display with this report.
Let’s begin:



 ZER8:

The investigations centered on identifying projects that exhibited behaviors falling into the following categories:

Proven bad actors within the web3 community.
Misuse of funds, improper representation, farming




Your Reasoning falls into these categories:

Proven bad actors within the web3 community
Misuse of funds, improper representation, farming



 ZER8:


Improper representation - The leadership of NFTEarth is closely linked to that of L2DAO, a known bad actor in the web3 community. (Reference: L2DAO Grant Usage Final Summary )
Misuse of funds - An investigation into L2DAO revealed mishandling of funds received. (Reference: L2DAO Investigation Summary )
Inappropriate reaction - threatening round admins and using alternate accounts to simulate the appearance of an upset community



Then specifically, you cite 3 examples that support this reasoning, which are all lacking in substance, and factually incorrect. Let’s go through them 1 by 1.

L2DAO is not a known bad actor in the web3 community. Is this a factual statement? L2DAO received a grant from $ARB for supporting Arbitrum over the past couple years and has one of the strongest communities in all of web3. Your reference is to a report written by no one on the official Optimism Foundation, it is a summary thread written by someone with their own opinion on an accusation made, nothing more than this. This cannot be, nor should it ever be considered as the basis for making decisions of this nature involved here. This thread you cite cannot be used to discredit L2DAO nor NFTEarth, and by you bringing L2DAO into this matter, you have directly slandered their brand name as well as NFTEarth, spreading damaging libel and slander to both protocols that is unnecessary, and entirely reckless.

I am providing screencap evidence directly from the Optimism Foundation that invalidates your entire claim and that entire report. The FINAL SUMMARY - directly from the Optimism Foundation, which was handled in private, was that the OP Foundation asked the team to consider the entire event as a warning, and to make sure that conduct is aligned with the spirit of the Optimism Collective going forward. This confirms, irrefutably, no wrongdoing by L2DAO nor NFTEarth.
CASE CLOSED.
I am providing first a screencap of the members in this chat, which include 6 official Optimism Foundation members, including the founder, and the 3 members from L2DAO. Please see below. I wish I was not forced to share private conversations like this in public forums as this is unnecessary, but this is something you cannot refute anymore now.
Optimism Foundation - L2DAO Chatimage658×860 60.4 KB

Misuse of funds - an investigation you are relying on, again, not formally written by ANYONE at the Optimism Foundation, but rather competitors with a grudge. The source you used is not a legitimate source.

With this screencap below, I am providing evidence to directly refute your statement,  proof that this is false: Please see the screencap from the Optimism Foundation issuing the final resolution to L2DAO that was nothing more than a warning to the L2DAO team, and also please note, that there is absolutely zero mention of NFTEarth.
Official Optimism Foundation image828×924 136 KB


Inappropriate reaction.

You cannot use a lies to justify a this criteria having merit. ie, no round admins have been threatened, and so that voids this rationale in its entirety. You are blatantly lying.
There have not been any threats made, I would suggest we use that word mindfully. I have expressed disappointment in a process that has been emotionally draining, confusing, and promised funding for a hard-working team, and then delivered us absolutely nothing. My reaction to be angry, upset, and confused is absolutely acceptable, and if you argue otherwise, I think you need to take a good look in the mirror. As stated when we joined this round, My goal was to get funding for our team to keep building, because we had our lead dev, who has a wife and children, living in Jakarta, and is LITERALLY starving because we need funding. This is why we came here. Please show some humanity. The last screencap is from our direct conversation with OP Foundation, discussing the hostility in the Optimism community, that we were trying to resolve. My colleague pointed out some clearly inappropriate comments made by Jack Anarak, the Optimism representative you have mentioned as a reliable source of information before, in the public Optimism Discord.
Please review this screenshot thoroughly:
image723×670 107 KB
As you can clearly see, our goal when working as a team was only ever to create positivity, inclusiveness, and overall find solutions to sometimes what can become very tricky situations when bad actors get out of line. This report you filed today is an example of a bad actor, behaving inexcusably out of line and we will be pursuing every possible angle to ensure that fair and reasonable resolution provided to the NFTEarth team, myself for the libel I have had to ensure, and our other team-members for the same.




 ZER8:

Your points on supporting evidence:
*This supporting evidence you presented is entirely baseless and is literally nothing more than here-say, there is no material here: and I mean zero factual representations or actual proof of wrongdoing in any sort. Multiple individuals? At this point, I take this to mean @dicaso and @fractalvisions is whom you refer to at this point as there has been no one else has seeming to have any issues with us - just competitors with clear motives.
Your next point on asking about funding:
*Expanding on this: Exerting pressure for funding? Please re-read what I posted. We are in urgent need of funding. If you are going to describe us asking where our fairly earned matching funds are, and not be able to provide a reasonable answer, I cannot see any problem with us asking again. If you want to call this exerting pressure to expedite the distribution, feel free to, but it took me 2 minutes to run the quadratic funding calculation and there is no reason we should not have received the funds by now, especially with the circumstances we entered the round under. Both you @zer8 and @disruptionjoe were EXPLICITLY aware of our team situation upon round the beginning of the round application, even before we applied. It is not ok to say we have been exerting pressure when we are in urgent need of funding, have won said funding, and there remains no sign of said funding. It’s called: following up.
Your last comment:
*Tweets from an account that the NFTEarth team has no control over is also baseless because this is outside of the scope of the team or my control, there is literally nothing we can do to control what others choose to say on Twitter. It doesn’t matter what they say, the team CANNOT control another users Tweets. In our team report filed to the Arbitrum DAO about the violations of @DisruptionJoe as a Delegate though, we do go into further mention of these Tweets because the onchain evidence presented is confusing to say the least, and we believe it is in the best interest of all Arbitrum Delegates to have clarity on why Joe is getting $OP payments while managing an Arbitrum grant round. We would challenge the notion that it is possible to remain credibly neutral managing a program for Arbitrum when the managers are being paid in $OP and $ARB at the same time. Think about this for a second please. It is not possible, and what was uncovered regarding Joe’s onchain transactions definitely warrants cause for further investigation at minimum.

I hope this clears things up.
As always, I am available on X, Telegram, and Discord.
Sincerely,
Weston Nelson",5

19077,krst,2023-10-20 19:00:27,"The below response reflects the views of L2BEAT’s governance team, composed of @krst and @Sinkas, and it’s based on the combined research, fact-checking and ideation of the two.
With the STIP voting now behind us, we wanted to write a post to share our view of the entire process, our reasoning for voting the way we did, and the lessons we learnt along the way. We also want to take the opportunity to congratulate all protocols for submitting great applications, all the parties involved with bringing the STIP to life (and especially @tnorm and @Matt_StableLab for spearheading it), as well as all the delegates who put in the effort of reviewing and voting on all the applications in such a short time frame.
Process
First off, we believe we speak for everyone when we say that we didn’t anticipate the volume of applications the STIP received. We were overwhelmed by countless requests to review applications and offer our feedback to the point where it became impossible to do so. As a result, we adopted an “everyone or no one” policy which basically meant that we’d only do something if we had the capacity to do it for everyone, or we wouldn’t do it at all.
After going through the applications that made it to the final stage, it became apparent that it wouldn’t be easy to objectively assess all the proposals based on a shared set of evaluation points. Given that, we decided to create a basic rubric that would take a more general approach and then subjectively assess each application after collectively reviewing and discussing them internally.
However, having a rubric introduced a new problem; it quickly became overwhelming to actually score each application. So what we settled with is to use the rubric we created as a reference point when assessing applications, but not restrict ourselves to simply the score produced.
We won’t go into details about the score of each application as we feel it’s outside the scope of this post, but we will explain our rubric and how we used it.
Our Rubric
We separated our rubric in 2 parts: 3 core aspects and 6 secondary aspects that we used as a discretionary modifiers.
Core Aspects

New Capital


The effectiveness in bringing in new capital to Arbitrum. We also tried to determine how sticky that capital would be after the incentives ended, based on the structure of the incentives.


New Users


The effectiveness of the proposed use of funds in bringing new users to Arbitrum, and how effective the structure of the incentives would be in user retention.


On-chain Activity


Last of the 3 core aspects was whether the project applying would create on-chain activity, and ideally recurring activity that would last beyond the timeframe of the incentives.

Secondary Aspects

Novelty


How innovative was the project, or how they differentiated themselves from other projects in the same category.


Size of project


The size of the project itself, in terms of TVL, DAU, Volume and even subjective brand recognition.


Composability with other projects


Whether the project applying is collaborating with other projects, how many, and to what extent.


Size of grant request


The grant request in comparison with that of other projects, the size of the project (as per above), and the justification for the size.


Grant breakdown


How the requested funds would be used, and what percentage would go towards what.


Alignment with Arbitrum


Protocols that were exclusive to Arbitrum scored higher from multi-chain protocols simply because they are better aligned with Arbitrum. However, we did keep in mind that some protocols (e.g. bridges) are inherently multi-chain and we scored them accordingly.

In the future, it might be beneficial to the entire process for the program to have a rubric or assessment framework built into it so both applicants and delegates can have a reference point of what to focus on. That will make the whole process much smoother for everyone involved.
Voting
There has been some discussion around the use of “Abstain” and what it means vs what it’s supposed to mean. We wanted to address this to clarify how we voted in the way we voted.


For - We voted in favor of applications which not only scored high in our rubric, but which we also subjectively believed were properly balanced.


Against - We voted against applications which scored low on our rubric, or applications which we subjectively believed were not balanced.


Abstain - We voted abstain for applications that we were on the fence about and for which we had no strong reasons to vote against, but we weren’t compelled to vote in favour of either. So in practice we treated it as a “soft against”.


We tried our best to be as objective as possible when assessing applications, even though the volume of applications received, as well as their diversity both in nature but also in context and grant requested made it a difficult and often a necessarily subjective task.
Looking Forward
In our view, the STIP initiative was a great experiment that yielded lots of valuable information which can be used and adapted to future iterations of it, or in similar programs. It’s very important that each application receives enough time, effort, and ultimately feedback from delegates, something which didn’t really happen this time around, at least to the extent we’d want it to, given the time constraints.
Some thoughts for the future:

Perhaps introducing a cap on the numbers of applications for each round of STIP can help mitigate the overwhelming task of reviewing and providing feedback to every applicant.
We need to have some sort of a system in place to ensure that each proposal gets reviewed and has feedback offered before the voting process begins.
A thorough analysis of the applications received in Round 1 of the STIP could help with emerging some patterns (e.g. common components across applications in a specific category) which could be used as building blocks or application template in the future.

I don’t think lobbying is necessarily a bad thing; it helped a lot of projects come together in ways they were not before, but some ground rules of what is not tolerated we should think about and work into ratification eventually.
Rules

No bribing or buying votes.
No unwanted pestering of delegates to promote your proposal. Maybe a public status if the delegate is willing to be contacted.
No lying or false claims about contributions or past impact (including metrics)
Voting on proposals in which they have a direct or indirect undisclosed financial interest? (Self-voting/partner-voting is okay)
Delegates to be transparent and disclose any relevant information that may influence their vote, available publicly.
Delegates to not use their position for their own private gain or for that of persons or organizations with which they are associated personally.
Retaliation - Spreading of misinfo for a project that doesn’t vote for you; idk

Considerations

Review the proposal and any supporting materials before casting your vote. (We were able to get through all proposals; we did use abstain as a soft-against to still add to their quorum total, yet to keep total allocation under 50mm)
Consider the proposal’s potential impact on the community and the ecosystem as a whole, does it encourage sticky users/txns/vol.
Consider the long-term sustainability of the proposal and its potential to contribute to the growth and development of the ecosystem ie exclusivity deals, projects that can generate a lot of txn throughput etc. Small volume today, big volume in future.
Consider the potential benefits of the proposal for ecosystem users, quality of life improvements, privacy protecting projects, etc
Consider the diversity of the project and the potential impact of the proposal on all community members or projects. Dev tooling, wasm stylus formal verification, wallet tagging, order flow, ecosystem market makers, large ecosystem LPs, retainer auditing services, etc.
Maybe some more forum mods to shutdown inappropriate conjecture/noise.

19077,maxlomu,2023-10-22 21:21:40,"Thanks @krst and @dk3 for sharing insights. I align with your views and I’d like to share some key takeaways.


Let’s acknowledge and remember we’re in a bear market. Projects are keen, if not desperate, to draw TVL, gain traction, and attract more buyers/investors. As a builder, I empathize with their grant-seeking efforts, yet there’s a need for clear boundaries.
Ok lobbying, ok voting for your partners, but we need to find ways for delegates to be more impartial, and for newcomers to have a shot at kickstarting and bootstrapping their projects - otherwise we’ll end up with an ossified number of players and low innovation.


The crypto realm is unique—no other sector would have disbursed $50m with merely a few weeks for due diligence on proposals and projects. I found myself somewhat overwhelmed and under-equipped to review all proposals in that timeframe—this model suits team delegates but individuals will invariably need to prioritize based on familiarity or dedicate time to research selected few projects.


My objective was to review first the smaller projects, enabling them a shot at grants. This approach had mixed outcomes—per feedback, it did help some projects in gaining visibility and securing their STIP. However, toward the end, as clear winners emerged, I hadn’t delved into the mid-tier projects that could have benefited from my votes to surpass the threshold.


Casting a ‘no’ vote requires courage, meriting more respect. Many delegates felt the strain to only vote for Yes, and I faced backlash for my decisions. I feel we need to devise better mechanisms for individuals to vote freely and without pressure.


I have been criticized for focusing on projects that made Arbitrum their primary home (“how can you say that when you work for a bridge?”) . I support this position, and I believe we should design retention mechanisms to overcome “chase-the-incentives” mindset common among crypto builders.
The Blue Pledge is a fascinating idea, and I think more experiment in this area will determine the success or failure of Arbitrum.


We now need data to measure outcomes and impact of each grant, evaluate which ones were most successful, and use these insights to drive new rounds.

18883,Midgetwhale,2023-10-13 23:34:12,"In light of the recent STIP vote I think there are a couple takeaways that we should try to improve on for future votes.
One of which is in my opinion the all-or-nothing nature of distribution of funds.
This probably caused significant levels of stress and responsibility for all actors involved, both teams/communities as well as the key delegates.
It also leaves us with a whole slew of good projects that ended up with no incentives just because they only managed to convince one or two top delegates less than some of the projects that did get the full request.
If a project provides great value to Arbitrum and the grant request has a lot of merit to it but it is simply deemed too excessive in the eyes of many delegates, the voting process itself should adjust this concern by just allocating a more proper amount.
Therefore I propose that in the future, funds should get distributed on a pro rata basis.
See the following simplified example of how funds could have gotten distributed instead.
I.e.
Project A asks 10M ARB
Project B asks 7M ARB
Project C asks 3M ARB
Total ask = 20M ARB
Budget = 10M ARB
Project A gets 100M votes
Project B gets 200M votes
Project C gets 50M votes
Now multiply the votes with ARB requested:
Project A: 10 x 100 = 1000M
Project B: 7 x 200 = 1400M
Project C: 3 x 50 = 150M
Total: 2550M
Now divide the budget with the total Vote*ARB:
10M / 2550M = 1/255th
Now multiply this factor with the Vote*ARB request per project:
Project A: 1000M/255 = 3.9216M ARB
Project B: 1400M/255 = 5.4901M ARB
Project C: 150M/255 = 0.5882M ARB
Total distributed is 10M.
This gives every project that reaches quorum and a 50% in favour vote at least some part of the funding.
In addition to this, I would also opt to count the net total of votes (i.e. FOR votes subtracted by AGAINST votes) as otherwise an against vote is mostly useless.
As an example: This is what the distribution of the recent vote would have looked like if distributed as proposed.

18883,SnF_NFT-Fi_Leo,2023-10-14 14:18:33,"This is really interesting and makes a lot of sense, especially considering the current stalemate of the DAO having approved more tokens than the budget it itself approved, which doesn’t make any sense.
A detail that is also impactful is that the projects were asked to make a proposal with great details on how they would spend the budget they were requesting, and if the amount received was a fraction of what they were requesting, this would force the projects to make an adjustment to the initially proposed campaign.
Therefore, I believe a draft should be required for the campaign, and not necessarily with a huge detailing.
However, I also share the view that it is much better to distribute grants in the hands of as many projects as possible and since the budget is finite, this pro rata division is what seems to make the most sense.
By the way, excellent example you used, however I believe we should still leave some room for projects for Round 2.",2

18987,NFTEarth,2023-10-17 10:43:58,"Abstract
This AIP proposes an immediate investigation into the actions of @DisruptionJoe - AKA disruptionjoe.eth, a Delegate involved in managing grants distributions for Arbitrum and operating through Plurality Labs as well as his documented colleague @ZER8. The investigation aims to address highly concerning and well document and identified violations in behavior in order to assess the suitability of the current team managing grant distributions on Arbitrum as this is of critical timeliness and also extremely important for the long-term future of the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Motivation
It is imperative to maintain a non-toxic governance culture on Arbitrum, reflecting the values of inclusion, diversity, and innovation set forth by ArbitrumDAO and Arbitrum Foundation. Recent incidents involving DisruptionJoe.eth and program manager Zer8 during the Gitcoin Funding Round Fest have highlighted a deviation from these values. disruptionjoe.eth actions, such as public inquiries and attempts to undermine the NFTEarth Team, are a violation of community guidelines. This AIP is to seek immediate investigation into the team managing the grants distributions for Arbitrum.
Rationale
To uphold Arbitrum’s core values and ensure a positive growth environment, it is essential to address the incidents of bullying, denial of rightful grantee funds, and disregard for repeated complaints. An objective review of the delegate and grant distribution team is necessary to evaluate their suitability for the roles they currently hold. ArbitrumDAO and Arbitrum Foundation has made it absolutely clear that its values are inclusion, diversity, and innovation. The Arbitrum Community Guidelines, viewed here:  make this very clear and if this is true, this needs to be addressed, as bullying, denying grantee funds they have been rightfully awarded, and overall disregard for repeated complaints by the NFTEarth Team for unfair treatment, by the exact same actors is never going to create a positive environment conducive to growth. This issue has been recently escalated based on communication occurring in the Arbitrum Gitcoin Funding Grant Fest Telegram, to which an NFTEarth team member Weston, asked a straightforward and clarifying question about the new grants round which was being discussed by /DisruptionJoe/Zer8/GroupAdmins, and Joe redirected this question - entirely and completely out of context, in order to incite toxicity:
image1204×464 84.5 KB
Other Grantees were also clearly confused by his question to a question answer and bring up a STIP discussion that had - after viewing for 5 minutes, can be clearly well understood, and had been thoroughly addressed in the forums as well, but Weston did follow up with a full answer, which can be viewed here in the screencap here:
image1227×494 79.2 KB
The purpose of sharing these two screencaps is of critical importance because it shows the intent of DisruptionJoe - and this is what we are intending to shed light on, that we believe based on our firsthand experience, he should not be running any sizable $ARB grant program and doesn’t act in good faith for Grantees that will be looking to participate, thereby creating a potentially very damaging scenario for the Arbitrum ecosystem.
In creating the sequence of events that has now turned hostile in this Telegram group…which you can now come join to see for yourself, called the Arbitrum Gitcoin Grants Funding Fest, the environment of the group has turned into complete negativity, fighting, and hostility: Telegram: Contact @ArbitrumonGitcoinGrantsFEST
The Delegate and team in question are entrusted with the distribution of millions in $ARB and must exhibit a high level of responsibility and integrity. However, recent events have shown that the conduct of this team, encouraged by DisruptionJoe and Zer8, is not in line with these fundamental requirements. Their actions aimed at spreading libel and obstructing the growth of the NFTEarth Team on Arbitrum underscore their unsuitability for such a critical responsibility. This same group has been approved for a substantial grant allocation of 3,360,000 $ARB to distribute via grants. It is evident that having bad actors in charge of such a significant grant management project is detrimental to the entire ecosystem, undermining the core principles of transparency, fairness, and trust.
For further reference, DisruptionJoe’s involvement in the grant proposal can be viewed here: AIP-3 Non-Constitutional Fund the Arbitrum Grants Framework Proposal.
Specifications
Based on documented incidents, it is evident that DisruptionJoe.eth actions were aimed at creating hostility and toxicity within the community and were not aligned with the expected conduct of a delegate. Consequently, a fair review of the grant system is proposed, with the possibility of forming a committee to replace DisruptionJoe.eth to guarantee an unbiased evaluation of protocols seeking adoption on Arbitrum. He has allowed brand new members to join in on the conversation to continue the bullying, such as @Dicaso after clear and factual evidence of Dicaso repeated attempts to harm the NFTEarth team and by larger effect, the Arbitrum ecosystem. Please see the screencap of the Post on X that Discaso sent out publicly the day after the NFTEarth team announced their excitement for being included in the Arbitrum Odyssey which is still live and seen in this screencap on the Odyssey page:
image1044×835 86.2 KB
This image contains a warning: to users on Arbitrum. States as fact that using the NFTEarth protocol is a fraud, and that users would lose all their money by interacting with the contracts.
Any quick simple review of the OpenEdition NFT deployed by NFTEarth will determine this is 100% untrue in every capacity, demonstrating Dicaso’s blatant libel, and @DisruptionJoe  encouraging this type of behavior. This should never be tolerated.

Proposed Actions and Remedies

Conduct a thorough investigation into the actions of disruptionjoe.eth and the grant distribution team, examining the incidents and assessing their compliance with community guidelines and delegate responsibilities.
If deemed necessary based on the investigation, form an impartial committee to oversee grant distribution and evaluate new protocols aspiring for adoption on Arbitrum, ensuring a fair and transparent process.

Steps to Implement
The investigation will commence immediately, with a retroactive review of the Gitcoin Funding Round Fest (September 19th, 2023 - September 30th, 2023). The findings and subsequent actions will be communicated transparently to the community, fostering trust and accountability within the ecosystem. The Arbitrum on Gitcoin Funding Fest (which concluded on September 30th, 2023) can be reviewed here:
image1501×850 211 KB
Timeline

Start Date: Immediate (retroactive to the Gitcoin Funding Round Fest, September 19th, 2023 - September 30th, 2023)
Conclusion: To be determined based on the investigation, aiming for a swift resolution.

Overall Cost

Anticipated Legal Costs: Potentially significant for resolving damages incurred by NFTEarth.
Investigation and Committee Formation: No direct cost anticipated, relying on the dedication and cooperation of the community and relevant stakeholders.

We were made aware that Joe received $OP the day before our $ARB gramt round started and this raised several red flags. It seems reasonable to investigate this to understand the nature of the relationship with Optimism and Arbitrum because being that they are HIGHLY competitive rollups, i find it nearly impossible for any grant program administrator to remain impartial and credibly neutral if they are being compensated by both networks. The entire premise of their argument is that because the same (@Dicaso and @FractalVisions) keep making accusations about the team, well then the team must not be good. They have not presented a single piece of actual rational or onchain evidence of any wrongdoing - yet when a call for additional review is asked for, the IMMEDIATE response is to deny the team their earned matching funds? I thought Arbiscan was a DAO.
Further proving the point, upon our investigation being released, the @NFTEarth team has nust been made aware they will NOT be receiving ANY of the earned $ARB matching funds. So key point being… speak up, get censored. Is this the message Arbitrum wants to be sending in trying to attract new builders? I don’t think so.

Weston Nelson controls the NFTEarth account making this complaint. He also likely controls the Crypto Cave account  currently making physical threats of violence against @DisruptionJoe on X.


A quick search  on Google reveals public records that the Crypto Cave was created by Weston Nelson according to facebook records.
Weston is indeed acting as a third party in an attempt to manipulate the Arbitrum governance into thinking there was some sort of wrong doing from an alternative account that had been setup.
Don’t be so naive to think that you can simply hide information that is already publicly available. It doesn’t take more than a few minutes to put together the puzzle pieces on this case.
This type of behavior from a grantee should not be tolerated.

18184,Vaultka,2023-10-04 07:50:22,"Suggestion on sharing grants proportionally in the future
As we wrap up the review phase for the first round of Arbitrum STIP, it’s truly heartening to witness over 100 protocols enthusiastically submitting their grant proposals and sparking vibrant discussions within our community.
Nonetheless, based on the 50M budget set by the community voting previously, only a small portion of the proposals will get the funding with the current framework proposed by @tnorm. Funding will be allocated based on the number of votes in favor of the proposal if the 50M budget threshold is exceeded, which means that proposals with the most yes votes will get funded first, and the list keeps going down.
In light of this, for future grants, we suggest a proportional distribution of grants based on the amount requested by each proposal in relation to the overall sum of approved requests. This approach aims to ensure that every project receives a fair share of support, aligning with the community’s intentions and maximizing the impact of our grant program.

Quote from @tnorm in FAQ
We do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 50M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated based on the amount of votes in favor of a proposal, and secondly (if there are any exact ties) on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum.

Current Situation
As of the figures on 3rd of October, the total grant request from the top 10 projects (According to their grant request size) has already exceeded 50m. Larger protocols are likely to receive all the grant allocation with advantage in receiving more votes and garnering recognition from delegators. Given the current framework, it leaves limited opportunity for smaller scale protocols to benefit from the grant even with much smaller grant requests.
In fact, more than 70% of the protocols are applying for a grant less than 1mil ARB. Each of these protocols introduce innovative solutions and add diversity to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Protocols like GoodEntry and Stella pioneer with new investment strategies and incentive mechanisms for users, and there are numerous more protocols diligently working on innovative solutions, collectively enhancing our ecosystem.
image940×581 116 KB
Suggestion
Given the tight schedule and the advanced stages we in, we understand that suggesting a new grant distribution method for the STIP program may not be the most suitable. Nevertheless, looking ahead to future grant proposals, we’d like to suggest an alternative approach: Distributing grants in proportion to the size of each passed-voting applicant’s request.
The voting quorum will serve as a safeguard against malicious actors seeking to receive funds. Applicants would need to strike a balance between requesting substantial amounts in case the total request exceeds the budget, while receiving votes from delegators.
Using the STIP grant as an example, if ultimately there are 80M grant requests passing the minimum voting requirement (71M quorum and over 50% favor votes), where 5mil of that are from smaller scale protocols requesting less than 1m, this suggestion can release 6% (3mil ARB tokens) of the budget to support smaller scale protocols. This would not only foster diversity within the Arbitrum ecosystem but also empower smaller projects, further enriching our community.
We welcome discussions and suggestions from fellow protocols and the community, as we believe in collaboratively strengthening the Arbitrum ecosystem.",1

18184,mfer,2023-10-10 15:00:19,"Agreed.
The system used this time showed a lot of flaws in its core design which makes it far from fair and inclusive.
In my ow perception reading the forum, this method brought some TOXIC VIBES that were non existent before at this scale, or at least I didn’t notice it. I mean between devs themselves and between community members. Everyone has been witness of significant amount of people spending more time attacking and trying to harm/sabotage other protocols applications rather than supporting and highlighting the qualities of their favorites.
Legit but not beautiful.
‘Limited entry’ policies like in the STIP promote this kind of behavior.
Besides, a handful of big delegates decided the fate of all participants, with the shadow of the conflict of interest always being there. Some delegates are directly involved with some applicants. Some officially, others not. We have to TRUST that delegates can fully separate personal from professional.
Coincidentally most of OG protocols have gotten their proposals approved and passed very quick even asking for significant amounts while their direct competitors from a later gen don’t get the same treatment. This promotes the ESTABLISHMENT and status quo while punishes the progress and innovation in the long term.
Even in some cases I’ve seen protocols being DISCRIMINATED for not being born in Arbitrum. I see the word ‘native’ being used too often I guess. There’s a thin line between patriotism and nazism… I’m just saying we all should be careful with which values we want to embrace and show off as a community. I’d like Arbitrum to be very open to foreigners and new comers. A home for everyone willing to contribute.
Wrapping up…
This STIP distribution method is too arbitrary, too centralized, too wild, and relying too much on trust.
Hey, this is not criticism but just an assessment afterwards from my pov. It is the first enterprise of this kind in this community and it’s absolutely normal to be far from perfect. However it is important that we all are able to learn during the process and improve. That can’t be achieved without constructive criticism and solution proposals. And that’s what this topic is about.
I stand with @Vaultka on their proposal to apply changes. Although I’m not sure if is the best we can come up with, at least it seems better than the current one and improves some aspects. I’d give it a couple tweaks though:
1- Removing quorum treshold. Bad actors mentioned by Vaultka would be filtered out during the prior approval phase. Quorum benefits bigger applicants so much.
2- No votes against. What’s the point of voting against someone if there is no battle royal and everyone will get their piece of the cake in proportion? This will also avoid sabotage practices and bad voting actors. Who am I to vote against someone who I might even don’t know or I didn’t even use? That’s a cancellation culture imo. Let’s focus into vote pro something.
3- No votes abstain. It is not needed if there is no quorum.
4- No min allocations but max allocations. Everyone will eat. I suggest a max allocation of 7% of the total budget to one single applicant. Any vote that surpasses that limit simply won’t be counted.
Formula: [Total votes in favor for a given applicant (cut at max of 7% votes form total votes count, if applies)] divided by [Total votes in favor from all proposals] multiplied by [100].
The result is the percentage of the total budget that will be allocated to that given applicant. Rinse and repeat for every other applicant.
All these measures turn the system into something more:
- Decentralized.
- Non-arbitrary.
- Trustless.
- Inclusive.
In general is more fair thus making more people happy/satisfied, making them feeling part of it and so paying back with POSITIVE energy which always builds the most wholesome and vibrant ecosystems.",3

18576,AssetBackedNFTs,2023-10-10 11:10:34,"With reference to grant proposals.  We have a unique gaming concept (don’t roll your eyes!);  keen to know whether we’d be eligible for a grant if 100% of the grant would be used for marketing (to encourage crypto/game speculators to fund the game.).
Appreciate any thoughts/advice.",1
18576,sahijeevan,2023-10-11 15:03:20,yes need great think like this,2
17816,PSY,2023-09-29 12:16:05,"As of yesterday we had a maximum request of 124,442,102 ARB in total but the cap is 50M (https://x.com/PSYTWEAK/status/1707337387280326957?s=20), not all of that needs to be approved but if the large players pass it will leave very little for the rest of the community to share.
Instead of rationing out ARB like baked beans in a food shortage, would it not make more sense to have the largest players side step STIP and go straight into asking the DAO for a grant? Leaving the 50M for the other 90 or so teams to play with?
doesn’t make much sense to me to have the community favourites and best performing teams competing with small up and coming projects for the same pot of cash. It’s going to lead to a least half of the teams getting declined this round and it pressures big teams to ask for less than they need to execute their plans, does that encourage a welcoming ecosystem?",1
17816,sagarvai,2023-09-29 12:21:47,I think you are spot on here. Big players like GMX GNS VERTEX etc should get the amounts directly from ARB DAO,2
17816,JoJo,2023-09-29 13:22:25,"This would be the equivalent for the DAO to make more funds available for the STIP program. Which, if i remember correctly, was also written down in the proposal as a possibility.",3
17816,sagarvai,2023-09-29 13:28:06,The dao got like 60M arb back which was unclaimed from airdrop. So they can definitely do this,4
17816,SuRa,2023-09-30 07:26:21,"Good point, perhaps if this doesn’t come to fruition then it’s logical to lower the demands of all protocols by an equal percentage, but again we need to wait for the voting results to go about it.",5
17816,0xWicked,2023-09-30 10:25:58,"The core issue here isn’t about dividing up ARB, but rather the urgency of setting the grant program in motion. We need to ignite the flame, get things started.
The STIP is a solid initiative pointing Arbitrum in the right direction.
It’s not meant to cover every nuance of an ecosystem. Its primary goal should be ensuring momentum. Getting things off the ground, distributing initial grants, evaluating outcomes, and iterating.
An agile approach is key here.",6
17816,zkCyborg,2023-09-30 10:46:09,"0xWicked, you make a valid point about the primary goal of the STIP program being to ensure momentum and get things off the ground. Indeed, agility in the early stages of ecosystem development is crucial. However, the concern raised by PSY about large players potentially taking up a significant portion of the allocation does warrant consideration.
One possible approach could be a tiered system within the STIP program. Large players could still participate but with certain limitations on the amount they can request, ensuring a more equitable distribution of funds. This way, both established projects and smaller up-and-coming ones can coexist within the ecosystem without excessive competition for resources.
What are your thoughts on implementing such a tiered system within the STIP program to strike a balance between encouraging established projects and supporting emerging ones?",7
17816,relied,2023-10-01 12:01:35,"I disagree with this take. 50m is the reduced amount because of inflation concerns by the community. “ Leaving the 50M for the other 90 or so teams to play with” is nothing else but completely abandoning this first decision (yes, one can seriously question why this happened in the first place where everyone suddenly morphed into stingy accountants).
Anyhow, this is the framework that we have to work with now and use the funds most reasonable to 1) not being wasted / mishandled by teams with low reputation / malicious intentions 2) create stickiness to the arbitrum ecosystem.
I’m not against funding projects that are less established like the big players, but I do believe in the concept of performing first before awarding free money to those projects (as in real life )",8
17816,Vaultka,2023-10-03 09:11:09,"Thanks @PSY for raising this out, and we, Vaultka truly share similar thoughts with the author. As of the figures on 3rd of October, the total grant request from the top 10 projects (According to their grant request size) has already exceeded 50m, reaching over 53million. This situation leaves limited opportunities for smaller size protocols to benefit from the STIP program. Even if smaller projects meet the 71m quorum and secure over 50% of “For” votes, larger protocols are still likely to dominate the grant allocation. This is because grants are distributed based on the amount of votes in favor when the total request exceed 50m (based on the explanation from @tnorm below), and larger protocols enjoy a significant advantage in receiving more votes and garnering recognition from delegators.

We do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 50M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated based on the amount of votes in favor of a proposal, and secondly (if there are any exact ties) on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum.

This is opposite to the original intention of the Arbitrum STIP program, which is to strengthen the growth of the whole Arbitrum Ecosystem, rather than just the top few protocols on Arbitrum.
Nevertheless, we acknowledge the concern from @relied regarding the responsible allocation of funds to prevent misuse by teams with malicious intent. Thus, given the framework that we have, we propose that if the cumulative request amount passing through the voting requirements exceed 50m (meeting minimum quorum of 71m, and getting over 50% for votes), the 50Million grant should be distributed in proportion to the grant request of each protocol. This approach ensures that a significant portion of funds remains with established protocols, guaranteeing that resources are entrusted to experienced teams with a proven track record. Simultaneously, it maintains the competitiveness of smaller protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem. We believe this approach better aligns with the initial purpose of the grant – to strengthen the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole",9
17816,karelvuong,2023-10-04 12:48:01,It’s a bit of a nuanced answer as I can see both sides but here’s the perspective from TreasureDAO that I published yesterday which described us deciding against participating in STIP for this reason (among others): https://x.com/karelvuong/status/1709315736483569768,10
17816,543,2023-10-05 02:39:14,"The problem identified here is sadly a real one… but i think the current proposal has already passed and there isnt much we can do about it (or can we?)
but imo this can serve as feedback probably for future STIPs or incentives…
here are some options (incl. those above) that could maybe help this a little bit…
(added it as a multiple-choice poll so you could just quickvote to show your inclination…)


1 - Bigger projects with bigger needs can make a direct proposal to the Arbitrum DAO for a grant.
2- Arbitrum DAO could increase the 50m ARB allocation to about 100m to accomodate everyone (this can cause serious inflation!)
3 - 50m be divided proportional to the asks of all the applicants eligible for a vote. this means everyone gets about half of what they asked for!
4 - Arbitrum DAO could allocate the 50M into the current 4 tiers (Beacon/Lighthouse/…) and then projects compete for votes within their own tiers.
5 - Big protocols (like Treasure DAO above) should sidestep and not apply for a STIP to make room for the smaller protocols.
6 - Something else? Reply button is your fren!

18252,blarthy,2023-10-05 01:40:38,"Abstract
This grant submission aims to integrate TBYs, the pioneering commercial debt token carrying no KYC requirements or transfer restrictions, yet fully collateralized by US Treasury Bills, into the Arbitrum environment.
Our advocacy revolves around the profound potential of TBYs within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Blueberry Protocol humbly requests the DAO representatives to contemplate the incentivization of the issuing protocol, Bloom, to deploy on the network, fostering growth on Arbitrum via the lowest risk high yield lending rates for USDC and an valuable new yield token primitive to be used across other protocols.
Crucial to this proposal is the legal and regulatory classification of TBY, which is not categorized as a security. Legal classification and explanation is provided as well as links to follow up and read more on this topic. We possess legal opinions from top law firms giving us their opinion which we can share with the delegates of DAO.
Introduction
Project Description: Blueberry Protocol operates as a lending and leveraged borrowing market ecosystem built on Ethereum, specializing in the field of TradFi assets under its Bloom lending marker line where TBY token is minted. Bloom brings yields from the US Treasury into the DeFi economy with its two permissionless and compliant products: TBYs (loans which behave like T Bills) and stUSD (yield-bearing stablecoin backed by TBYs). All TBYs(debt tokens) are 102% collateralized by US Treasury Tokens (collateral provided by qualified KYC’d borrowers).
TBYs behave similarly to US T Bills, paying out a fixed-term yield over a 6-month period that can be redeemed at maturity. One of TBYs’ core objectives is to offer near-treasury rates to the DeFi space, at scale, with a focus on jurisdictions where traditional KYC norms have proven unfavorable. With no KYC prerequisites and a risk profile similar to a US Treasury Bill, TBYs provide our clients a delta neutral fixed income alternative, facilitating borderless accessibility unlike its traditional counterpart.
Twice per month, Bloom will open up minting for a 3-day period for that month’s TBY. Users mint TBY with USDC, and are paid out in USDC at maturity. Further information about mints can be found via: TBYs - Bloom Product Docs
Motivation
Increased Volume and Adoption
Empowering the Arbitrum financial ecosystem with increased volume and adoption through TBY’s by Introducing a non-KYC on-chain token with same characteristics as the US Treasury Bill can attract a larger number of institutional users, especially from regions where strict KYC verifications hinder access to traditional financial instruments. This can boost the volume of transactions on Arbitrum and enhance its adoption rate in emerging markets. TBYs also serve as a composable yield token that can be utilized in dexes and lending markets to drastically improve organic non-reward yields. When combined with reward tokens, yields can exceed double digits without introducing significant economic risk vectors.
Boosting DeFi Activities
The introduction of a stable, risk-free asset like the TBY can provide a foundation for more complex DeFi products and strategies, such as collateralized lending, yield farming, AMM’s and Bribes.
Liquidity and Stability
TBY’s can bring significant liquidity to the platform. The predictable and relatively stable returns of TBY’s (T-Bills) can also act as a counterbalance during volatile market conditions, ensuring greater overall stability in the Arbitrum ecosystem.
Starting with a boost
Bloom has garnered significant attention within the Arbitrum community. Key platforms like Dolomite are poised to integrate Bloom as a lending market. The synergy between RWA protocols and ve(3,3) DEXs, exemplified by partnerships with Chronos Exchange, offers immense potential. Such collaborations allow partners to incentivize with genuine yield, thereby accelerating TVL growth and RWA adoption on the Arbitrum chain.
Rationale
Permissionless systems embody the spirit of decentralization. By enabling a non-KYC TBY Token fully backed by US Treasury bills, Arbitrum would be promoting a financial product that does not have centralized gatekeeping. This ensures that the platform remains true to its roots by offering unobstructed access to global financial assets.
One of Arbitrum’s guiding values is to enable a more inclusive financial system. By integrating a non-KYC TBY token, Arbitrum can reach users from regions with strict financial regulations or underserved by the traditional banking sector, granting them exposure to stable, low-risk assets traditionally reserved for more mature markets and privileged jurisdictions who are US KYC friendly.
US Treasury bills are considered one of the safest financial instruments, given that they are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. By offering TBY’s, a token backed by such a reliable asset, Arbitrum reinforces its commitment to security and reliability in the financial products available on its platform.
We are aiming to use Arbitrum to bridge the gap between traditional financial instruments and the tenets of DeFi This can attract a wider range of users and liquidity providers who are seeking both innovation and stability. Along with having this process facilitated on-chain, provides clearer transparency into the process and the inner workings.
In summary, a permissionless, non-KYC US Treasury bill backed token (TBY) on Arbitrum can align seamlessly with the platform’s mission of promoting a decentralized, secure, and inclusive financial ecosystem, all while pushing the boundaries of innovation in the DeFi space.
Grant request specifications
The primary objectives of the requested grant are as follows:


Enhance the Arbitrum network’s sustainability by recruiting and integrating new users, thereby amplifying the total locked value (TVL).


Foster the advancement and proliferation of the USDC LST called stUSD, yield farming strategies, and the embrace of fixed income offerings, with a particular focus on Real World Assets (RWA’s).


Champion a robust and scalable ecosystem featuring a ‘risk-free yield’ asset accessible to all participants.


Through this grant, Blueberry Protocol seeks to introduce TBYs to the Arbitrum ecosystem, establishing its pioneering stance as the inaugural on-chain, non-security classified US T-Bill token, offering the most secure crypto transaction available today.
Grant Value
We are asking for your support to approve the grant of 119,604 ARB worth of incentives which will be used to incentivize minting of TBY on the Arbitrum network.
Tokens will be distributed as follows:

Yield farming, stable pools (TBY-stUSD And TBY-USDC): 50,000 ARB
Direct minting incentives: 20,000 ARB
Yield Farming, stUSD-partner token pools: 29,604 ARB (stUSD can be used as a paid asset to reduce the cost of liquidity for partner tokens)
Operational expenses / infra: 20,000 ARB

It is now clear that the overall amount of funding requested for the round 1 of STIP far exceed the 50M arb that were put on the budget through voting. While the final number is still subject to change due to protocols adapting their proposals to the feedbacks of delegates, and so the overall number will probably trend down, we are currently north of 100M arb for the total amount, and chances are that we will stay way above the 50M funds assigned to the program.
All users probably want a clarification of the above screenshot, taken from the STIP main thread. If possible, with practical examples.
It would be also interesting to start discussing about the DAO unlocking further funds looking at the success of this program.",1

15927,shawn16400,2023-08-18 12:50:58,"We’re very excited to announce the launch of the Arbitrum Domain Round on Gitcoin Grants!!

$100k DAI allocated to 4(+1) future funding pools
Future funding pools will include $100k DAI plus direct donations
Future funding pools correspond to Questbook domains
Future funding pools will source grants which could “graduate” to Questbook
Future funding pools likely to run in September on Artbitrum!
Visit & vote at the Arbitrum Domain Round homepage

Meta-Round Decentralized Domain Allocation
This round is a unique experiment. Unique because the “grants”’ in the Domain Round represent the future matching pools of the next funding round. This means that the Arbitrum community will decide how to allocate the funding pool between the four (+1) domains selected by the Questbook grant program (4) or signal interest to another TBD domain (+1).
Votes are calculated by looking at direct donations of DAI using the Gitcoin user interface. The additional direct donations will also be included in the future funding pools. This means that $100k of Arbitrum community funds will provide more than $100k in builder support!
 We will also gather great data around who is a true supporter of these domains.
AIP-3 Gitcoin Partnership
The Arbitrum Domain Round is the first Arbitrum initiative launched in partnership with Gitcoin. This move combines the size and power of the Arbitrum Community with the ethos of Gitcoin and the magic of quadratic funding. AIP-3 officially passed on Monday evening on 8/14. Gitoin will complete the deployment of the Allo protocol on Arbitrum and integration to their Grantstack UI in early September. This quick commitment to the partnership will enable us to run the Future Funding Pools on Arbitrum!
As a reminder, the Gitcoin partnership has a few components that kicked-off with the recent passing of AIP-3. Gitcoin has committed to prioritizing the deployment and integration work needed, collaborating on hackathons & supporting builders, and marketing support. Arbitrum has earmarked 300k $ARB to future funding pools which choose to run on Arbitrum. Plurality Labs is excited to lead the charge!
About the domains
1.Gaming: This will help Arbitrum encourage more developers to create innovative gaming experiences and thus onboard new users to its ecosystem
2.Developer tooling on Nova: This will help Arbitrum build essential infrastructure, tooling for Arbitrum Nova
3.New protocol idea: This will encourage more contributors to propose and run experiments for improving the Arbitrum protocol
4.Education, community growth & events:This will help Arbitrum attract quality builders through community growth activities such as education courses, bootcamps, hackathons and sponsoring events
5.Open pool: choose this round if the prior four rounds don’t speak to you!
Plurality & Coordination
The rounds listed above were approved by Arbitrum voters in the ratification of Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook proposal. This grant process builds on that proposal by measuring the relative community support for each domain, and adds a fifth category which includes “everything else not covered”.
At a governance call, Questbook was asked “What could be the one thing that could cause this program to be unsuccessful?” It was a tough question. Their answer was the difficulty in sourcing enough quality grants. This two phase round is designed to help mitigate this potential problem while also gaining insight into the preferences of the DAO.
Call To Action
Vote on Gitcoin
What should community members do? Go to the Arbitrum Domain Round homepage. Press “donate” to cast your vote for how you want the $100,000 DAI to be allocated across the five domains. Your donations are the votes and quadratic funding preferences of the many in agreement over individual large donations.
Note: anyone can participate in this round, but only wallets containing Arbitrum will be counted towards calculating the domain allocation.
Spread the Word
Tweet about the round and follow the ArbitrumGrants twitter account.
FYI

Only donations from wallets which held $ARB on 8/15/23 AND passed our sybil check are eligible to have their donations count as votes.
The direct donations and the $100k funding pot will be held in the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig after the round and until the payout of the future funding pools.
This round is on mainnet due to the timing of GG18. We felt the marketing push of running as a featured round alongside Gitcoin’s flagship program would be worth the gas cost.
After both phases are completed, we can perform an analysis of the gas cost and user experience on mainnet vs Arbitrum

Use Sablier for the Arbitrum Foundation’s grants program.
What is Sablier?
Sablier is a token streaming protocol available on eight chains, including Arbitrum. It is the first of its kind to have ever been built in web3, tracing its origins back to 2019. Similar to how you can stream a movie on Netflix or a song on Spotify, Sablier lets you stream money every second.
The Sablier protocol features a streaming model Lockup, in which the sender locks up a specified amount of ERC-20 tokens in a contract. The contract progressively allocates the funds to the designated recipient, who can access them as they become available over time. The streaming rate is influenced by various factors, including the start and end times, as well as the total amount of assets locked up.
For more details, please visit our website and our documentation.
What problems does token streaming solve?
Traditional payroll and token vesting suffer from three key problems.


Payments need to be made manually over a long period of time, requiring ongoing efforts from the grant management team. Conversely, Sablier streams only have to be set up once. You just have to provide the total duration of the stream (can be a month, a year, or even multiple years) and that’s it — there’s no further action needed from you again, ever.


Grants, as we know them, have issues. The traditional approach relies heavily on milestones or lump sum payments, either upfront or at the completion of the project. However, this poses a risk with grantees potentially abandoning the mission after receiving a part or the whole grant. Conversely, grantees have to wait for the milestones in order to receive their income, and payment delays sometimes happen.With token streaming, none of these problems occur, as the grantee is paid by the second. If the grantor notices that the grantee stopped working, they can simply cancel the stream, and get the funds back which haven’t yet been streamed.


Discrete payments lack transparency because it’s hard to aggregate them. When the tokens are streamed, anyone can check the Sablier interfaces to monitor the status of a stream and all transactions associated with it. Here is an example of a stream.


Why should the Arbitrum Foundation use Sablier?
Sablier is entirely free to use, has no token, and is a proven solution with (at the time of posting this) a TVL of $117M+ according to DefiLlama. The protocol was first launched in 2019 and quickly received support from MakerDAO. Today, Sablier’s token streaming solution is used by teams like Shapeshift, Nouns DAO, Astaria, Reflexer, and others for token vesting and payroll purposes.
Streaming on Sablier can be done by manually calling our contracts, via our interface, or via our Safe multisig app, making it a great fit for any set up. Every stream is associated with a unique link, which makes it easy to share the status of a stream with other people. Streams can be canceled by either the streamer or the recipient, which prevents any dead-end situation if an employee/contributor leaves or if certain KPIs aren’t met while the stream is still running.
Conclusion
Sablier is a protocol that has stood the test of time and that can provide the Arbitrum Foundation with a great web3-native solution for grants. We would love for you to become a Sablier user.

Our contract addresses can be found in the docs.
TVL of $120M+ according to DefiLlama across all versions of the Sablier protocol, as of July 24, 2023.
Security: two audits from Cantina, plus five other audits from both individual auditors and other auditing firms. Sablier has been around since 2019 with 0 hacks and a cumulative TVL of over $1.5B.
Fees: just like Uniswap, we have a built-in protocol fee, which is currently set to zero. We have no plans to adjust it any time soon, as we are focusing on growth and will be for a long while. If we ever do adjust the protocol fee, it will be applied to new streams (the fee is paid when creating the stream), not the ones already created.
Control: Sablier is completely decentralized, permissionless protocol for token streaming. We have the ability through a multisig to update some of the protocol’s configuration parameters, but the core part of the protocol is decentralized and immutable. We have no access to user funds. See our governance page in our documentation for more info.

15830,stonecoldpat,2023-08-11 21:57:16,I moved this to the Grants Discussion forum as Sablier might be relevant for more than just the Arbitrum Foundation’s grant program.,2
15830,lindsey,2023-08-12 18:40:12,"As a long time supporter of the Arbitrum ecosystem, I’d like to add comment and propose that Hedgey is considered for the platform used to distribute and manage token grants for the Arbitrum Foundation’s Grants program.
Background on Hedgey
Hedgey creates onchain token streaming products and over the last year has worked with Gitcoin, Shapeshift, Celo, Index Coop, BanklessDAO and other great DAOs  to create vesting, lockups, and grants solution through our free, public goods solutions.
History supporting Arbitrum
We first began supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem a year ago and have since been creating the tools that help DAOs and protocols deploy and grow on Arbitrum.
Why should Arbitrum use Hedgey?

Hedgey is a token streaming solution that allows grant issuers to set up one or multiple grants in a single transaction and reduce the management overhead by the foundation while streamlining grant issuance and management for recipients. Both issuers and recipients have feature-complete platforms to track and manage grants.
Hedgey also allows for the ability to distribute grants via stream. These grants can be both revocable or non-revocable, pay out in continuous streams(every second) or periodically (weekly, monthly,) and include hyper-customized features in grant creation. New grants cost pennies to create and can be created individually or up to 40 in a single transaction.
Hedgey allows grant issuers to optionally create and share public dashboards where an entire grant program can be shared with the broader DAO. Here is a demo public dashboard featuring Arbitrum.

Unique reasons to use Hedgey for grants

Hedgey Grants can be set as transferable, non-transferable, and transferable-by-admin. Our approach to grants allows DAOs to restrict how grants can move and restrict them from being sold.
Hedgey is completely free with no fee switch.
Hedgey allows grant issuers to (optionally) add onchain governance rights to locked/vesting token grants. Should Arbitrum want grant recipients to participate in governance with their grants, they will be able to allow it.

Total Cost
Hedgey is a 100% free public good. There are no fees and there is no fee switch.
Security
Hedgey is audited by Consensys Diligence. We are trusted by incredible orgs like Gitcoin, Celo, IndexCoop, Shapeshift and 50+ other DAOs with over 6000 streams/lockups.
Conclusion
Hedgey has been a long time supporter of Arbitrum and is mission driven to help more DAOs grow and prosper by supporting your grants program. As the teams mentioned above will vouch for, we will go hands-on, above and beyond to create an incredible experience for the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem and continue building out the products and features to make the grants program on Arbitrum incredible for everyone.
Thank you for your consideration and support.

Feels a bit undiplomatic to do it here. The title of this post is specifically about Sablier.
The fair way to compare competing solutions is create a generic, separate post specifically for that. And ideally the comparison would not be made by either one of us, but by someone working at the Arbitrum Foundation.",4

15830,lindsey,2023-08-14 19:30:46,"Hi Paul - my intent was not to overstep on you marketing your protocol - apologies there.
I believe a healthy discussion is helpful for DAOs in evaluating service providers, saw this topic, and figured this would be a good place to have a discussion.
I’ve gone ahead and created a separate topic (pending approval) and have added a note to encourage other grants service providers to share a note in the thread there. I do think having a discussion in a single place is pretty healthy on a topic like this one. You are more than welcome to copy/paste your proposal there as well.

15830,mainbrain,2023-08-17 00:42:27,"FWIW, Sablier is the creator and as a result, the OG of the token streaming service.  I would put a lot of  confidence in them as an OG in the space for 4 years as a result.  Since so many protocols use gnosis safe multisig app, supporting safe, is icing on the cake IMO.  I really think that Sabliers usage for vesting is the right call, especially in a grants program.  If milestones aren’t hit or someone rugs, cancel and refund the remaining stream.",11
15830,eBaykc,2023-08-22 05:26:51,"The use case for Sablier is clear and straightforward. Personally, I’m excited to see it used for token vesting in newly launched Arbitrum projects. By gradually releasing tokens to holders through Sablier streams, it prevents a few whales, VCs, and insiders from simultaneously dumping their tokens on newcomers to the market. Sablier will undoubtedly transform crypto payments in everything from grants to HR. However, creating a fair and healthy market, and preventing mercenary capital from sabotaging projects before they have a chance to thrive, is perhaps my most compelling reason for supporting this proposal.",12

Use Hedgey to distribute and manage grants for the Arbitrum Foundation’s grants program
Note: I originally posted this in Sabliers grants thread but moved it over to a separate Topic to have better discussions. Fundamentally, I think having an RFP approach to selecting any service provider is the healthiest approach and would welcome Sablier to copy/paste their topic in this thread as well as any other service provider share their grants tooling. Ultimately the best outcome for the DAO is one where all options are discussed together.

Select reasons to use Hedgey Grants as a long term solution

Hedgey Grants can be set as transferable, non-transferable, and transferable-by-admin only. This is a small but significant configuration in how grant recipients are able to interact with revocable grants. Should the DAO not want recipients to transfer or sell revocable grants they will be able to restrict those rights on Hedgey.
Hedgey is completely free with no fee switch. There will never be fees to use Hedgey Grants.
Hedgey allows grant issuers to (optionally) add onchain governance rights to locked/vesting token grants. Should Arbitrum want grant recipients to participate in governance with their grants, they will be able to allow it.

Evwrything has been A+ support from the team when we encountered any questions or potential roadblocks when executing the first DAO-2-DAO swap on Arbitrum last year, and also, a great experience using/troubleshooting any items involved with compensating DAO contributors via token locks. On Layer2 scaling networks such as Arbitrum, these sort of web3 solutions like Hedgey are few and far between, and Hedgey stands out in my view in a stellar way here, a great option for this proposed use case.

13099,UGBOMHE,2023-04-02 22:05:54,"Hello everyone,
I would like to suggest the removal of the “Trending Delegates” selection from the Arbitrum DAO site. While this feature may seem useful for identifying popular and successful delegates, it can actually lead to centralization of power by suggesting to delegate to only a select few individuals.
Delegating to a diverse range of delegates is important for maintaining a decentralized network that is not controlled by a single entity. By promoting only the trending delegates, we are essentially telling users to delegate to the same set of people, thereby limiting the diversity and potentially leading to a concentration of power in the hands of a few.
Edit:
Instead of relying on a small group of trending delegates, we should encourage users to explore different delegates. It could be based on performance (not an option as-of-now) or region or just have delegates write a small post which would be displayed on the website. This will not only help users make a more informed decision about who to delegate to, but also promote healthy competition among delegates.",1
